2021-08-16 00:00:00+00:00,Wait for a Pullback Before Pulling the Nvidia Stock Trigger,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/wait-for-a-pullback-before-pulling-the-nvidia-stock-trigger-2021-08-16,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
I remain upbeat on Nvidia’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) long-term outlook. However, I think that the company looks poised to suffer some short-term and medium-term setbacks that are likely to send NVDA stock lower.

Consequently, I advise investors to wait for a meaningful pullback in the name before taking a bullish position in the stock. Why wait? In a word: cryptocurrency.
As I noted in my most recent write-up on Nvidia in mid June, the company generated $155 million of revenue from selling chips used in mining cryptocurrencies. Although that amounted to only 6% of the chip makers’ second-quarter sales outlook, I theorized that weakness in the category could cause NVDA stock to fall meaningfully.
Showing that my hypothesis could be correct, on June 21, the company’s shares slumped more than 3% during the trading day, after China tightened its regulations on the sector.

7 A-Rated, Large-Cap Stocks You Want in Your Portfolio
While the cryptocurrency collapse that I’ve predicted over the last few months hasn’t yet occurred, as of the end of July, the asset class’ momentum had definitely stalled.
Crypto Fall Will Ripple Into NVDA Stock
I believe that cryptos’ recent momentum will prove to be temporary. One reason for my belief is that U.S. lawmakers and regulators appear to be poised to take action against the cryptocurrencies.
The infrastructure bill making its way through Congress tightens IRS reporting requirements for cryptocurrency brokers, and lawmakers expect that provision to increase the government’s revenue collection from the sector by $28 billion. Moreover, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen is lobbying against attempts by members of Congress to “exclude certain crypto companies from the reporting requirements for brokers,” Cointelegraph recently reported.
Although the attempt by a few members of Congress to loosen the requirements appears to have been a key impetus for the crypto rally, I think that the implications for these developments are largely negative for the asset class.
For one, the fact that Congress, in a move that’s expected to force the sector to pay higher taxes, is poised to tighten reporting requirements for cryptocurrency at all suggests that lawmakers are willing to take action against the sector. Meanwhile, Yellen’s willingness to lobby for a harder line on the sector indicates that she’s ready to take additional steps to rein it in.
Meanwhile, SEC Chairman Gary Gensler said that his agency needs more power to effectively regulate cryptocurrency. In my opinion, the statement suggests that Gensler, seen by many as a friend of crypto, also is looking to pull in the sector.
Finally, as I’ve stated previously, I believe that the end of the federal unemployment bonus, set to occur next month, should cause cryptocurrencies to drop as millenials have less money to invest in the sector.
Taken together, I believe that in the short-to-medium term, increased regulation and taxation, along with reduced inflows, are likely to cause cryptocurrencies to plunge, causing NVDA stock to fall meaningfully.
ARM Merger Still At Risk
In a November 2020 column, I wrote that Nvidia’s proposed acquisition of ARM Holdings would create “one of the biggest and best cross-selling/upselling opportunities in history” for Nvidia.
After conducting research for this article, however, I’m starting to believe that there’s a greater-than-50% chance of the deal being vetoed by regulators.
China, which may not want to give a top American chip maker any help, is delaying its decision on the deal, suggesting that Beijing may decide to torpedo the acquisition. Meanwhile, indicating that ARM itself may be growing pessimistic about the deal going through, The Telegraph reported that ARM may launch an IPO if the acquisition is canceled. The U.K. company denied the report, but there could still be some truth to it.
Although Wall Street is skeptical about the deal’s chances of being approved, NVDA stock is likely to pull back to a certain extent if the acquisition is ultimately nixed.
Nvidia’s Long-Term Outlook Remains Strong
I have previously been bullish on Nvidia’s opportunity in AI, and another InvestorPlace columnist, Vandita Jadeja, recently provided updated information on a number of the company’s opportunities involving the technology. Specifically, she cited the company’s Base Command Platform, which she described as “an AI development hub that will provide enterprises with instant access to computing infrastructure, irrespective of where the data is placed. ”
In April, Nvidia launched new AI tools for datacenters, which are using the technology more and more. Nvidia says that its AI technology for data centers is superior to that of Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), which has become a leader in the field of AI for data centers. And Nvidia touts that its new data processing units seamlessly take over tasks from CPUs, allowing the latter chips to dedicate more of their capacity to other tasks.
Finally, I remain upbeat on Nvidia’s long-term opportunity in automobiles in general and autonomous vehicles in particular.
Nevertheless, investors should stay away from Nvidia’s shares ahead of its potential pullback. But, given the company’s rosy future, they should be ready to add NVDA stock on significant pullbacks.

2021-08-14 00:00:00+00:00,3 5G Stocks to Buy Right Now,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-5g-stocks-to-buy-right-now-2021-08-14,,,"The 5G wireless technology rollout is just getting started. Just 30% of the world has access to the network today and an even smaller percentage of consumers own 5G-enabled smartphones. However, it's estimated that we could reach 3.6 billion 5G connections by 2025. Here are three stocks that stand to benefit from the rollout of 5G wireless technology.
1. Making the chips behind 5G
Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM) develops integrated circuits and software to help power connected devices on 3G, 4G, and 5G networks. Its products are used in many smartphones, network and broadband equipment, and other devices (such as the Internet of Things). Qualcomm also develops and licenses out various patented technologies to other manufacturers.
Qualcomm is well positioned as a supplier to the 5G markets. Qualcomm's revenue for ""Internet of Things"" applications was $3 billion in 2020 but has grown in 2021, scoring $1.4 billion in the third quarter of 2021 alone, an 86% increase from the prior year.
Qualcomm supplies Apple with modem chips for the iPhone 12. However, Apple is thought to be developing its own alternative after buying Intel's modem chip business for $1 billion back in 2019. Apple is a significant customer for Qualcomm, estimated to contribute as much as 20% of the company's revenue, so investors will want to monitor any long-term developments in this situation. The two companies are currently partnered under a multi-year licensing agreement through 2025.

2. The network to deliver 5G
AT&T (NYSE: T) is a telecommunications company in the United States where a small handful of companies dominate the industry, including AT&T, Verizon Communications, and T-Mobile. The network carriers are the supporting infrastructure of 5G, best thought of as the roads and highways that transport cars (data) from one destination to another.
AT&T's business is very stable because the high cost of entry (wireless networks cost many billions of dollars to build out) results in a low threat of competition. The importance of wireless networks to society makes AT&T almost like a utility-""mission-critical"" to customers. The company's wireless segment won $138 billion in revenue during 2020 and will benefit from steady device upgrades as customers switch to 5G-enabled smartphones over the coming quarters.
AT&T had tried to integrate media into its business model over the years, buying Time Warner in 2018 for $85.4 billion, but is now spinning its media businesses out in a deal with Discovery Communications that will make AT&T a pure-play telecommunications company once again.
3. Expanding opportunities with 5G
Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ: SWKS) is a company that develops and builds semiconductor products and is a competitor to Qualcomm. The company specializes in chips that filter out interference on communications devices and, like Qualcomm, is a major supplier to Apple.
Apple's business made up 56% of Skyworks' 2020 revenue, but it is diversifying its business to reduce its dependency on Apple. In April, Skyworks announced a deal to acquire Silicon Labs' automotive and infrastructure business segments in a cash deal worth $2.75 billion.
Skyworks will have exposure to both the 5G smartphone cycle and automotive market as vehicles become increasingly connected, which could create long-term growth opportunities for the business following the merger. Skyworks has estimated that resulting applications from 5G technology could double the company's total addressable market.
Here's the bottom line
The difference between 4G and 5G could be as much as tenfold in speed, making 5G technology a true opportunity for innovation to occur across many industries. These three companies operate in the background, supplying the components and infrastructure that make 5G happen, and could bring big returns to patient investors.

2021-08-13 00:00:00+00:00,5 Top Tech Stocks to Buy During a Recession,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/5-top-tech-stocks-to-buy-during-a-recession-2021-08-13,,,"Recessions don't happen often, but they are among the most frightening times for investors when they do occur. Recessions can be dangerous times for riskier stocks and companies that are unprofitable or have unproven business models. To invest during a recession, consider these five technology leaders that have the proven businesses and cash on hand to not only survive, but to thrive in any market environment.
1. A lucrative smartphone ecosystem
Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) is a leading smartphone manufacturer, and its iPhone is the second most popular brand globally. The company has moved well beyond selling phones, tablets, and computers; Apple has built an ecosystem of services that generate recurring revenue, including:
Apple Music
Apple TV+
Apple Arcade
iCloud
Apple News+
Apple Fitness+
Apple also charges a 30% fee on most revenues that pass through its massive App Store. The company generated $274 billion in revenue in 2020 and is very profitable, posting a net profit margin of 20%, or $57.4 billion in net income. Apple had $193 billion in total cash and marketable securities as of its most recent quarter (Q3 2021), so it has plenty of resources to handle a recession.
2. A cloud and business software leader
Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) has a handful of businesses, but is most known for its Windows operating system that enjoys more than 87% market share of the computer market. Its Office 365 software suite is also used by most businesses, and its cloud segment generated $60 billion in revenue in 2021.
These products and services are ""mission critical"" for Microsoft's customers, meaning they need them to function. Switching to a competitor is difficult because it costs time and money to do so, plus the alternatives are few and far between. Microsoft also has $130 billion in cash and equivalents at the end of its 2021 fiscal year, giving the business a ton of financial firepower to endure whatever comes its way.

3. A social media conglomerate
Facebook (NASDAQ: FB) is a social media powerhouse. It owns several top platforms, including Facebook and Instagram, as well as additional app and product companies, such as WhatsApp and Oculus, a company that makes virtual reality products.
Facebook generated nearly $86 billion in revenue in 2020, growing 22% over 2019 despite the pandemic. The company makes most of its money by selling user data to advertisers, who then put ads on Facebook's platforms. When people tend to be going out less and potentially spending more time on social media during a recession, Facebook's business can do very well. The company had $64 billion in cash and equivalents at the end of Q2 2021, its most recent quarter, so it's flush with cash and poised to thrive in a recession.
4. A chip manufacturing powerhouse
Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) is a leading manufacturer of semiconductor chips, including the x86 microprocessor, the ""engine"" behind many of today's computers and data centers. The business did nearly $78 billion in 2020, and $20.8 billion of that fell to Intel's bottom line as net income.
Intel's business has shown to be durable during COVID-19. Revenue grew 8% in the 2020 pandemic year, and as of its most recent quarter (Q2 2021), the company had $4.7 billion in cash and equivalents on hand. Intel's data center group, its second-largest segment, grew 11% in 2020 to $26.1 billion, showing that it's growing through the pandemic challenges. It could also indicate that it's durable enough to thrive through any economic downturn.
5. A little bit of everything in the tech world
Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) is one of the most iconic companies in the technology sector. It is a true conglomerate, with many business segments, including Google search, YouTube, Google network, and Google Cloud. Alphabet's services are used throughout the internet, which has become almost a basic need for the modern world. Recession or not, people will continue to search, email, and watch videos on YouTube.
Alphabet grew its revenue by nearly 13% to $182.5 billion during the 2020 pandemic year, and $40.2 billion of that ended up as net income, representing a net profit margin of 22%. Alphabet's products are also clear market leaders, with product names such as Google, Gmail, and YouTube becoming verbs for consumers. Alphabet's sticky products and services could continue to thrive in a recession, as long as people continue to use the internet. And the company's $135.8 billion pile of cash, equivalents, and marketable securities offers a large financial safety net for good measure.
Here's the bottom line
All five of these companies are massive market leaders, with proven businesses and strong balance sheets. While no company is a risk-free investment, these technology stocks are a good starting point for investors looking for both quality and dependability, even during the toughest of times.

2021-08-11 00:00:00+00:00,Will TSMC Be a Trillion-Dollar Stock by 2025?,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/will-tsmc-be-a-trillion-dollar-stock-by-2025-2021-08-11,,,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) (NYSE: TSM) is the world's largest and most advanced contract chipmaker. Many leading ""fabless"" chipmakers -- including AMD, Qualcomm, and Apple -- rely on TSMC to manufacture their smallest and most powerful chips.
Thanks to the market's growing appetite for new chips, TSMC's revenue has surged over the past few years, and its stock hit an all-time high this February. The stock has advanced more than 300% over the past five years -- but it could climb even higher as the global chip shortage generates fresh tailwinds.
Image source: Getty images.
TSMC currently has a market cap of about $600 billion. Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), which believes it can reclaim the process lead from TSMC by 2025, has a market cap of just over $200 billion. Can TSMC stay ahead of Intel and become the world's first trillion-dollar contract chipmaker by 2025, or will its growth stall out before it hits that milestone?
Why TSMC might hit $1 trillion by 2025
Many analysts and chipmakers believe the global chip shortage, which was exacerbated by the pandemic, will last through 2023. The secular growth of the 5G, Internet of Things (IoT), home automation, data center, and consumer electronics markets should keep supplies low.
Based on these expectations, the global semiconductor foundry market could grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.3% from 2021 to 2026, according to Mordor Intelligence. If TSMC matches analysts' expectations for $56 billion in revenue this year and keeps pace with that estimated CAGR, it could generate $74 billion in revenue in 2025 and $80 billion in revenue in 2026.
TSMC currently trades at about 13 times trailing sales. If it maintains that price-to-sales (P/S) ratio until 2025, it would be worth just over $960 billion. But as a market leader, TSMC could grow faster than the broader foundry market -- which also includes slower-growth companies like UMC and GlobalFoundries.
Between 2015 and 2020, TSMC actually grew its revenue at a CAGR of 11.8% in USD terms. If TSMC outpaces the projected growth of the broader market with a CAGR of 9% from 2021 to 2026, it could generate roughly $79 billion in revenue in 2025. Multiplying that figure by 13 would give us a market cap of $1.03 trillion.
Why TSMC might not hit $1 trillion by 2025
TSMC could be worth $1 trillion by 2025, but three challenges could prevent it from joining the 12-zero club. First, TSMC's price-to-sales and price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios are currently hovering near all-time highs.
TSM PS Ratio (Annual) data by YCharts
Many investors are paying a premium for TSMC because they assume the global chip shortage will drag on. As a linchpin of the global semiconductor market, TSMC is a natural play on this secular trend.
But investors might stop paying that premium if three things happen. First, Intel could gradually catch up to TSMC by aggressively expanding third-party foundry services. TSMC remains in the lead for now, but Intel's ambitious targets for 2024 and 2025 -- in which it plans to match TSMC and Samsung at the 2nm node and beyond -- will force TSMC to significantly boost its capex to stay ahead.
If TSMC fails to stay ahead of Intel, which is seeking the support of government subsidies in the U.S. and Europe to accelerate its plans, its growth could decelerate over the next five years.
Second, a growing number of chipmakers and analysts believe the current chip shortage will lead to a supply glut. TSMC, Samsung, Intel, and other chipmakers are all boosting their capex to address the global chip shortage by building new plants -- but doing so could swing the pendulum in the other direction and result in an oversupply of chips.
Lastly, geopolitical tensions could hurt TSMC. Its facilities in Taiwan, which manufacture its smallest chips, remain vulnerable to a potential attack by mainland China. It also faces pressure from the U.S. to cut ties with Chinese chipmakers and build more advanced plants in the U.S.
Focus on TSMC's core business instead of its market cap
TSMC has a shot at becoming a trillion-dollar chipmaker by 2025, but only if Intel fumbles its recovery, secular tailwinds (i.e. 5G, data center, IoT, vehicles) remain robust and prevent a supply glut, and geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and China wane. If any cracks start to appear, investors could stop paying a premium for TSMC's stock -- and the company could be worth a lot less than $1 trillion by 2025.
That being said, TSMC's core foundry business remains strong, and it will likely remain the world's most important chipmaker through 2025. TSMC's top clients probably won't switch chipmakers simply because Samsung and Intel are ramping up their spending -- so investors should focus more on its core strengths instead of wondering if its market cap will ever hit $1 trillion.

Aug 10 (Reuters) - A U.S. judge has rejected Intel Corp's INTC.O request to set aside a jury verdict ordering the chipmaker to pay VLSI Technology LLC $2.18 billion for patent infringement.
U.S. District Judge Alan Albright in Waco, Texas, denied Intel's motion for a new trial in a sealed order issued late Monday.
Jurors on March 2 had awarded VLSI $1.5 billion and $675 million for Intel's respective infringement of two patents that were once owned by Dutch chipmaker NXP Semiconductors NV.
Intel said in a statement on Tuesday it was disappointed with the decision and intended to appeal. It also called for reforms to prevent ""litigation investors"" from using low-quality patents to extract ""exorbitant"" damages, saying the practice stifles innovation and hurts the economy.
In seeking a new trial, Intel said the verdict was tainted by erroneous jury instructions and evidentiary rulings, and appeared to be based on earlier Intel settlements that VLSI's own damages expert admitted were not comparable.
Santa Clara, California-based Intel noted that the verdict was the second largest by a jury in a patent case, and that the three other largest verdicts had been vacated.
A different Waco jury ruled in Intel's favor on April 21 in a separate patent infringement lawsuit in which VLSI had sought $3.1 billion.

By William Hoffman
NEW YORK , Aug 10 (IFR) - Intel returned to the US investment grade corporate bond primary Tuesday with a US$5bn five-part trade that served as a test of the company's new roadmap to retake its number one position in the industry after a tumultuous year.
The chipmaker has fallen behind some of the innovations coming from its competitors in the space, which led to the loss of its biggest customer last year when iPhone maker Apple decided to make its own chips internally for all its new computers, phones and tablets. 
In February, the company named Pat Gelsinger as its new chief executive officer as it attempts to right the ship amid a chip shortage that shows the product is more popular than ever. In late July, the company held a virtual presentation and Q&A called ""Intel Accelerated,"" which laid out a plan to once again produce the fastest chips in the industry by 2025.
Tuesday's bond deal is the company's first since a US$8bn trade in March 2020 and the first test of investor's appetite for new debt from Intel since it lost the Apple business and embarked on this new plan.  
Intel, rated A1/A+, is the largest deal on another busy day in the asset class as 16 borrowers collectively raised US$20.1bn. Tuesday's surge of deals follows on from 15 borrowers that raised US$16.9bn on Monday for a two day total of US$37.1bn. 
The semiconductor company launched a US$1bn seven-year at 50bp over Treasuries, a US$1.25bn 10-year at 65bp over, a US$750m 20-year at 90bp over, a US$1.25bn 30-year at 105bp over and a US$750m 40-year at 120bp over. Spreads tightened by 25bp from initial price thoughts were set in the area of Treasuries plus 75bp, 90bp, 115bp, 130bp and 145bp.
At those levels, bookrunners Bank of America, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan left little to no concessions when compared with its 3.9% March 2030 that was last trading at a G spread of around 67bp, according to MarketAxess data. 
Proceeds are set to be used for general corporate purposes including refinancing of outstanding debt, which includes more than US$6.4bn of debt coming due this year and next, according to Refinitiv data. 
Still, Intel exited the second quarter with nearly US$25bn of cash and equivalents on the balance sheet, so analysts at research firm CreditSights see this new deal as an opportunistic deal to take advantage of the strong funding environment. 
""Intel’s capex needs are ramping with the company pouring more investment dollars into leading-edge process technology development and infrastructure to support its foundry initiative,"" CreditSights noted in a report. 
Additionally, rumors have surfaced that Intel could look to acquire the US semiconductor manufacturer GlobalFoundries in a deal valued at around US$30bn. However, analysts at CreditSights and elsewhere have questioned how advantageous that move would be for Intel's foundry services business since GlobalFoundries halted its more advanced 7-nano-meter chip production back in 2018.
""At this point, we would not say that M&A is critical but nor would we rule it out – our view is that industry consolidation is very likely,"" Gelsinger said. ""The intense R&D, the need to move to modern and leading-edge nodes, the massive capital investments required, we just simply view that smaller players simply won't be able to keep up, and foundries without leading edge capabilities will be left behind. We're continually seeking ways to accelerate our plans with IFS. If an acquisition can help, we will certainly not rule it out.""

2021-08-10 00:00:00+00:00,"After 5% Rise In A Week, What's Next For Nvidia Stock?",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/after-5-rise-in-a-week-whats-next-for-nvidia-stock-2021-08-10,,,"Nvidia stock (NASDAQ: NVDA) has seen an impressive rise of 5% over the past week and currently trades at $206 per share. This rally was driven by expectations of strong earnings growth in the company’s upcoming Q2 2022 results, expected later this month. For Q1 2022, Nvidia posted stellar revenue growth, with revenue rising to $5.66 billion from $3.08 billion in Q1 2021, which helped drive the company’s net income to $1.91 billion from $917 million over this period. The strong jump in earnings came due to a combination of shrewd expense control and a slightly lower effective tax rate.
After the recent rally, will Nvidia stock continue its upward trajectory over the coming weeks, or is a correction in the stock more likely? According to the Trefis Machine Learning Engine, which identifies trends in a company’s stock price data for the last ten years, returns for Nvidia stock average close to 2.1% in the next one-month (21 trading days) period after experiencing a 5% rise over the previous one week (five trading days) period. But how would these numbers change if you are interested in holding Nvidia stock for a shorter or a longer time period? You can test the answer and many other combinations on the Trefis Machine Learning Engine to test Nvidia stock chances of a rise after a fall and vice versa. You can test the chance of recovery over different time intervals of a quarter, month, or even just one day!
MACHINE LEARNING ENGINE – try it yourself:
IF Nvidia stock moved by -5% over five trading days, THEN over the next 21 trading days, Nvidia stock moves an average of 4.6 percent, with a strong 66.3% probability of a positive return.
Some Fun Scenarios, FAQs & Making Sense of Nvidia Stock Movements:
Question 1: Is the average return for Nvidia stock higher after a drop?
Answer:
Consider two situations,
Case 1: Nvidia stock drops by -5% or more in a week
Case 2: Nvidia stock rises by 5% or more in a week
Is the average return for Nvidia stock higher over the subsequent month after Case 1 or Case 2?
Nvidia stock fares better after Case 1, with an average return of 4.5% over the next month (21 trading days) under Case 1 (where the stock has just suffered a 5% loss over the previous week), versus, an average return of 2.1% for Case 2.
In comparison, the S&P 500 has an average return of 3.1% over the next 21 trading days under Case 1, and an average return of just 0.5% for Case 2 as detailed in our dashboard that details the average return for the S&P 500 after a fall or rise.
Try the Trefis machine learning engine above to see for yourself how Nvidia stock is likely to behave after any specific gain or loss over a period.
Question 2: Does patience pay?
Answer:
If you buy and hold Nvidia stock, the expectation is over time the near-term fluctuations will cancel out, and the long-term positive trend will favor you – at least if the company is otherwise strong.
Overall, according to data and Trefis machine learning engine’s calculations, patience absolutely pays for most stocks!
For Nvidia stock, the returns over the next N days after a -5% change over the last five trading days is detailed in the table below, along with the returns for the S&P500:
Question 3: What about the average return after a rise if you wait for a while?
Answer:
The average return after a rise is understandably lower than after a fall as detailed in the previous question. Interestingly, though, if a stock has gained over the last few days, you would do better to avoid short-term bets for most stocks.
Nvidia’s returns over the next N days after a 5% change over the last five trading days is detailed in the table below, along with the returns for the S&P500:
It’s pretty powerful to test the trend for yourself for Nvidia stock by changing the inputs in the charts above.

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.

2021-08-09 00:00:00+00:00,3 5G Stocks to Buy in August,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-5g-stocks-to-buy-in-august-2021-08-09,,,"The rollout of 5G communications may seem overhyped, but it's really a big deal. Not only will lightning-fast, low-latency wireless communications become a new standard and speed up economic activity, but 5G will also open the door to a host of new killer apps, from virtual reality, to highly automated factories and farms, to other ways we may not have even contemplated yet.
The buildout of 5G is just beginning in earnest today, with the first 5G iPhone introduced one year ago. Yet because of the difficulty of 5G deployments, the rollout will take a few years, with the benefits kicking in gradually. That's why the three companies leading this revolution -- T-Mobile (NASDAQ: TMUS), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM), and Micron Technology (NASDAQ: MU) --will see compounding benefits this decade.
Even better? Each stock looks reasonably priced today.
T-Mobile has a two-year head-start in 5G deployment. Image source: Getty Images.
T-Mobile has a two-year lead in 5G deployment
Thanks to its 2020 acquisition of Sprint and other smart spectrum investments over the years, ""Un-Carrier"" T-Mobile has a solid lead in 5G deployment. In fact, seven recent independent third-party reports clarified that T-Mobile has the superior 5G network -- a big contrast from the 4G era, when it was a laggard.
T-Mobile's stock didn't do much of anything after its latest earnings report. Strong net additions, a beat on revenues and profits, and raised guidance for the year were offset by news that Dish Network (NASDAQ: DISH), will move off T-Mobile's wholesale network for AT&T's (NYSE: T). That move will put a near-term hole in T-Mobile's financials, to the tune of over $500 million in revenue per year. Yet despite this small setback, CEO Mike Sievert reiterated the company's impressive medium and long-term guidance outlined in its analyst day back in March, on the conference call with analysts.
The loss of Dish will also free up capacity on T-Mobile's network, which the company will turn around and aggressively market to its three main growth targets: enterprises, rural areas, and home 5G broadband. Each of those segments represents a tremendous growth opportunity for the company.
T-Mobile plans to cover 200 million points-of-presence (POPs) with its ultra-capacity midband 5G spectrum by the end of 2021, a target competitors won't be able to reach until the end of 2023, and T-Mobile will continue to cement its lead with more capacity and 300 million midband POPs by that time.
As more people get 5G phones and the capabilities of 5G become clearer, it appears T-Mobile will continue to benefit from its lead. The current consolidation in the stock therefore looks like a good opportunity to pick up shares in this 5G leader.

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing is also leading the pack in foundries
The world's largest and most capable semiconductor foundry will also benefit handsomely in the 5G era. 5G requires more advanced leading-edge chips, and Taiwan Semi now has a multiyear lead over rivals in pulling off the most exacting, complicated semiconductor manufacturing processes.
Since it pulled ahead of rival Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) on the leading edge several years ago, TSM's stock has rallied; however, TSM's stock is actually down about 18% off its all-time highs. The culprit could be the massive spending plans announced by rivals Samsung and Intel, which intend to catch up to TSM and build their own third-party foundry capabilities over the next several years. And while TSM posted strong 28% revenue growth last quarter, margins slipped, perhaps also dampening enthusiasm.
However, TSM has announced its own $100 billion spending plan over the next three years to satisfy booming demand and cement its industry-leading position. The U.S. government is also subsidizing TSM to build capacity in Arizona, because of its clear manufacturing lead.
In addition, margin compression was due to foreign exchange fluctuations, plus the faster ramp-up of the leading-edge 5-nanometer node. When a new node ramps, its margins are lower, but they expand as production matures. So neither of the reasons for the margin compression are really causes for concern.
Meanwhile, the long-term picture is exceptionally bullish. Management said it now expects to grow revenue at the high end of its 10%-15% five-year annualized growth rate -- and even that is probably conservative. Also encouraging, CEO C.C. Wei claimed that any sort of future semiconductor industry slowdown is likely to be less severe than in the past, because of the dual 5G and artificial-intelligence megatrends likely to grow every year this decade.
With the stock trading around 30 times earnings, and with its 1.5% dividend sure to grow over the next five years and beyond, now looks like a good time to add to this 5G leader.

Micron introduces a dividend, in a show of confidence
Finally, all 5G phones, networks, and applications will require much more data and firepower than those of the 4G era. That means an era of heightened demand both DRAM memory and NAND flash storage. As one of only three major DRAM producers and about six NAND flash producers, Micron should be able to generate hefty profits in the 2020s.
The solid outlook for memory and storage recently encouraged Micron to initiate a small dividend of $0.10 per quarter, or about a 0.5% dividend yield at today's stock price. That relatively small dividend may not seem like much, but this pleasant surprise for investors could be pretty significant in terms of what it signals. The memory industry has historically been prone to booms and busts, but the initiation of a dividend shows confidence that Micron will be able to generate solid profits through future cycles -- a stark contrast from the 2000s and 2010s.
Management's confidence is due to the combination of improved demand for memory, thanks to 5G, AI, and the Internet of Things. Meanwhile, on the supply side, industry consolidation has helped the remaining players focus on generating returns on investment, rather than endless price and market share wars. In addition, under CEO Sanjay Mehrotra, Micron itself has greatly improved relative to its competitors, introducing the industry's first 1-alpha DRAM node and first 176-layer NAND flash chip during the past year.
The small dividend also still leaves plenty of cash left over for stock buybacks, which the company will continue. CFO David Zinsner said the company will take a more opportunistic approach to buybacks, conserving cash when the stock price is high, but being more aggressive when it is low. Given the higher-than-normal volatility in Micron's stock price -- which is nearly 20% below its recent all-time highs -- that seems like a prudent strategy.
If management's sunny outlook is to be believed, and memory cycles become more muted and profitable over time, Micron's shares look extremely cheap, at just 7.6 times next year's earnings estimates. If the strong semi market continues into 2022, those earnings estimates may end up being conservative too.

WASHINGTON, Aug 6 (Reuters) - A group of 14 Republican lawmakers in the U.S. House of Representatives on Friday asked the U.S. Commerce Department to add former Huawei HWT.UL unit Honor Device Co to the government's economic blacklist.
The lawmakers led by Republican Michael McCaul, the ranking member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, noted in a letter that Honor was divested from Huawei, which was added to the U.S. Entity List in May 2019. Being added to that list bans companies from buying parts and components from U.S. companies or using American technology without U.S. government approval.
The Republican lawmakers argued that Honor was spun off ""in an effort to evade U.S. export control policies meant to keep U.S. technology and software out of the hands of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).""
The letter cited analysts saying that ""selling Honor gave it access to the semiconductor chips and software it relied on and would have presumably been blocked had the divestiture not gone through.""
The U.S. Commerce Department and the Chinese Embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Honor and Huawei did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Huawei in November 2020 said it was selling its budget brand smartphone unit, Honor, to a consortium of over 30 agents and dealers.
Reuters reported in January the all-cash sale fetched more than 100 billion yuan ($15.5 billion) and was aimed at keeping the budget brand alive, ""as sanctions slapped on Huawei by the United States had hampered the unit’s supply chain and cut off the company’s access to key hardware like chips and software.""
Washington says Huawei is a national security threat, which Huawei has repeatedly denied.
In January, Honor said it had formed partnerships with chip makers such as Intel Corp INTC.O and Qualcomm Inc QCOM.O and launched a new phone.
The lawmakers said ""the same concerns about technology exports to Honor when it was part of Huawei should apply under its current state-backed ownership structure.""

But here's an alternative: semiconductor stocks. Semiconductors are the basic building blocks of all technology, and they're gobbling up supplier share of the auto industry. According to estimates, electronic components went from 22% of the cost to produce a car in 2000 to 35% in 2010, to about 40% today -- and could be a whopping 50% by the end of this decade.
Clearly, the already well-established but still fast-growing semiconductor industry is a great way to bet on EVs and other auto tech without needing to pick which automaker will be the biggest winner. Three chip stocks to consider are NXP Semiconductors (NASDAQ: NXPI), Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ: SWKS), and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM).

NXP: A top supplier for auto parts
NXP Semiconductors is one of the most focused electronics suppliers to the auto industry. In fact, during its last quarter, it reported that 49% of its sales went to automakers, and that segment boomed 87% year-over-year.
Granted, the big boost to NXP's auto business can be attributed to automakers being on lockdown last spring when the pandemic started. With vehicles rolling off assembly lines in droves to keep up with booming demand this year, it's no wonder NXP is getting a lift from the industry. However, this is more than a one-off story.
As was already discussed, technology is eating up a growing share of the cost to produce a vehicle, and NXP is at the forefront of this movement. It provides all sorts of circuitry that goes into modern car or truck production, from powertrain electrification to in-car connectivity to the infotainment system. And the company is constantly improving its hardware designs, as well as its manufacturing capabilities (including three fabs here in the States), to better support its customers.
During Q2 2021, NXP said revenue and adjusted operating income grew a respective 43% and 121% year-over-year, driven primarily by autos. For Q3, it expects revenue to advance another 22% to 29% year-over-year, with profit margins staying even with Q2 levels or slightly improving. The stock trades at a modest 26 times trailing 12-month free cash flow after the last report. NXP also sweetens the deal with a 1.1% dividend yield and returns additional cash via share repurchases. Given the long-term growth opportunity this top automotive supplier has ahead of it, it looks like a top chip stock buy right now.
Skyworks Solutions: Betting on new auto tech via acquisition
Skyworks Solutions is a connectivity chip designer, best known for providing radio frequency components and related circuitry for Apple and other smartphone makers. This has been a hot market for Skyworks as of late, and it's cranking out 5G network chips so consumers can connect to the next-gen network.
But Skyworks has been developing its business outside of smartphones as well, expanding into areas it labels ""broad markets"" such as Wi-Fi connectivity, smart audio, and industrial and automotive chips. Broad markets grew 50% year-over-year in the last quarter, and they make up about one-third of Skyworks' total sales.
And the segment is about to get a big boost. Skyworks just completed the acquisition of Silicon Labs' (NASDAQ: SLAB) infrastructure and automotive business for $2.75 billion. This breaks ground on several new fronts for the connectivity chip leader, including EVs and the auto industry at large. Included in the infrastructure and automotive business are motor control components, power supply management, and connectivity infrastructure (which also goes into modern vehicle design to help various systems of the car communicate with each other). This puts Skyworks on the EV industry map in a potentially big way, with a robust portfolio of products for many automakers' electronics needs.
Skyworks is growing fast and generating ample profitability, with 36% adjusted operating margins in the last quarter. Shares yield a 1.2% dividend and trade for 28 times trailing 12-month free cash flow, a real long-term value given the multiple growth levers the company has on its hands in the decade ahead.
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing: The world's largest and most advanced chip fabricator
When it comes to semiconductor giants, look no further than Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM). The company churned out an incredible $48 billion in sales over the last year (though it still trails behind Intel's industry-leading $78 billion in sales), and is still growing at a swift pace (Intel, not so much).
TSM has the most advanced chip manufacturing capabilities around. Its 7- and 5-nanometer technology foundries (making the smallest, most energy-efficient designs out there) represented half of all revenue in Q2 2021. As auto technology advances and needs become increasingly complex (for EV powertrains, advanced safety and self-driving systems, in-car connectivity, etc.), TSM's automotive end-markets will grow. In fact, management chalked up last quarter's year-over-year growth of 20% to the high-end computing and automotive divisions.
Though it's handily in the lead on the chip fab front, TSM isn't resting on its laurels. The company's 4- and 3-nanometer chip foundries are on track to fire up in 2022, representing even more compact and power-efficient semiconductor designs that will eventually lead to more advanced auto capabilities -- all while eating up less battery capacity. For EV makers, increasing vehicle range on a charge is a critical part of winning the battle for consumer attention, so the auto industry certainly has a vested interest in TSM's improving prowess at building more power-efficient silicon.
TSM stock trades at an elevated price to free cash flow metric of 65 times trailing 12-month results. In part, that's because the company is lapping last year's depressed earnings during the first round of economic lockdowns, and it's also spending at an elevated rate right now to bring extra fabrication capacity online (like a new facility in Arizona). But this metric will improve in the coming quarters as TSM steadily grows, and a dividend currently yielding 1.5% doesn't hurt. This semiconductor industry leader is flush with net cash and has a clear roadmap to further expand in the EV market and other related technologies in the decade ahead.

In-line with my previous, bullish assessments of Nokia (NYSE:NOK), the company recently reported very strong second-quarter results. As a result, NOK stock is close to reaching its  highest levels in over five years.

I remain upbeat on Nokia’s new chips,  the company’s CEO, who was hired last August,  and its opportunities. I’m also impressed by other new products that it’s launched and by some of its achievements last quarter, as well as by its overall Q2 results
As a result of these points, as well as the valuation of NOK stock, which remains very reasonable,  I continue to recommend that relatively conservative growth and value investors buy the shares.
Nokia Reported Strong Q2 Results
Nokia reported Q2 earnings per share, excluding some items, of 0.09 EUR, which was in-line with analysts’ average estimate. In Q2 of 2020, Nokia generated just 0.02 EUR of EPS.

7 Coronavirus Stocks to Buy as the Delta Variant Rises
Last quarter, its net sales came in at 5.3 billion EUR, up 4% versus the same period a year earlier. Analysts’  average, estimate was 5.16 billion EUR.  Meanwhile, Nokia’s operating profit surged 61% year-over-year to 682 million EUR. Finally, it raised its 2021 net sales guidance to 21.7 billion EUR-22.7 billion EUR from 20.6 billion EUR -21.8 billion EUR previously.
Also importantly,  Nokia’s selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) expenses fell 1% YOY to 585 million EUR last quarter, while its return on invested capital jumped seven percentage points YOY to 18.4% from 11.4%.
New Chip, Cost Cutting Gave Nokia a Boost
In a previous article, I noted that Nokia was in the midst of changing the chips that power its 5G offerings ” from Field Programmable Gate Arrays or FPGAs, which are very expensive, large, and energy-intensive, to cheaper, much more efficient SoCs.” Nokia calls its new 5G chipset — which it developed in partnership with Broadcom (NASDAQ:BRCM), Marvell (NASDAQ:MRVL), and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) — ReefShark.
According to Nokia, ReefShark extensively utilizes AI, and Light Reading reported in March that ReefShark carries higher margins than the FPGAs that the company had previously used.
Encouragingly, during the company’s Q2 earnings conference call, its CEO, Pekka Lundmark, reported that it had successfully launched a number of new systems that utilize ReefShark, including “new AirScale Radio and Baseband product platforms,” which were launched in June, MIMO Active Antenna radios, and 8T8R radios. Lundmark added that, by the end of 2021, Nokia anticipates that it will have “largely” caught up with its 5G infrastructure rivals in all the areas in which it had been lagging.
In Q2, 54% of Nokia’s product shipped with ReefShark chips, and Lundmark said that the company remained on track to ship 70% of its 5G products with those chips by the end of 2021.
Additionally, the CEO reported that its current baseband products are ” up to 75% more power efficient” than its previous offerings, while it now has the lightest MIMO active antenna in the sector.
The decline in the company’s SG&A spending, which came despite the sizeable increase in its revenue, shows that Lundmark is continuing to tighten the belt at Nokia, in accordance with my previous predictions. And the strong growth in Nokia’s ROIC shows that the company’s financial health and overall performance have improved under Lundmark’s leadership.
Other Signs of Progress
At the end of May, Nokia disclosed that T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) Netherlands had selected it “to deliver automated network and security operations.” The deal could lead to Nokia being selected to work on T-Mobile’s projects in other countries.
In July, Nokia received its first 5G deal in China, obtaining a 10% share of a contract from China Mobile and 4% of the roughly $6 billion that was spread over three deals from the Chinese telecom giant. In China, Nokia is benefiting from the fact that Sweden, decided to block Chinese telecom company Huawei from making deals in the Scandinavian country. One of Nokia’s top rivals, Ericsson (NASDAQ:ERIC), is based in Sweden.
Further, Lundmark reported that the company had signed two automotive licensing deals , including one with Daimler (OTC:DDAIF), last quarter. He suggested that, as vehicles become more connected, Nokia is likely to obtain more such contracts.
Finally, Cowen analyst Paul Silverstein wrote that Nokia was benefiting from “improving execution” and predicted that the tech company’s financial results should rebound further going forward. The analyst praised Lundmark’s performance and increased his price target on NOK stock to $8 from $5.
The Bottom Line on NOK Stock
With Lundmark turning around Nokia, the company’s technology improving,  5G continuing to proliferate, the automotive market heating up, and China looking more friendly to Nokia, the company’s financial results are bound to meaningfully improve going forward.
Despite these positive catalysts the shares still have a forward price-earnings ratio of less than 20, making them a good buy for conservative, value-oriented investors.

With the recent flurry of earnings beats among some of the biggest names in tech, tech stocks are taking center stage. After all, when it comes to growth, this part of the stock market remains an area of interest for investors. For the most part, this would be thanks to the industry’s laser focus on innovation and remaining relevant. Given the current state of the world, some would argue that the current interest in tech stocks could hold up. After all, the Delta variant of the coronavirus continues to ravage the globe today. In theory, popular stay-at-home names in the tech world would thrive should these market conditions persist.
Take Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Skillz (NYSE: SKLZ) for example. On one hand, consumers across the globe turn to Apple when it comes to handheld and home electronics. So much so that the company raked in total revenue of $81.43 billion in its latest quarterly report. Even now, the company is rumored to be working on a new iPhone that boasts a disappearing camera notch. On the other hand, companies like Skillz are using tech to keep the general public entertained from their homes. This would be the case as demand for the company’s social gaming services remains at a high. Evidently, Skillz saw its total revenue increase by 52% year-over-year in its recent quarter fiscal posted last week.
By and large, the applications for tech in our world today continue to expand. With this expansion comes more opportunities than ever for investors to bet on the tech industry now. Could one of these tech stocks be top picks in the stock market today?

Microsoft Corporation
When it comes to tech, the Microsoft Corporation is a notable player in the industry today. Rightfully so as the company holds leading positions in many notable tech-based markets right now. This is apparent from the company’s world-class software offerings such as its Windows operating system and Microsoft Office productivity software. Across the board, Microsoft caters to the needs of both consumers and enterprises with its massive tech portfolio. Given the versatility and scale of the company’s offerings, would MSFT stock be worth watching now?
Notably, the company’s shares currently trade at $289.52 a stock as of the end of Thursday’s trading session. Even as it continues to trade towards newer heights, Microsoft seems to be kicking into high gear. In an official tweet posted yesterday, the company revealed that it has “reached capacity” for its Windows 365 trials. Despite only launching its new cloud PC service earlier this week, there seems to be an immense demand for it.
For the uninitiated, Windows 365 gives organizations access to virtual cloud-based PCs that run on Microsoft’s Windows operating system. In practice, this would allow employees to run Windows-based work applications from non-Windows devices. Safe to say, this groundbreaking innovation on Microsoft’s part appears to be a hit. Would all this make MSFT stock a top buy for you?

2021-08-05 00:00:00+00:00,3 Underrated Tech Dividend Stocks You Shouldn't Ignore,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-underrated-tech-dividend-stocks-you-shouldnt-ignore-2021-08-05,,,"Investing has significantly changed in the last 20 years. At the turn of the century, technology was considered a speculative investment sector while banks were the reliable blue-chip stocks. Coming out of the dot-com bubble, very few people would have guessed that 20 years later the five largest companies in the U.S. would all be technology companies.
It could be because of this still-common belief that many income investors seem to ignore the tech sector -- to their own detriment. Granted, technology companies are not known for high dividend yields, but their cash-flow-rich business models have supported years of dividend increases.
Let's take a closer look at three tech companies that should get more love from dividend investors.
Image source: Getty Images.
1. Microsoft's dividend is built to last
Investors can credit Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) for leading tech's dividend revolution. In 2004, the company was ""awash"" in cash, according to The Wall Street Journal, and paid out the split-adjusted per-share equivalent of $0.32 per year. That figure is now $2.24, and Microsoft has doubled the payout in the last seven years.
Microsoft is overlooked by dividend investors due to its lower yield. This is because the share price continues to outpace dividend increases as the stock has been on fire under CEO Satya Nadella. The dividend has doubled since 2014, but the stock has returned 683% since Nadella took the reins in February of that year. As a result, the dividend currently yields 0.80%, less than the greater S&P 500.
However, very few companies are primed for dividend increases like Microsoft. In addition to the company's dominance in PC operating systems, Nadella transitioned the company to next-gen applications like cloud computing and artificial intelligence. Now Microsoft's Azure is the top challenger to Amazon's cloud computing dominance. In the recent fourth quarter, revenue attributable to Azure grew 51% over the prior year.
2. Apple is returning cash on a massive scale
It's been widely reported that Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) founder and former CEO Steve Jobs wasn't exactly shareholder-focused. Notoriously known as a product guru, Jobs focused most of his efforts on the end user's experience and less on stock performance or dividends.
Therefore, it was no surprise that Apple didn't pay a dividend when Jobs returned to the CEO role to turn around the company he was once pushed out of. While the attention to product development remains, current CEO Tim Cook has also put some effort into returning cash to shareholders. The company reestablished the dividend in 2012.
The payout at that time was $0.38 per share (split adjusted). Now the payout is $0.88 per share, more than doubling in nine years. Additionally, the company continues to buy back shares at a rapid pace, spending nearly $450 billion on buybacks since fiscal 2012.
The knock against Apple is the company is a hardware manufacturer and deserves lower valuations as the smartphone market becomes saturated. That's a false narrative, as Apple is now focusing on monetizing its massive installed base with higher-margin services.
The company reported an annualized run rate of $70 billion for its services as of the last quarter. If Apple's services were a stand-alone company, it would be No. 45 on the Fortune 500 list, ahead of FedEx. Look for Apple to continue returning cash to shareholders for decades to come.
3. Intel is a turnaround dividend pick
Once part of the dominant ""Wintel"" monopoly of the PC market (along with Microsoft), Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) stock has seen better days. Intel significantly underperformed the semiconductor index in the last five years, with the iShares Semiconductor ETF returning 350% versus 55% for Intel. Despite that, the company continues to raise its dividend, from the split-adjusted figure of $0.013 per year in 1992 to $1.39 per share today.
The vertically integrated chipmaker fell behind fabless chip design companies like Nvidia and AMD in the innovation race. Last year the company lost a long-standing deal with Apple to manufacture the chipsets powering Apple's Mac computers.
Intel reported a slight decline in revenue during the second quarter as demand for computers returned to normal. Despite the small decline, the company is guiding for $11 billion in free cash flow this year, more than enough to pay dividends of $5.6 billion.
The new CEO has an intriguing plan to turn around the ship. Intel is now becoming a third-party foundry, spending $20 billion to build two new foundries while announcing it will work alongside third-party fabless chip designers to manufacture their chips. While the company would prefer to win the design outright, chip manufacturing is becoming a matter of national security with the U.S. Senate approving $52 billion to boost domestic chip manufacturing (the bill has not yet been passed in the House or approved by the president). Intel is down, but certainly not out for dividend investors.

This article was originally published on Simply Wall St News
Investors have been debating what the projected decline of Intel Corporation's (NASDAQ:INTC) revenue means for the stock price, and how does the semiconductor crisis impact the chip market regarding Intel. When there are multiple factors at play, it is always good to see how much the company is worth, and get a better idea of what the stock might do in the future.
We will estimate the attractiveness of Intel as an investment opportunity by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model.
It's actually not too difficult to follow, as you'll see from our example!
We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model.
View our latest analysis for Intel
Crunching the numbers
We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows.
In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value.
We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.
A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:
10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate
2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031
Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$12.6b US$12.0b US$12.4b US$14.8b US$15.4b US$16.0b US$16.5b US$16.9b US$17.4b US$17.8b
Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x14 Analyst x4 Analyst x2 Analyst x2 Est @ 4.36% Est @ 3.65% Est @ 3.15% Est @ 2.8% Est @ 2.56% Est @ 2.39%
Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.8% US$11.7k US$10.4k US$9.9k US$10.9k US$10.6k US$10.2k US$9.7k US$9.3k US$8.8k US$8.4k
(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)
Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$100b
The second stage is also known as Terminal Stage.
This is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.0%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.8%.
Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2031 × (1 + g) ÷ (r * g) = US$18b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (7.8%* 2.0%) = US$313b
Present Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$313b÷ ( 1 + 7.8%)10= US$148b
The total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$248b.
The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding.
Relative to the current share price of US$53.9, the company appears about fair value at a 12% discount to where the stock price trades currently.
Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.
NasdaqGS:INTC Discounted Cash Flow August 5th 2021
The assumptions
We would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions.
The cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation, we've used 7.8%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.228. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.
Some Moving Parts
Intel is sticking to its strategy to have first-hand production of its chips, rather than outsourcing them to companies like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TWSE:2330). They will likely make some exceptions in the short term. 
Most of Intel's future business prospects are large scale and industrial, with a mix of cloud and electrical vehicle solutions. In their Q2 press release, they outline the following notable business highlights:
A US$3.5 billion investment to equip Intel’s New Mexico operations for the manufacturing of advanced semiconductors
Launched 12 new processors for clients
Announced partnership with Microsoft including Intel Bridge Technology to deliver better mobile experiences on Windows-powered PCs
Leading cloud service providers, including Alibaba, Baidu, Microsoft, and Oracle are offering services based on the latest 3rd Gen Intel® Xeon® Scalable (“Ice Lake”) processors
Announced partnership with Ericsson to increase 5G performance
Mobileye and ZF were selected by Toyota Motor Corp to develop advanced driver assistance systems.
Considering risks, the semiconductor industry is experiencing both a shortage and a takeover of marketshare from competitors like Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) with their new product lines and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TWSE:2330) as heavy capacity producers.
Conclusion & Next Steps
In putting together a DCF valuation Intel seems to be trading close to intrinsic value with some potential upside. The positive aspect is that the DCF model is based on a money making company which has great financial history and is in a stable phase.
Investors may want to consider putting Intel on their watch-list, as short term revenue downtrends have the propensity to spook some institutional investors and may leave room for long term investors.
Intel is a high margin, cash delivering business, that is positioned in a growing industry with strong barriers to entry.
Although the valuation of a company is important, it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Preferably, you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation.
For Intel, we've put together three relevant elements you should explore:

2021-08-05 00:00:00+00:00,Is It Time to Buy the Dow Jones' 3 Worst-Performing July Stocks?,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/is-it-time-to-buy-the-dow-jones-3-worst-performing-july-stocks-2021-08-05,,,"Like bargains? Sure you do. Why pay a higher price for something when you can purchase it at a lower price? The idea even applies to stocks.
Just because a stock is ""on sale"" by virtue of a lower price, however, it doesn't necessarily make it a buy. A lower-priced name is only a bargain if there's a reasonably good chance it's going to rebound better and faster than other stocks rise... even if these beaten-down stocks are the most reputable of blue chips.
With that as the backdrop, any bargain hunters eyeing last month's biggest pullbacks among constituents of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES: ^DJI) may want to think twice before stepping in. There's a suspicious common thread among these tumbles that suggests the dips were more than just a little volatility.
The party is over, the hangover begins
Good investors think about a company's fiscals and scour headlines about that organization. Great investors consider context and commonalities that nobody else notices. See, context and bigger-picture undertows ultimately drive most of the market's action.
To this end, while the Dow's biggest losers for July were a highly disparate Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ: WBA), Caterpillar (NYSE: CAT), and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), all three sell-offs have the same roots. That is, after topping last quarter's estimates, each of these Dow names offered guidance that was less than thrilling.
Image source: Getty Images.
You may recall the market's knee-jerk responses to Intel's Q2 reports and guidance. The company's top line of $19.6 billion led to per-share profits of $1.28, versus analysts' earnings estimates of $1.07 per share and revenue of $17.8 billion. Guidance for $18.2 billion worth of revenue for the quarter now underway -- and its corresponding earnings of $1.10 per share -- is also better than the current consensus.
The company's outlook for the full year, however, suggests profit margins will shrink through the remainder of 2021. Intel is responding to the chip shortage aggressively, but the stock's 4.3% slide in July says investors aren't thrilled with the fiscal way the response is taking shape.
Caterpillar's story is similar, if not identical. Shares of the earth-moving equipment maker sold off with its peers in mid-July on worries of a resurging COVID-19 pandemic. Then, just when it looked as if CAT stock might claw its way back to bullish mode, the company cautioned that increasing materials and delivery costs ahead would be difficult to pass along to customers following two price hikes already put into place earlier this year. End result? A 5% setback last month, a big piece of which took shape in response to Caterpillar's acknowledgement that its profit margins would be pressured in the foreseeable future as well.
And Walgreens? It led the way lower last month with its 10.4% setback after not only topping Q2 estimates, but offering Q3 guidance that was better than expected. The market can't get past CFO James Kehoe's comment made during the Q2 conference call, though: ""We are expecting solid year-on-year EPS growth in the fourth quarter, although at a slower rate than the third quarter."" While the pandemic is still with us, the number of COVID-19 vaccines being administered has already peaked, crimping a key piece of the drugstore chain's recent revenue stream. Right or wrong, it upset investors.
^DJI data by YCharts
It's also worth mentioning that shares of Walgreens, Intel, and Caterpillar were among the Dow's biggest losers in June as well, suggesting the market innately knew the bullish arguments for these outfits was already weakening.
Do note that Dow component Boeing (NYSE: BA) tumbled 5.4% last month, but that's hardly news or noteworthy. Yet another technical concern with the 737 MAX as well as the spread of the new delta variant of COVID-19 are the key culprits of the setback. The aircraft maker's woes are real, but not surprising.
Read between the lines
Investors should take the collective warnings from these (and other) blue chip names seriously, as well as June's downtrends leading into these warnings.
Were it just one company saying the foreseeable future isn't quite so bright, it could be chalked up to sandbagging. When a bunch of blue chip companies are all pointing to similar fundamental and economic problems, though, it's a clue that something bigger is happening.
In this case, what's happening is a hangover following a stimulus-driven recovery from a recession prompted by the pandemic. It was fun while it lasted, but the next chapter isn't going to be as much fun now that we're facing strong inflation in an economy that's still not firing on all of its pre-pandemic cylinders.
None of this makes Walgreens, Intel, and Caterpillar poor companies, mind you. But it might be smart to steer clear of these Dow stocks until we stop hearing them voice the same worries about the economic environment.

2021-08-04 00:00:00+00:00,Tech Companies Are Facing a Global Chip Shortage: 5 Tips for Investors,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/tech-companies-are-facing-a-global-chip-shortage%3A-5-tips-for-investors-2021-08-04,,,"The global chip shortage started in 2018 and 2019 as escalating trade conflicts disrupted semiconductor supply chains, then worsened in 2020 as the pandemic exacerbated those disruptions. Many top chipmakers and analysts expect the ongoing crisis to last through 2023.
That shortage is generating tailwinds and headwinds for certain companies, but it can be tough for investors to tune out the noise and separate the winners from the losers. Let's examine five main aspects of the chip shortage -- and how they could affect certain sectors and stocks.
Image source: Getty Images.
1. Understand the secular tailwinds
Even if the trade war and pandemic didn't happen, the market's demand for chips would still be elevated today. New 5G devices, gaming consoles, connected and driverless cars, and Internet of Things (IoT) gadgets all require increasing numbers of more advanced chips. Data centers are also upgrading their servers to deal with the surging usage of cloud, machine learning, and artificial intelligence (AI) services.
However, the pandemic also accelerated sales of stay-at-home consumer electronics such as PCs and gaming consoles, while disrupting the available supply of chips. Those unexpected twists made it even tougher for chipmakers to keep up with the market's insatiable appetite for new chips.
2. Understand the geopolitical tensions
The tech war between the U.S. and China is causing headaches for many chipmakers. For example, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE: TSM), the world's top contract chipmaker, was forced to stop accepting orders from Huawei after the U.S. blacklisted the Chinese tech giant. U.S. chipmakers like Skyworks Solutions and Micron Technology were also forced to cut ties with Huawei.
That decoupling caused China to aggressively subsidize its domestic chipmakers, while its regulators threatened to delay big deals -- such as Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) planned purchase of Arm -- that benefit American chipmakers. Meanwhile, the U.S. has granted subsidies to TSMC to build new plants in Arizona, and will likely subsidize Intel's (NASDAQ: INTC) plans to expand its domestic foundries.
3. Understand the different types of chipmakers
Investors shouldn't touch any chip stocks until they understand the differences between integrated device manufacturers (IDMs), fabless chipmakers, chip designers, and third-party foundries.
IDMs design, manufacture, and sell their own chips. Intel, Skyworks, and Texas Instruments are all IDMs -- but Intel manufactures smaller and more complex chips than those other two chipmakers.
Fabless chipmakers design their own chips but outsource the production to third-party foundries. These chipmakers -- which include Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices, and Qualcomm -- adopt this model because it's become too expensive to mass produce advanced chips on their own.
Chip designers license their designs to other chipmakers instead of manufacturing any chips. The industry's most important chip designer is arguably Arm Holdings, which provides designs for most of the world's mobile chips. That's why Nvidia's planned takeover of Arm is so controversial.
Lastly, third-party foundries do the heavy lifting for fabless chipmakers. TSMC and Samsung are the world's two most advanced contract chipmakers -- but Intel is trying to catch up with aggressive investments in its third-party foundry services. These leading foundries represent bottlenecks in the semiconductor market, and the chip shortage won't be resolved until they expand their capacity.

4. Evaluate the revenue growth vs. the rising costs
The global chip shortage seems to make TSMC a great investment since it's a linchpin of the market, but investors should realize it needs to significantly boost its capex to expand its capacity while maintaining its lead in the ""process race"" of creating smaller and more advanced chips.
TSMC plans to boost its capex from $17.2 billion in 2020 to approximately $30 billion this year, then collectively spend roughly $100 billion on its expansion over the next three years. Investors should weigh those rising costs against its projected revenue growth to see if the stock is worth buying. They should also view Intel and Samsung (which isn't available on U.S. exchanges) through the same lens.
Investors should also see where all that spending is going. One of those top beneficiaries is ASML Holding (NASDAQ: ASML), the Dutch semiconductor equipment maker that has monopolized the entire market for high-end EUV (extreme ultraviolet) systems -- which TSMC, Samsung, and Intel all need to manufacture their smallest and most advanced chips.
Therefore, it might make more sense to invest in ASML, another linchpin of the global semiconductor market, instead of other chipmakers as a long-term play on the ongoing chip shortage.
5. Understand which companies are affected the most
In addition to treading carefully with chipmakers and equipment makers during the shortage, investors should understand how the current bottlenecks could affect consumer-facing companies like Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Sony, and Nintendo. Apple expects the chip shortage to impact its iPhone shipments this year, while Sony and Nintendo expect those headwinds to throttle their shipments of PS5 and Switch consoles, respectively. The shortage is also disrupting the production of new vehicles.
Most of these companies should recover since there's plenty of pent-up demand for their products, but investors shouldn't ignore the near-term headwinds. Investors who want to profit from the shortage over the next two years should dive deeper into the semiconductor sector instead.

2021-08-03 00:00:00+00:00,FOCUS-Big strategic decisions await Samsung's Lee as momentum builds for his parole,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/focus-big-strategic-decisions-await-samsungs-lee-as-momentum-builds-for-his-parole-2021-08,,,"By Joyce Lee and Heekyong Yang
SEOUL, Aug 4 (Reuters) - With bated breath, management at Samsung Electronics 005930.KS is waiting to see if the conglomerate's leader, Jay Y. Lee, will be released on parole this month.
Support for his parole, both political and amongst the public, has grown amid anxiety that key strategic decisions are not being made at the South Korean tech giant.
If he is released, Samsung would be able to move forward with major investment and M&A projects - decisions company sources say should only be made by Lee who has been unable to address them while he sits in jail convicted of bribery and embezzlement.
In particular, a decision on the location of a $17 billion U.S. plant to produce advanced logic chips awaits his return, four Samsung sources told Reuters on condition of anonymity.
""The word is that the U.S. investment will be finalised when Vice Chairman Jay Y. Lee is back,"" said one of the people.
Kinam Kim, head of chips and components at Samsung and one of the firm's three co-CEOs, made a rare direct appeal to President Moon Jae-in in June, arguing Lee's return was crucial.
""Semiconductors need large investment decisions and the decisions can only be made quickly when the head of the conglomerate is present,"" Moon's office quoted Kim as saying.
Lee served one year of an initial 5-year sentence from August 2017 which was later suspended. That court decision was overturned and the sentence revised to 30 months, putting him back in jail in January this year. Having served some 18 months, he has just become eligible for release.
The Justice Ministry last month eased parole eligibility guidelines for first-time offenders with good behaviour like Lee to 60% of sentence term served. The average eligible time for all criminals in South Korea was 80% prior to the easing.
Lee's parole is expected to be reviewed on Aug. 9, and within Samsung hopes are high that he will be freed around Aug. 15 when the country celebrates Independence Day and pardons have traditionally been issued, three of the Samsung sources said.
The Justice Ministry and Samsung declined to comment.
If paroled, Lee would need the Justice Minister to approve his return to work as the law bars persons from working for companies involved in certain convictions for five years. He is likely to get that, legal experts say, as the amount deemed embezzled has been repaid.
While there have been some protests against an early release for Lee and civic groups have voiced opposition, public support for his early release is at about 70%, according to two polls.
A parliamentary committee leader has also voiced his support while other members of the ruling party have visited Samsung's chip complex noting that Lee is eligible for parole.
Support on social media ranges from those who think he has already paid his dues while others fret that without Lee at the helm, South Korea's flagship conglomerate will fall behind competitors at a time when there is a global chip shortage and rivals like TSMC 2330.TW and Intel Corp INTC.O are making large investments.
CASH PILE AWAITS USE
South Korea's biggest conglomerates are still owned and controlled by their founding families and there is little precedence for handing over the reins to non-family members even when a senior family member has been jailed.
On one hand, Samsung's day-to-day operations have been little affected by Lee's stints in prison. Operating profit in the latest quarter surged 54% and while he was jailed in 2017, Samsung reported its second-largest annual profit of 53.6 trillion won ($46.6 billion).
But experts say Samsung's organisational structure makes it difficult for anyone besides Lee to sign off on strategic decisions that draw on cash pooled from its three main divisions - mobile, consumer electronics and chips.
""Realistically, risky strategic decisions like M&A, multibillion dollar deals, are left to the owner at Samsung,"" said Jaeyong Song, professor at Seoul National University and author of ""The Samsung Way"", a book about Samsung's management style.
""CEOs in Korea are more like chief operating officers in a way. They take care of the short-term profits, while the owner takes on long-term competitiveness because their tenure is for life.""
Analysts have also linked Lee's legal troubles to Samsung's huge pile of cash, which has swollen 57% over four years to stand at just under $100 billion as of end-June, noting it has not made a major acquisition since 2016.
Chief Financial Officer Choi Yoon-ho told an earnings briefing in January the increase was mainly due to Samsung's inability to ""execute meaningful M&A activities"".
In addition to the decision on the planned U.S. chip factory - which has come down to Austin, Texas which is widely seen as the favoured location, another area in Texas, New York or Arizona - Lee's return would likely trigger potential acquisitions of stakes in companies, analysts said.
NXP Semiconductors NV NXPI.O, a Dutch maker of automotive chips with a market value of about $58 billion, has often been cited by analysts as a good fit for Samsung's strategic needs and a likely target. NXP declined to comment.
Samsung SDI 006400.KS is considering an investment of at least $3.5 billion in the United States to produce batteries for electric vehicles, but a final decision will rest with a task force for the wider Samsung group and is unlikely to be made before the chip plant decision, one of the sources said.
