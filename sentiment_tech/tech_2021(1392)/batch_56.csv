2021-02-23 00:00:00+00:00,EXCLUSIVE-Starboard eyes cloud software firm Box board challenge - sources,MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/exclusive-starboard-eyes-cloud-software-firm-box-board-challenge-sources-2021-02-23,,,"By Greg Roumeliotis
Feb 23 (Reuters) - Hedge fund Starboard Value LP is preparing to launch a board challenge against Box Inc BOX.N unless the U.S. cloud services provider takes steps to boost value for shareholders, according to people familiar with the matter.
Box has become an activist investor target after it failed to capitalize on the work-from-home trend during the COVID-19 pandemic as many of its cloud computing peers have done. Its shares have barely risen since the company's initial public offering six years ago, and are up just 9% in the last 12 months, underperforming the 33% rise in the S&P 500 Application Software index over the same period.
Starboard invested in the Redwood City, California-based company in 2019, and in March 2020 it agreed not to launch a board challenge that year in exchange for Box replacing three of its directors with three independent candidates.
Box also set up a board committee to identify opportunities to boost growth and improve margins. It embarked on a cost-cutting drive that boosted profitability, yet its revenue growth has been anemic as corporate customers turn to competitors such as Microsoft Corp MSFT.O, which offers its OneDrive data storage solution as part of its Teams collaboration platform at no additional cost.
Starboard wants Box to take more steps to reinvigorate revenue growth, as well as explore potential acquisition interest in the company from other technology firms and private equity firms, the sources said.
Three out of nine Box directors, including the company's co-founder and chief executive, Aaron Levie, are up for election at the company's annual shareholder meeting this spring, and Starboard is exploring putting forward candidates for all three seats if it does not see enough progress, the sources said.
The sources requested anonymity because the matter is confidential. Starboard declined to comment, while Box representatives did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Demand for secure file-sharing services online has skyrocketed since the onset of COVID-19, driven by the information technology needs of companies whose employees are working from home. While Box has benefited from this trend, it has struggled to fully capitalize on it, as some of its services and products are offered by competitors either for free or at a lower cost.
Box beat fiscal third-quarter sales expectations in December with an 11% year-on-year jump in revenue. Yet it gave guidance for revenue growth in 2021 of about 10% that was below most analysts' estimates. The company is scheduled to report earnings for its fiscal fourth quarter that ended Jan. 31 on March 2.
Starboard disclosed last month it had a 7.9% stake in Box. Led by hedge fund veteran Jeffrey Smith, it has pushed for changes at several technology companies, from chip makers Marvell Technology Group Ltd MRVL.O and ON Semiconductor Corp ON.O to cybersecurity firm NortonLifeLock Inc NLOK.O and internet services firm Yahoo Inc.
On Monday, a blank-check acquisition firm sponsored by Starboard agreed to take data center provider Cyxtera Technologies Inc public at a $3.4 billion valuation.

2021-02-17 00:00:00+00:00,Interesting MRVL Put And Call Options For May 21st,MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/interesting-mrvl-put-and-call-options-for-may-21st-2021-02-17,,,"Investors in Marvell Technology Group Ltd (Symbol: MRVL) saw new options become available this week, for the May 21st expiration. One of the key inputs that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 93 days until expiration the newly available contracts represent a possible opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the MRVL options chain for the new May 21st contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $50.00 strike price has a current bid of $4.35. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $50.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $45.65 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of MRVL, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $51.20/share today.
Because the $50.00 strike represents an approximate 2% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 59%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 8.70% return on the cash commitment, or 34.16% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Marvell Technology Group Ltd, and highlighting in green where the $50.00 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $60.00 strike price has a current bid of $2.56. If an investor was to purchase shares of MRVL stock at the current price level of $51.20/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $60.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 22.19% if the stock gets called away at the May 21st expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if MRVL shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Marvell Technology Group Ltd, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing MRVL's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $60.00 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $60.00 strike represents an approximate 17% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 68%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 5.00% boost of extra return to the investor, or 19.63% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.
The implied volatility in the put contract example is 54%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 58%.
Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $51.20) to be 53%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

The chief executives of major U.S. firms such as Intel Corp INTC.O, Qualcomm Inc QCOM.O, Micron Technology Inc MU.O and Advanced Micro Devices Inc AMD.O signed onto the letter.
It comes as a global chip shortage has idled factory lines at Ford Motor Co F.N and General Motors Co GM.N, with executives at the automakers predicting billions in lost profit. Tight chip supplies have even made it hard for consumers to buy popular gaming consoles such as Microsoft Corp's MSFT.O Xbox and Sony Corp's 6758.T Playstation.
The missing chips are mostly manufactured in countries such as Taiwan and Korea, which have come to dominate the industry. The letter, sent by the Semiconductor Industry Association, said that the U.S. share of semiconductor manufacturing dropped from 37% in 1990 to 12% today.
""This is largely because the governments of our global competitors offer significant incentives and subsidies to attract new semiconductor manufacturing facilities, while the U.S. does not,"" the group said.
Congress last year authorized subsidies for chip manufacturing and semiconductor research, but lawmakers must still decide how much funding to provide. The U.S. chip group urged Biden to provide such funding in the form of grants or tax credits.
""Working with Congress, your administration now has an historic opportunity to fund these initiatives to make them a reality,"" the chip group wrote. ""We believe bold action is needed to address the challenges we face. The costs of inaction are high.""

When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher — if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.
There are 17 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Marvell Technology Group Ltd, but the average is just that — a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $31.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $62.00. The standard deviation is $8.881.
But the whole reason to look at the average MRVL price target in the first place is to tap into a ""wisdom of crowds"" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with MRVL crossing above that average target price of $51.53/share, investors in MRVL have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $51.53 just one stop on the way to an even higher target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table?

5G is much more than an incremental next generation of cellular communication. 5G is kicking off one of the biggest waves of consumer smartphone upgrades in years. It’s also a key piece of many coming technological innovations, including autonomous vehicles. An investment in 5G stocks can pay off with real growth potential as infrastructure is built out and the technology is integrated into a wide range of products.
The Top 7 Hot Stocks to Buy for 2021’s Biggest Trends
I’ve put together a list of 5G stocks to keep your eye on this year. Each is positioned to benefit significantly as 5G adoption ramps up. And with Portfolio Grader rankings of “A” or “B” and market capitalizations ranging from $35 billion to $2.4 trillion, there’s a pick in here for any portfolio.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)
Analog Devices (NASDAQ:ADI)
Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO)

5G Stocks to Watch: Apple (AAPL)

Apple delivered monster first-quarter earnings this week. You’d be forgiven for not realizing that we’re in the midst of a pandemic that is still shuttering Apple retail stores, wreaking havoc with product shipments, and causing ongoing supply chain issues. Oh, and we’re in a recession with nearly 26 million Americans out of work — not ideal conditions for selling big-ticket consumer electronics. 
Despite all these challenges, Apple pulled off a record quarter. The company didn’t just pass $100 billion in earnings in the quarter for the first time, it blew past the mark with $111.4 billion. That’s up 21% year-over-year. AAPL’s Q1 obliterated Wall Street expectations. Revenue had been projected to be $103.28 billion, while earnings per share (EPS) of $1.68 was well above the $1.41 estimates.
One of the big catalysts for that monster quarter? That would be iPhone sales, which hit $65.6 billion. There have been predictions that the 5G iPhone 12 series would kick off an “upgrade super-cycle.” That seems to be happening. Apple CEO Tim Cook said the company saw more iPhone upgraders than in any previous quarter. With both the U.S. and China — Apple’s two largest markets — well into 5G network rollouts, look for iPhone upgraders to continue driving AAPL stock growth through 2021. 
Analog Devices (ADI)

An investment in Analog Devices is a bet on the continuing rollout of 5G network infrastructure. In particular, the company’s expertise in RF radio transceivers is in the spotlight. 
5G involves processing and transmitting vastly more data than 4G, but telecoms have limited space and power available in their cell towers. Analog Devices offers a solution for upgrading existing 4G sites to support the demands of 5G:
“[T]his technology integrates the complex, even unwieldy signal chain into a single microchip. By doing so, the challenges of size, power and cost in building 5G cell sites — all key practical barriers to adoption — become substantially more manageable.”
In December, Analog Devices announced a partnership with Marvell Technology (also on this list), for 4G/5G units that combine Analog Devices radios with Marvell Technology baseband silicon. The solution (with prototypes arriving later in 2021) will allow telecoms to transition cellular sites to higher capacity 5G at a lower capital cost.
7 Safe Stocks to Buy for Solid Returns in Tumultuous Times
ADI stock has posted gains of 35% over the past 12 months. Growing consumer adoption of 5G is only going to increase pressure on telecoms to expand coverage, keeping ADI’s growth going through 2021 and beyond. 
Broadcom (AVGO)

Broadcom is in the 5G infrastructure business, supplying system-on-chip (SoC) processors for 5G base stations. With an estimated five million 5G base stations expected to be shipped globally by 2024, winning any chunk of that market is good news for Broadcom shareholders.
However, Broadcom’s big win from 5G adoption is going to be in an area where it doesn’t actually offer a 5G solution. AVGO supplies a variety of key wireless chips to the smartphone industry, including WiFi and Bluetooth solutions. Apple happens to be one of the company’s largest clients. In 2019, the AAPL was estimated to account for 25% of Broadcom’s wireless chip business. In fact, rumors were floating that year that Apple might attempt to acquire Broadcom’s wireless chip business.
That acquisition never came to fruition. However, with consumers upgrading to 5G smartphones like Apple’s iPhone 12, Broadcom’s sales will also increase. Those sales are helping to power AVGO stock growth, which as been an impressive 50% over the past 12 months. 
Ericsson (ERIC)

Ericsson is a great play on 5G for investors because the Swedish telecommunications company has irons in both the consumer and telecom infrastructure fires.
Thanks to its patent portfolio, every time a company sells a 5G smartphone, Ericsson pockets about $5 in royalties. It’s estimated that by 2025, 5G smartphone royalties will be worth $20 billion globally, and ERIC will be one of three companies that snap up 90% of that.  
Ericsson is also in the top-three worldwide for 5G network deployments. At this point, the company has 127 commercial 5G agreements in place, with 79 live 5G networks using its technology.

ERIC stock has posted growth of 61% over the past year. With 5G smartphone sales taking off and 5G network rollouts continuing, Ericsson is definitely one of the 5G stocks to watch in 2021.
Marvell Technology (MRVL)

Semiconductor company Marvell Technology has been making big acquisition moves to bolster its 5G presence. It’s also partnering with other companies on 5G infrastructure solutions. These partnerships include teaming with Analog Devices on multi-antenna radio units and with Samsung on multi-radio access technology.
When reporting third-quarter revenue in December, Marvell Technology’s CEO told investors:
“Overall revenue increased 13% year on year, driven by our networking business, which grew revenue 35% year on year. Strong 5G and Cloud product ramps are fueling our ongoing success in these strategic growth markets.”
MRVL stock has more than doubled in value over the past 12 months. Its investment in 5G technology is expected to continue paying off as 5G rollouts continue across the globe. 
Qualcomm (QCOM)

Count Qualcomm among the chipmakers that are feeling the benefit of growing consumer demand for 5G smartphones. Qualcomm Snapdragon processors — with 5G chips — power most flagship Android smartphones. And thanks to a 2019 agreement, Qualcomm also supplies the 5G radios in Apple’s hot-selling iPhone 12. 
Long term, there are some potential clouds on the horizon. Samsung has been developing its own mobile processors with integrated 5G radios. China’s MediaTek has introduced 5G mobile processors aimed at lower-cost smartphones. And no one would be surprised if Apple switched to its own 5G modems for the iPhone once its current deal with Qualcomm expires in 2025.
9 Stocks Selling at a Discount Right Now
However, none of these issues is a near-term threat. With 12-month growth of 76%, QCOM stock is among the 5G stocks to watch in 2021. 
T-Mobile (TMUS)
Finally, a telecom that’s pulling ahead in the 5G race in the U.S. market. Since its merger with Sprint, T-Mobile has leapt to the forefront of 5G deployment. The company says its 5G service now covers 1.6 million square miles and 280 million people. Its higher speed Ultra Capacity 5G covers 106 million people in over 1,000 cities and towns.
It’s not just the coverage where TMUS is winning. Independent testing of 5G networks this month has shown T-Mobile has the fastest 5G download speed among major carriers, along with much higher 5G availability rates than the competition.  
That investment in 5G infrastructure appears to be paying off for T-Mobile. In its last quarter, the company reported record-high total net additions and total postpaid net additions, passing the 100-million-customer milestone. 
TMUS stock is up 62% over the past 12 months. That growth indicates that the merger with Sprint has paid off handsomely, while the company’s nation-leading next-gen cellular network makes it one of the big 5G stocks to keep your eye on through 2021.

This video was recorded on Jan. 19, 2021.
Chris Hill: It's Tuesday, Jan. 19. Welcome to MarketFoolery. I'm Chris Hill. With me today, Jason Moser in the house. Good to see you.
Jason Moser: Hey, you.
Hill: We have an acquisition. It's not Monday, but it feels like Merger Monday. [laughs] We're going to dip into the Fool Mailbag. We're going to start with another big bank though because Bank of America wrapped up their fiscal year with, let's just call it, a mixed fourth-quarter report. Profits were higher than expected for Bank of America. Overall revenue was a little light, but the stock is flat, which is pretty much in keeping with the past 12 months for shares of Bank of America.
Moser: Yeah. The financial sector in general didn't have the greatest 2020, that was one of the under-performing sectors of the year, understandably. It's been a difficult environment for all sorts of banks, both big and small. But even looking through the release, [laughs] it's a bit of a trick to really square this one up, because in the release, one of the points the CFO said, ""Despite one of the worst economic environments in modern memory,"" and you feel like right there, he's just setting us up for something. It's just not going to be very good. ""We ended the year stronger than before the health crisis and well-positioned to support our clients,"" and they go on to talk about having grown deposits by $361 billion, capital ratios are at record levels. They're back to returning capital to shareholders. Given that it is one of the worst [laughs] economic environments in modern memory, these guys seem to be doing OK. That's great. Maybe there is something to the liquidity that's been pumped through the system here over the past year, and that's for obvious reasons.
I think going into the core, a lot of the things that I have been focused on, and we talked about this last week, but generally speaking, just how they are feeling about the recession, generally speaking, how they're feeling about returning capital to shareholders, if there was any perspective on the political climate and reserves, I think what was really another big point. Into that point, reserves are going in the right direction. I mean, they were able to release $828 million of reserves. We've talked before about releasing those reserves and put those reserves aside in order to prepare themselves for a potential difficult climate of write-offs and bad loans. Well, it's maybe not as bad as one suspected, so they're able to release that reserve and that goes to the bottom line.
Also benefiting earnings, they saw expenses decline $474 million from the previous quarter on lower litigation costs. They actually saw that net interest income bump a little bit, which was nice to see even though it's really incremental at best. But I think, all things considered, we saw a lot of similarities with the other big banks that announced on Friday. Deposits are up phenomenally. I mean, just going back to that liquidity with some pump through the system here over the past year, deposits were at 23%. Loans on the other hand, down a couple of percent. They're contending with a little bit of a difficult environment in that regard, but they do see a good environment for deposits here this coming year, and that's banks are in the business of making money with that money so that all to set them up for decent success here, this coming year, and then back to the returning of capital to shareholders. I mean, they're able to get back to buying back shares, keep paying the dividends. I think that ultimately puts these guys in a pretty good spot.
Hill: When you look at Bank of America flat over the past year, does it look like a value opportunity right here?
Moser: I definitely can see, yes. I think that generally speaking with these banks, I feel like 2021 is shaping up to be a good year for most of these banks. I think a lot of that is because we should start to see some recovery. We should see that trend of releasing those reserves continue. At some point, I don't know if this is going to be anything we see really in 2021, but we might start hearing some talk about it at least. It is an improving interest rate environment which would then benefit their bottom line as well. Again, I think that's something we would probably hear about a little bit later on. But I think, given the performance of these banks in 2020, again, they were one of the underperforming sectors. I think that things are shaping up to look a lot better in 2021 than they did in 2020. It just goes to show that some of these banks are managed very well.
I think when we talk about CEOs in this space, Jamie Dimon is the name that always comes up to me at least as really the leader of the pack. I would put Brian Moynihan in there as maybe like a 1B. I think he's really, really good and he's been with Bank of America. I think since 2010 he's been running the show there. I think that the longer you have a leader in that type of position who just continues to do the things that he or she says they're going to do, I think that investors have to continue to look at that optimistically. Given the underperformance last year, I could see 2021 shaping up to be a better year for them, no doubt.
Hill: We have a deal in the laser industry, Lumentum is buying Coherent, a rival laser maker for $5.7 billion. This is a cash and stock deal. Wall Street is making it very clear what they think of this deal, shares of Lumentum down 10%, Coherent shares up more than 30%. Is Lumentum overpaying?
Moser: [laughs] Whenever you say the word Lumentum, immediately into my mind it just goes back to that inside joke, ask your doctor if Lumentum is right for you. I just want to get that out there.
Hill: It doesn't sound like a laser maker, it really does [laughs] sound like a pharmaceutical of some sort.
Moser: It sounds like a pharmaceutical you would see during a PGA broadcast or a football game, you're right. I totally agree with that. Every time I hear that, it's just the first place my mind goes. But yes, Lumentum is in the business of lasers among other things, and that's what this deal really is about. This is about getting Coherent's laser business. Lumentum is the company I've talked about on our show here a number of times. It's a company that I've recommended in my services. It's one that's just performed tremendously well over the past couple of years. I think a lot of that has to do with their leadership role in VCSEL, and that's vertical cavity surface emitting lasers. That's the central technology for these devices that we're getting into this whole world of sensors and 3D, imaging, in augmented reality, in virtual reality, stuff like that. VCSEL is an essential technology. For Lumentum as the leader in that space, they've seen a lot of success recently. Part of that is because they have a really big customer by the name of Apple, you probably have heard of it. Apple is responsible for about 26% up Lumentum's revenue. In 2020, it was responsible for 26% of Lumentum's total revenue.
They've been somewhat reliant on Apple, and that's OK because honestly, that technology is needed, but it is also a little bit of a risk. With Lumentum, they have two pieces to their business, the optical communications business, and that's where the VCSEL falls, and that is the overwhelming majority of the business. It's a little sliver of the business that really focuses on lasers though, and that's where this acquisition comes into play. It's a complementary deal in that regard. This is technology Lumentum didn't really have; Coherent, interesting little business that ain't dealing with COVID headwinds I think about as well as they could. It's a smaller company, but it is one that does most of its business outside of the U.S. About 76% of net sales in fiscal 2020 came from outside of the U.S. for Coherent. I do think that with this line of work, there's no question and you can see the benefits of scale, and we're seeing this play out. Look at some of these acquisitions that have been recently announced from all companies, big and small, you've got NVIDIA acquiring Arm, you get AMD acquiring Xilinx, you get Marvell acquiring Inphi, now you get Lumentum acquiring Coherent.
An interesting aspect to all of these deals is that they are part cash and part stock. These are not deals where the companies are just coming in and saying, ""All right, we're just going to make cash upfront."" I think it's just interesting to note that, because we talk a lot about these lofty market valuations right now, and that's true. That begets some lofty offers, like we're getting with this Coherent deal. But by the same token, these companies are at least using part stock to fund the deal. They're using a relatively cheap form of currency to do that. I think that's just something to keep in mind. It does make sense, I think, in today's environment to do that. I think that with the direction the world is headed, we talk about in microelectronics, we talk about lasers, we talked about VCSEL, and all of these different things this technology is doing. Lumentum and Coherent coming together, it seems like a very complementary deal. The reaction from the market today seems very much in line with the way it normally would react here. The burden of proof is on the acquirer. Understandably, Coherent shares are popping because of the offer. But all in all, as someone who covers Lumentum, I can see this deal working out as long as they are able to integrate it with minimal hiccups.
Hill: I should point out, and you touched on this, I mean, the 10% drop that we're seeing with Lumentum stock, this does come against the backdrop of a stock that over the last two years has doubled.
Moser: Yeah.
Hill: It's not like some deals, where we've seen the acquiring stock drop a little bit, and that's not the case where it's doubled in a short amount of time. I do wonder though, and this is another thing you touched on, I do wonder if we're just going to see a lot more deal making in 2021 than we did last year, in part because as you said, we've got cash and stock deals where the stock has run up, so it's a cheap currency. Also, it really doesn't seem like interest rates are going higher anytime soon.
Moser: No. I don't think they will. We might start hearing a little bit more of that conversation toward the end of this year. That remains to be seen. Even then, we're still looking at a situation where we will probably be witnessing low rates for quite some time. I think that really we're talking about Janet Yellen earlier and she seems to feel like, ""Hey, listen, this is the time right now where you got to go big."" Let's not just piecemeal this thing together. We're coming out of just one of the most brutal economic times here. COVID is obviously just ransacked the economy from a number of different perspectives. That does seem like at least her perspective is go-big or go home, and part of that going big is going to require interest rates to stay low for some stretch of time until they at least see some signs of inflation coming around. Even then, it remains to be seen exactly how they approach that. Yeah.
I do think that we are in a low-interest rate environment for some time to come. But yeah, it is nice to see, in a time like this, when companies have these valuations, that expands their balance sheet a little bit. It expands their capability of what they're able to do. Nothing's cheap in this market except for maybe banks. That's just something you've got to deal with. But at least on the flip side of that, they are able to use that form of cheap currency in shares, that as long as the acquisition makes sense, then maybe price isn't necessarily as big of a sticking point. Coherent, it's had its fair share of difficulty over the past year. But this is a company with some strong technologies, vertically integrated manufacturing. They do protect a lot of their intellectual property, and I think that's something that Lumentum is -- listen, they're good at what they do. I think they'll bring these guys in and make it work.
Hill: You can follow us on Twitter, @MarketFoolery is the show's handle. Question from Neal and Rockville, ""In light of calls for government action against big tech companies like Facebook, etc., if I use the QQQ to any person, 'spread the love', do I protect myself better by going with the QQQE? Thanks. I'll hang up and listen.""
Moser: Yes. [laughs]
Hill: Which I love that touch at the end. So thank you for that, Neal. For those unfamiliar, the QQQ is the NASDAQ 100. You can get that in ETF form, and it's basically, we're getting shares of the top 100 companies on the Nasdaq. If I understand this correctly, the QQQE is the NASDAQ 100, but it's equally weighted.
Moser: Yes.
Hill: I have right, where the QQQ is price-weighted?
Moser: Yes. You Q-ed in, I think I'm Q-ed in. You see what I did there? [laughs] That is the main difference there when you talk about these two ETFs. You've got the QQQ, which is market-cap-weighted, versus the QQQE, which is equally weighted, and so that's really just like it sounds. When a fund is market-cap-weighted, it's favoring those big companies more so than the small companies. In the equal weighting scenario, everything is given an equal weighting as it implies. It's not to say one is necessarily better than another, it is worth noting. If you look at the returns over the past three years, the QQQ total returns are up 93.5% and the QQQE total returns are up 70%. There is definitely some outperformance there, and that's understandable because of the market-cap-weighted index, it favors big tech and how big tech is really just been on such a tayar here over these past several years, and that's really the crux of this question is, is that tayar coming to an end? Is regulation such a threat that it could be a headwind for big tech here in the coming year two, three years, what have you?
That's a legitimate question. It really remains to be seen. I just don't know how far this new administration wants to push that. That really is the question to answer. I think when you look at investing in a market-cap-weighted portfolio because you're more concentrated in those big companies, if those big companies hit a wall or performance starts to really slow down, well, then you're going to see your returns reflect that. Whereas that QQQE, that equal weighting, you're going to be less exposed to those bigger companies if they do end up hitting a wall.
Listen, the math is there. You can see over the last several years that the market-cap-weighted ETF has been the way to go. But that doesn't mean that will always be the case. I think, either way, you're pretty well diversified. I tend to feel like this talk of regulation is a bit more bluster than anything else. I feel like they'll probably put these companies through a microscope and scrutinize and whatnot. I don't know that it really bet on any of them being broken up. It's difficult to see that at this point, the two phases out of the two. But anything can happen for sure. I think that either way, you're doing well, owning either one of these, but there's a question to be answered there in regard to regulation and that's just difficult to predict.
Hill: Our email address is MarketFoolery@fool.com; from Sebastian in Sweden. He writes, ""Love the podcast and hearing about U.S. stocks. However, it would be interesting to hear your take on the Swedish live casino provider, Evolution Gaming, that's kicking ass and taking over the world."" [laughs] I was unfamiliar with Evolution Gaming.
Moser: That makes two of us.
Hill: From a stock perspective, he's not wrong. This thing is up about 160% in the past year or so. I'm going to guess you're not overly familiar with Evolution Gaming, but prove me wrong. [laughs]
Moser: Not overly familiar with the company itself. Familiar with the general market, the general idea. We have a service called the Future of Entertainment where we focus on all sorts of different ways entertainment is dictating our lives and certainly sports betting and gambling and gaming are a part of that, and companies like Churchill Downs and Flutter Entertainment, those are companies that have made their way onto our radars. It looks like Evolution Gaming certainly should be one that is, because it is proving that they're on to something. Now, just to give you an idea of what Evolution actually does. They develop and they produce and market, and license live casino solutions for gaming operators. Then the gaming operators take that and they market those products. They offer those products to end-users, like you and me. Evolution's customers are actually these large online gaming operators, primarily in Europe and elsewhere around the world. The U.S. is part of it, but right now, that's really just a tiny part of their business.
I think part of their success has been the fact that it's such an international play. It's not something that's really hinging at success in the U.S. I understand the optimism there because it does feel like these floodgates are starting to open up in the U.S., which is going to give more opportunity for them to grow and they have grown. They've gone from €31 million in revenue in 2012 to $366 million in 2019. The growth is there, and clearly this pandemic has shown the value in digital-first businesses, and that's really what Evolution is. It's giving you the opportunity to participate in your favorite gaming or gambling, whether it's live roulette or monopoly live, or blackjack, or baccarat, or texas hold'em and whatever you want. They really do offer it, and it just essentially they run these games from their studio casinos, so to speak, and allow individuals to be able to participate via their favorite device, whether it's your phone or your laptop. Again, I think this represents a tremendous opportunity. I do understand the enthusiasm behind this name, and it's probably something that we should pay a little bit more attention to.

Chris Hill: Twilio CEO, Jeff Lawson, is our guest this week. As always, we've got a couple of stocks on our radar. But we begin with the big banks, Citigroup (NYSE: C), Wells Fargo (NYSE: WFC), and JP Morgan Chase (NYSE: JPM), all out with earnings reports on Friday morning. Jason, you host the Financials episode of our Industry Focus podcast every Monday, am I wrong or was JP Morgan's fourth quarter the most impressive of this group?
Jason Moser: No, you're definitely not wrong. I would agree with that. I mean, to me, there are the big banks and then there is JP Morgan, and it's the bank that stands out among the rest. I think that's for a few reasons. I think when you look at the banks in total, JP Morgan, Citigroup, Wells Fargo, they were all pretty good reports, relatively speaking. I think JP Morgan is the bank that has performed the best throughout the past several years because of leadership primarily. I think that Jamie Dimon, he's been the CEO of the company since 2006. He has always taken this philosophy of making sure that they are never caught essentially asleep at the wheel, so to speak.
There's a section on their earnings report called fortress principles. I mean, that just goes back to the idea that they're creating a balance sheet that will let them withstand any type of economic crisis. Clearly, they've been through a couple, at least. Wells Fargo, clearly a story of turnaround still. I think that going into this quarter, the thing that I was watching most was the status of all of the reserves that these banks have been putting aside here over the past several quarters based on the pandemic, the economic conditions that have come from what we've been going through. Going into this quarter, JP Morgan, for example, had set aside about $34 billion in reserves. So during this core, they were actually able to release close to $3 billion of those reserves and that's good. That's a sign that they believe things are getting better. I think they'll continue to slowly but surely release those reserves. Citigroup, very similar story. They're able to release $1.5 billion in reserves. Wells Fargo, this is still a turnaround story. I think they're doing the right things, but Mr. Scharf there has certainly been dealt a tougher deck. Anytime you get a turnaround of a company, it's difficult. Particularly when that turnaround is related to a relatively toxic culture. I think we could say that culture was toxic for a while. A lot of respect for what they're doing at Wells Fargo. They've still got a little ways to go, but all in all, I think these results portend a pretty good year for these banks to come here in 2021.
Hill: On our year-end review show a few weeks ago, Ron Gross said that 2020 was the year that the blockbuster IPO returned to Wall Street. That trend appears to have spilled over into 2021. Because this week, we saw a bunch of splashy IPOs, including shares of Poshmark rising more than 130% on its opening day, and Petco shares up 60% on its opening day. Emily, there were other IPOs, I'm curious. Based on what you've seen so far, what stands out to you?
Emily Flippen: It's funny because as an investor, I really didn't have a lot of fear about frothy IPOs until this week. I've made it through the entirety of 2020, but what really instilled fear into me as an investor is looking at Petco's IPO. Mostly because I looked at their S-1 when they filed it in late 2019, and it was amazing to me what a bad company this was. Sure. [laughs] Not to sugarcoat it, they are a turnaround story. [laughs] But even in fiscal year 2019, so pre-pandemic, this was a business that still produced more than $100 million in net losses. So, not a sustainably profitable business. It was a business that's highly indebted, owned by a PE firm, and has margins that are worse than their peers. By no means was this a business that I was particularly excited about. When I heard that Petco is going public, I chuckled to myself as an investor in Chewy, which is partly owned by PetSmart, thinking this is a business that is trying to capitalize on the hype and excitement around pets during the pandemic. It's smart of them to try to get some value out of the equity during this time, but I think investors are smart enough not to buy it. When I see shares up nearly 60% on opening day, it occurred to me, maybe not all investors. [laughs]
Hill: Jason, another IPO we saw was Affirm, which is a fintech company, looking to disrupt the credit card industry. Shares of Affirm doubled on its opening day. What do you make of that business?
Moser: Fintech and SaaS, I mean, if you want to really garner some support from the market, just classify yourself as a fintech or SaaS. Hey, you put those two together, the possibilities are limitless. I think in Affirm's case, this is a company that's focused now on this burgeoning ""buy now, pay later"" market. It's this market that is just really starting to come into the consumer's mindset here and that you could buy something now and you can pay for it incrementally over time. That really is what Affirm is all about. They make their money a couple of different ways. From merchant customers, they earn a fee when they help them actually convert that sale. Then from consumers, they earn a little bit of interest income on those loans essentially when they're doing those ""buy now, pay later"" deals. You believe that in today's environment, that's not the most attractive line of business in that interest income, given where rates are today. But part of the enthusiasm behind this company is something that, I think I noted this on Monday's MarketFoolery, there's this notion now that consumers are really happy to turn to technology companies they trust in order for financial services.
There was a survey conducted by the Harris Poll back in 2020, where 64% of Americans would consider purchasing or applying for financial products through a technology company's platform instead of a traditional financial services provider. Then that sentiment actually rises to 81% for Americans aged between 18 and 34 years, and that really is the target demographic for Affirm's customers. I'm not saying the valuation makes sense, but I do understand the enthusiasm. Something to keep an eye on, their top merchant partner is Peloton, responsible for about 30% of the company's revenue right now. I would rather see them diversify away and not be so levered at one particular company. I suspect that'll come in time.
Hill: In addition to IPOs, it was also a week of notable secondary offerings. Zoom Video announced it's going to raise $1.5 billion through a secondary stock offering. Lemonade announced a three million share secondary stock offering that they are planning. Emily, are you buying?
Flippen: Neither of these companies were particularly punished by the market for these secondary offerings. While I have my own reservations about Lemonade, I think it's fair to say both Lemonade and Zoom investors are not investing in these businesses because they expect for them to buy back shares or issue dividends, they're expecting growth. So, when you look at these businesses, Lemonade, unprofitable. But looking to raise money, you have to ask yourself, OK, what is the business going to do with this money? In the case of Zoom, they're profitable, but raising more than $1.5 billion, investors ask themselves, man, that's a lot of cash. What do I think Zoom is going to do with $1.5 billion? Growth investors are definitely expecting Zoom to maybe reach out to acquire, expand their product suite. I'm looking forward to potentially some exciting acquisitions coming from Zoom. In the case of Lemonade, raising more than $500 million from their three million shares additionally issued, they're looking at expanding their insurance suite. Getting into things like life insurance, that's what investors in these businesses want to happen. They want for them to continue to expand growth, even if it is at the cost of further dilution. So, neither is particularly bad, expect for the stocks to be under a little bit of pressure, that's understandable. But long-term, if they reinvest this money to support growth, all fine and dandy.
Hill: Like you, Emily, I was struck by the fact that on the day that both of these were announced and they were announced on the same day, shares at both companies were up. Typically, when the average company comes out, announces a secondary stock offering, we see a little bit of a sell-off. Is that more unsettling to you than what we saw from Petco's IPO, or is Petco's IPO still number one on your fear-inducing list?
Flippen: Petco IPO definitely wins for No. 1 on my fear-inducing list. I think if I was an investor in businesses like Lemonade or Zoom, I would ask myself, what are they going to do with that money? If you are raising equity, but you do not create value from whatever you reinvest it into, and that eventually does need to turn into cash value, cash creation. If they're not able to do that, then it would concern me more. But I believe, especially in the case of Zoom, that they'll be able to do something really smart with that money.
Hill: One of the big stories in the financial industry was Visa's (NYSE: V) acquisition of Plaid, a fintech start-up company in a deal worth more than $5 billion. This week, Visa said the deal is off due to antitrust concerns raised by the U.S. Department of Justice. Shares of Visa are down 6% this week. What do you think, Jason? Should Visa have fought Uncle Sam to push this one through?
Moser: They're just so many great spaceballs jokes that came from this deal. I'm sorry to see it die, but I do think with Visa, they saw the writing on the wall. When [laughs] regulators are already referring to you as a monopoly, it's going to be an uphill battle. Though it's worth noting in November that MasterCard was allowed to buy Finicity, which is a very similar style of fintech business. I think a lot of that has to do with the fact that MasterCard is a smaller business with a smaller share in the debit market. I think that regulators' concerns were the potential for Visa's monopoly status in the debit market. That really would have been difficult to overcome with the Plaid acquisition because Plaid doesn't really have a status in the debit market today, it's a fintech company. It is working on building these types of tools that enable money to get from point A to point B more quickly and more cheaply. I think on the flip side, this certainly opens up another opportunity for an IPO to triple on its first day of trading, because I would imagine Plaid eventually is going to go public. But I do understand regulators' concerns there. Now with that said, this is really all about the evolution of how we move money around. Technology is changing it and bringing costs down considerably, that's nothing new. Visa and MasterCard's toll booth models, they work well today. They've worked well for a long time, but they're not undisruptive, nothing really is. This is a situation where you get a couple of companies' massive market capitalizations closing. I think combined, $1 trillion dollar market capitalization with the two of them. They have a ton of resources and the ability to compete. I don't think this is something that is devastating Visa's business, it definitely has to send it back to the drawing board to see how they want to pursue this idea going forward in regard to fintech and the way technology is changing the space.
Hill: Shares of Beyond Meat up more than 15% this week on the news of an unlikely new partner, Taco Bell. That's right, Taco Bell is looking to bring in vegetarian customers and says it will be testing a new menu item later this year with a Beyond Meat product. Emily, why not?
Flippen: Chris, I don't appreciate your sarcasm [laughs] if I might be honest with you. The tone of your voice, the way you say, ""Taco Bell,"" I feel personally a little bit attacked. I think that the people who are Taco Bell lifestyle enthusiasts may also feel a little bit attacked. [laughs] But this is actually a great deal for Beyond Meat. The reason is because food service elsewhere Beyond Meat over the past few quarters have been extremely tough and the stock has been under a lot of pressure because of the fall off from restaurants sales as a result of the pandemic. Getting deals with fast food and fast casual restaurants is critical for bringing Beyond Meat back to growth. The reason why this is so big and the reason why it's up 15% on a simple deal with Taco Bell, which is great, by the way, is because they actually won this out over competitors. Back in 2019, Taco Bell met with a Beyond Meat competitor that's Impossible Foods, to potentially roll something out, and they decided not to take that partnership. This year, going with Taco Bell, because they're going with Beyond Meat, says something about its product. I look forward to both investing in Beyond Meat, seeing where that brings the company, but also consuming whatever delicious creation these two companies come up with.
Hill: Taco Bell lifestyle enthusiasts can send their angry emails to me at radio@fool.com. Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) is getting its third CEO in the past three years. Bob Swan is stepping down next month, VMware CEO Pat Gelsinger will take over at Intel. The immediate reaction from Wall Street was clear, shares of Intel up 15% this week, VMware shares down 5%, Jason.
Moser: Well, remember we were talking about JPMorgan and that advantage of having focused leadership for so long there and Jamie Dimon. Intel, that's the opposite. [laughs] Three CEOs in three years, that's not what you really are aiming for. I think Intel's problem is transcend leadership. I think it could be argued their troubles are a direct result of wanting to have their cake and eat it too as a designer and the manufacturer, and it's really slowed them down. I think for Intel, they really need to choose a lane. To that point, they've been transitioning away from a PC based company more to a data-centric company. That certainly is a very big universe data-centric. You'd go a lot of different ways with that. I think that Mr. Swan, he doesn't have the tech background, that doesn't really seem ideal. That could have been a problem. Conversely, if you look at a company like Qualcomm for example, and even outgoing CEO, Mr. Mollenkopf, incoming CEO Cristiano Amon, they both have electrical engineering backgrounds. I think that's really helped Qualcomm's calls through the years.
I actually think that in this case for Intel, they may be thinking they need to find a meaningful acquisition as soon as possible in order to get things moving. Because turning things around at this stage of the game for a tech company like this, when things are already moving so quickly, it's going to be really difficult. Then you look at the overall environment here, Qualcomm just making an acquisition of NUVIA for $1.4 billion, you get Nvidia and Arm merging, Marvell acquiring Inphi, AMD acquiring Xilinx. There's consolidation going on in space. Intel, it's a big company with a lot of resources, but they're getting left in the dust here. If you look at just Qualcomm's performance compared to Intel over the last several years, Qualcomm is just leaving them in the dust. I think it's going to be a big challenge for Intel. Maybe new leadership is the answer, because it doesn't seem like they've really found the right mind yet to take this company to the next level.
Hill: Real quick, Pat Gelsinger does have a tech background. He was the first ever Chief Technology Officer at Intel, so he's going back to Intel. How long before we know if he's the right person for the job, a year?
Moser: Well, I think a year is a fair number to at least start assessing, because you've given them a full four quarters to report and demonstrate what the strategy is. Much more than that though, like I said, this space moves really fast, so they got to really get things going.
Hill: Exciting news this week from Unilever, the consumer product parent company of Ben & Jerry's. This week, the ice cream maker is launching Doggie Desserts, a line of frozen treats available online and in grocery stores. Emily, I saw this news and I thought, ""Well, that's cute."" Then I realized, [laughs] ""No, this isn't just cute, this is really smart business.""
Flippen: This is playing off of a longer term trend that we've seen in the pet space. It's the same thing that's catalyzing Chewy and this crazy Petco IPO. It's that people love their pets and that really shouldn't be a surprise. These are people who treat their pets like kids, and as a result, are willing to do anything and in this case, pay anything to make their pets' lives as wonderful as possible. It's actually amazing to me that we didn't think about things like pet, or dog in this case, ice cream earlier. But this is where Ben & Jerry's is going to expand their product line into pets. The issue here isn't pet ice cream, is the fact that this dog ice cream looks so good. I think I might eat it. [laughs]
Hill: One of the best-performing stocks over the past five years is Twilio, a cloud communications platform that adds messaging, voice, and video to mobile apps and the apps on the web. Twilio shares have risen more than 1,300% since 2016. Jeff Lawson is a software developer who also happens to be a Co-Founder and the CEO of Twilio. He just published his first book, Ask Your Developer: How to Harness the Power of Software Developers and Win in the 21st Century. He recently talked with Motley Fool Co-Founder, David Gardner, and Tech Analyst, Tim Beyers, about how Twilio is organized, the values that guide the company, and of course, software.
[...]
Jeff Lawson: The amazing thing about software is that you can continually iterate on it. You're never done. You can always listen to your customers and hear something better that you could be doing, get a new feature request, or even if it's something simple like making it faster or whatever. There's always ways in which you can improve the software, and that creates a cycle of continuous improvement. But in the market there is also competition between companies who aren't your business. That pace of software, you hear like, ''Oh, the business world is getting faster and faster.'' A lot of that is because of software. Because software invites you to continually iterate and make it better and better. Think about all those apps on your phone. They're downloading updates now silently, you don't even know it. You're getting new versions of those apps pretty much every week. They're fixing bugs, they are getting better, and they're adding new features and functionality that are going to make your use of that app even better. That's really the superpower of the world of software, and that's one of the reasons why it's so important for companies to really embrace that. Because if your competitors are really embracing that and iterating quickly in running a lot of experiments to figure out what customers want and they don't want, and you are not, you're relatively static. You wrote the software a few years ago and let it sit there. Well, guess who customers are going to actually find to be a better option? The company that's always testing and iterating and getting better and better. That's why it becomes a little self-fulfilling.
You mentioned that Twilio provides the infrastructure for developers and companies to be able to do that, and you're right. We arose because software developers and the companies who employ them saw the need to work more iteratively and to move faster, and therefore, infrastructure like Twilio or Amazon Web Services or Stripe arose to serve those customers, to enable them to then meet the cadence of software and to serve their customers at Internet scale and Internet speed. But then, because we exist, now more companies can get on that bandwagon and more companies can execute with that iterative spirit, and then that makes the importance of it even more for every company. It really is folding into this whole build versus die thing. Because just the nature of business and the speed of iteration and the speed of competition has just accelerated in recent years because of that power of software, it's just built-in.
David Gardner: Really well put, Jeff. I used to say around the halls of Fool HQ, whoever has the most techies wins, and so I'm very much, I guess, sympatical with you on this. That's been part of how I think about every industry when I pick stocks. So, ask the developer, who has the developers? Many of our viewers who have not yet gotten to see your wonderful book, don't know that the title comes directly from, well, basically, a billboard that you put outside Silicon Valley for everybody to drive by and you were working with your marketing team and nobody came up with a good idea and you finally just said, ''Let's go with 'Ask the Developer'.'' Which is a brilliant stroke, and so this has to be one of the few books that I could think of that started with a billboard as the title eventually of the book. I wanted just to shift briefly to Amazon. You speak highly of Amazon, Jeff, both of your time there and where it is today, of course, that's been another long-term hold for us, a great company. Specifically though, Jeff, you credit Amazon for the inspiration for organizing in small teams. I'm curious if you'd like to just lay that out a little bit for our members so they can hear and understand what that means. Then maybe was there another best practice that you've learned from Amazon?
Lawson: Absolutely. Most companies, there's a tendency as they get bigger and bigger, they slow down, they get more bureaucratic, and decision-making gets obfuscated and the employee base just loses its energy that it might have had when it was a start-up. That's the natural tendency of companies, and here's the interesting thing about Amazon. I got hired there in 2004. My friend Dave Schappell hired me. HTe had started at Amazon when there were about 100 people. I got hired, the company was about 5,000 people. Dave promptly quit, he was like, ''Okay, I've been here long enough.'' He left shortly after I got there, he went and started a start-up, and that start-up later got acquired back by Amazon. When Dave landed back at Amazon, the company was 75,000 people. [laughs] Okay, so here's this guy, my friend Dave, who's like, ''You've been at this company. You saw it at 100 people, you saw it at 5,000 people, and now you see it at 75,000 thousand people.'' I called him up one day, this about 2011, and because I was starting to scale Twilio and I'm like, ''How do I make some good decisions here?"" I said, ""Dave, can you compare and contrast those three versions of Amazon? 100 people, 5,000 people, 75,000 people, because it must be totally different.'' He thought about it for a minute and he said, ''Do you know what? It's exactly the same."" The same energy, the same drive, the same bounce, and people staff, the same intellect of the employee base, It's the same company. It just, I work with the 100 people who are closest to me. I would just have no idea that there's 75,000 other groups of those people all around the company. Because it feels like that same start-up I joined in 1997. I thought, ''That is astounding.'' The secret to that is keeping it small, small teams.
When you build a company, when you're growing the company, the goal is to try to keep that energy, that intrinsic drive that every employee has in the early days of a start-up, and replicate it many times over as you get bigger. The way to do that is to continually divide the company and divide the mission of the company into small teams. Teams of no more than say, 10 people, and organize those teams around three things. No. 1, a customer. No. 2, the mission for what they're trying to solve for that customer, and three, the metrics of success that tell you if they're actually succeeding in that endeavor. With those three things, now what you've done is you've unleashed that team's ability to go sprint for that customer every day and to go innovate and try to be as autonomous and independent as possible, and in that small group setting, every member is really connected to the customer and really connected to the mission because it's small again, and you think about a small team of say, 10 people, if there's a low performer on that team or someone who's checked out, you're not going to get by for long in that type of environment. Whereas if you are one of 500 people on a team, you're like, ''Yeah, it's easy to get lost in the shuffle, but when you're on one with 10 people, with a strong sense of ownership over what you're trying to accomplish, somebody who's checked out won't make it very long, and everybody is very close to the decision-making and very close to the customer they're serving. I think that's the magic of how you scale a company while keeping everybody really motivated, really driven, and coming from a position of really understanding why they're there and what success looks like at the local level, at their team level.
Gardner: Jeff, have you just described how Twilio is organized?
Lawson: Yes. That's how we've done it as well, and I talk in the book, it sounds easier said than done because if you're a small company, you're a start-up, ""Okay, I've got 10 people"" or if you're a big company, you have a new initiative, maybe it's got the 10 people, but then it's succeeding and it starts growing, so it becomes 20 people or 30 people, you are like, ''Oh, what do I do now? My team that was nice and small just got big.'' Well, the answer is it's like a mitosis process. You keep dividing the team and you divide the missions and you divide actually the technology, like the code behind it, so that you can continually divide back into small teams that tackle various parts of the business. But every team in that story is connected to a mission and has a lot of drive to do that thing really well. I talk in the book about how you can scale something, whether it's a start-up or whether it's an initiative inside of a bigger company, and continually divide it to keep that entrepreneurial spirit even as the company or the initiative continues to grow.
Tim Beyers: Jeff, you talk a little bit in the book about how you try to make the values very actionable. Twilio has, if you look at it and I encourage anybody, if you're an investor or thinking about investing in Twilio, definitely take a look at the site and the list of values that Twilio has, one of them is, ""Wear the customer's shoes,"" you talk about this in the book, and it seems like what you're talking about just there, about dividing into small teams is a way to actionably wear the customer's shoes, because if you have a huge team, most of the people can't be near the customer. But how do you make it where, say, like the accountants are near to the customer? There's only so many people that can be near to the customer. But can you talk a little bit about this value, and how you get everybody a little bit closer to the customer?
Lawson: Well, it's interesting when you think about it, companies, in the early days of a company, like, I'll talk about the early days of Twilio.
Beyers: Yeah.
Lawson: On any given day, I might be writing some code, talking to a customer who's a sales prospect, supporting a customer with customer support and paying some bills, like you're doing everything. As companies grow, the tendency, of course, is for there to be silos, because people get more functional. You hire experts to do each of those things. There's a lot of great things about hiring an amazing customer support team, so that the developers who are building the product don't have to answer every support ticket. Obviously, that is beneficial, but the problem is if you let it go too far, you end up putting these walls up that separate all the functions. You can have a sales team who's doing sales and their job would be to not have to bring the developers in every conversation with a customer. You've got sales engineers to do that or the customer support team; their job is to answer the support tickets as opposed to having the engineers have to do it all. If you do it perfectly, what you've done is with all good intentions, you've accidentally siloed the people building your product from the very customers they're building it for.
Again, it all came from good intentions, including product managers. Many product managers see their job as protecting their team from the distraction of customers. I think the best product managers are those who see their job as facilitating interactions between their team and their customers. It's not every interaction, but if you don't poke holes in those walled silos that arise in the company, then yes, you will isolate your team from the very customers they're trying to serve. I love the story of one of the product leaders at Twilio; his name is Ben. He started his career, his first job out of college was he was a developer at Bloomberg writing software for the terminals. He got there bright-eyed and bushy-tailed and he said to his manager, ""Hey, when do we get to go to a trading floor to talk to your traders who are using our software?"" The manager laughed and said, ""Oh, yeah. That's a funny idea. We've never actually done that."" Ben was a little dumbfounded. He's like, ""You mean you've never met a customer that uses the software that you do every day yourself?"" [laughs] He's like, ""Well, not really."" Ben actually just found his own path. He went and found a friend of his who was a trader and he said, ""Do you mind if I stop by?"" Ben showed up at the trading floor and they had always assumed that their widget that they were building, like they spent every day building this widget, they assumed it was the full 27-inch screen was their beautiful widget. Well, it turns out that the trader had it in some tiny little, 16x16 box in the corner of their screen. It wasn't even legible. You couldn't read the fonts and it was completely different than how they imagined their software was used. It wasn't until they actually went and interacted with a customer that they actually found out. Then that changed their roadmap entirely. Like, ""We got to make fonts that work at small scale,"" and all these things happened.
I shared that example in the book because it's a really good example of what happens when those walls between you and the customer are so tall that you actually have no idea how your customers are actually using your product. As leaders, I think it's our job to intentionally poke holes in those walls that separate our teams from the customers they're serving.
Hill: Let's dive into the Fool Mailbag before we get to the stocks on our radar, our email address is radio@fool.com. I know the Taco Bell lifestyle enthusiasts are already typing out their emails but we also take stock questions like this one from Kyle Neuberger, who writes, ""Love the show, keep it coming. This question may seem simple, but in your experience, when should you sell a stock, if ever?"" A great question, Kyle. Thank you for that, and Jason, this is one we get often from people, because it's one of those things particularly in the wake of where are we now? Year 11, year 12 of, by and large, a bull market? People who are sitting on some gains are trying to figure out whether or not they should sell at least some of their stocks.
Moser: Yeah. I mean, it's something that I think we all think about. It may seem like a simple question, but really I think it's far more nuanced. When we look at insiders, for example, that own stakes in the companies that they lead, we talk about those insider transactions. We say, and Peter Lynch really popularized this, it's one reason to buy, but you've got many reasons to sell. That really is the bottom line, is there are many reasons to sell and it does depend on the individual, where they are in their life. I think just a general rule of thumb though, if you're a younger investor with a lot of time in front of you, you'd look at selling a stock, No. 1, have the reasons that you bought it changed? Are the reasons you purchased that stock in the first place, have those reasons changed? If they have, then you do a little bit more of an assessment there. Do you feel like it still offers opportunity? If it doesn't, there could be some reasons to sell there if the thesis is broken and the reasons have changed, but clearly, there are going to be many more reasons. Someone needs to consider it and it really depends on where you are in your life and what you need to do with that money, what your investing goals really are.
Hill: Emily, obviously some people, if they've been investing for a while, maybe they look at the stocks that aren't doing as well in their portfolio and look to sell those off sometimes for tax reasons. What do you think about selling?
Flippen: Yes, well, there are two biggest mistakes that investors can make. One is not buying companies that end up being disruptors and game-changers that become the next Amazons and Netflix. The second one is selling those companies too early. If you're an investor looking at their portfolio and feeling the need to sell for issues of valuation, just remember that good companies that are disruptors are hard to value for a reason and they end up growing longer and faster than many people expect. That alone, in my opinion, isn't a good reason to sell, but what is a good reason to sell is when the thesis for owning the company has changed. Maybe that means that it's been a bad performer and you think to yourself this money could better be invested in a disruptor, in a company that I have higher conviction in. That's a perfectly fine reason. Or another perfectly fine reason is if you find yourself staying up at night worrying about companies because they've become such a large part of your portfolio. If you find yourself constantly afraid of the fact that you have maybe 20% of your portfolio in Shopify, just to name one. Even though you believe in Shopify, I think selling that to get it to the point where you're not losing sleep, when you're not feeling stressed over your allocation, is also a perfectly fine reason.
Hill: We've got just a couple of minutes left. Let's get to the stocks on our radar, Jason, you are up first. Dan Boyd is going to hit you with a question, what are you looking at this week?
Moser: Yeah, I've been digging into a company called Penumbra (NYSE: PEN); ticker is PEN and this is a global healthcare company that designs, develops, manufactures, and markets medical devices and technology focused on neurovascular and cardiovascular applications. The numbers are pretty astounding actually on a global basis. Stroke is the second leading cause of death, the third leading cause of serious long-term disability, and that really is the problem that Penumbra is trying to tackle. Founder-led business, co-founders still own a little bit of a stake in the company. I think it's really neat, but what really has my attention is this real immersive system that they developed. It's an advanced rehabilitation technology that uses virtual reality for therapeutic activities. You talk about folks who have strokes and that need rehabilitation, well, they're trying to tackle that using immersive technology. It has definitely got my attention. The management said it represents by far the largest total market opportunity that Penumbra has ever taken on. So, it got my attention.
Hill: Dan, question about Penumbra?
Dan Boyd: Yeah, sure. Jason, it looks like late last year Penumbra had some recall issues. Is that anything to worry about going forward?
Moser: Well, it is something always to keep an eye on with medical device makers. Recalls are part and parcel of the business. It does look like something that they have accounted for, but it's always something to keep in mind. It's a risk that comes with these types of companies for sure.
Hill: Emily Flippen, what are you looking at?
Flippen: If I was smart, I would've talked about BarkBox today with all the pet news, but the company that's on my radar this week is actually Pinterest. With all the excitement that Poshmark is getting in the news, it's reminding me about Pinterest, which is a social-media-meets-e-commerce business that I like a lot more than Poshmark. Pinterest has over 400 million monthly active users and it's just at the precipice of effectively monetizing that audience.
Hill: Dan?
Boyd: Not really a question, Chris, more of a comment. Pinterest terrifies me [laughs] because I know whenever my wife is on it, it means that an impending large purchase is going to happen. Maybe that means it's a good business.
Flippen: It does.
Hill: Dan, I'm assuming you never make large purchases of any kind. What do you want to add to your watchlist this week?
Boyd: Listen, man. I've seen it happen so many times. I'm going with Pinterest. I think they're onto something over there.
Hill: All right, Jason Moser, Emily Flippen, thanks for being here.
Moser: Thank you.
Flippen: Thanks for having me.
Hill: That's going to do it for this week's show. The show is mixed by Dan Boyd. Our producer is Mac Greer. I'm Chris Hill. Thanks for listening. We'll see you next week.

2021-01-06 00:00:00+00:00,"Why Marvell, Qualcomm, and Broadcom Surged as Much as 79% in 2020",MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-marvell-qualcomm-and-broadcom-surged-as-much-as-79-in-2020-2021-01-06,,,"What happened
Shares of Marvell Technology Group (NASDAQ: MRVL), Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM), and Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) rose 79%, 72.7%, and 38.6%, respectively, in 2020, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence.
What's even better? All three also pay out hefty dividends, and their total returns, including dividends, were 80.2%, 77%, and 44.9%.
MRVL 1-Year Total Returns (Daily). Data by YCharts
Aside from dividends, all three stocks also had another thing in common that propelled them higher in 2020.
So what
The buildout of 5G infrastructure across the world, along with the advent of new 5G handset models, propelled all three semiconductor stocks higher.
The biggest gainer, Marvell Technologies, has adapted its product portfolio over the past few years in preparation for the 5G era. Its legacy business produced controllers for the flow of data from storage media like solid-state drives and hard disc drives. However, Marvell repositioned its business by developing standard and semi-custom 5G base station chips, as well as customized application-specific integrated chips (ASICs) for 5G base stations. Its 2019 acquisition of Avera Semi aided with the latter.
This year, those bets started paying off. Major 5G radio infrastructure companies Samsung and Nokia (NYSE: NOK) selected Marvell's ASIC to power its current 5G base stations back in March. That growth fueled positive earnings beats throughout the year. Last quarter, Marvell's networking group grew 35%, accelerating over the first and second quarters as 5G infrastructure deployment ramped up globally.

To cap off the year, Marvell was added to the Nasdaq 100 in December, giving the stock a final lift to an impressive 2020.
5G also boosted Qualcomm last year. As the dominant player in wireless modems, Qualcomm is set to benefit from most premium handsets that can carry 5G signals. Not only does Qualcomm produce the world's best modems, but it also owns the key patents in wireless connectivity. It also charges customers a license fee for every handset sold based on the price of the phone. As 5G handsets will mostly be more expensive than 4G handsets, Qualcomm's licensing revenues should also benefit handsomely.
Qualcomm won a consequential court appeal in August around those very same licensing revenues. The company had previously lost a case brought by the Federal Trade Commission in 2019. The judge ruled that Qualcomm would have to renegotiate its licensing deals with handset makers. However, that decision was reversed in August on appeal to a higher court, giving Qualcomm a victory that will save it literally billions of dollars.
Broadcom is also benefiting from the 5G revolution, though perhaps because its business is more diversified than Marvell and Qualcomm, its stock didn't rise quite as much.
Still, Broadcom's wide-ranging chip portfolio includes front-end RF filters, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS, and custom touch controllers for mobile handsets, in addition to chips in the optical and fiber infrastructure that provides the backbone for mobile and cloud networks.
Broadcom also benefited from the broader ""connected everything"" theme and digital transformation due to its other products that go into data centers, broadband infrastructure, automated factories and cars, and cybersecurity.
Now what
While these three companies have had a terrific 2020, they have really been on a great two-year run ever since the late 2018 trade war crash, and all sport somewhat high valuations (except Broadcom). As such, I wouldn't expect 2021 returns to match those of 2020.
MRVL P/E Ratio (Forward). Data by YCharts
Still, I don't expect a huge correction either, as the 5G tailwinds should remain intact for these companies over the next few years. More growth-oriented and aggressive investors may wish to ride Marvell's transformation, while risk-off investors may wish to look at Broadcom, which is the most diversified and sports a higher dividend. Qualcomm remains a happy medium between the two.

2021-01-05 00:00:00+00:00,This Leading Hedge Fund Has $1 Billion Invested in These 3 Stocks,MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/this-leading-hedge-fund-has-%241-billion-invested-in-these-3-stocks-2021-01-05,,,"The clue is in the description. Activist hedge fund Starboard Value tends to invest in companies with a view to helping them unlock the potential in the business. The formula usually involves encouraging management to restructure the company in order to improve profit margins in line with its peers. Successes include turnarounds at Darden Restaurants and Marvell Technology after Starboard placed directors on the board. Based on the fund's last 13F filing at the SEC, the fund holds over $1 billion in three stocks: auto parts retailer Advance Auto Parts (NYSE: AAP), engineering consultancy AECOM (NYSE: ACM), and agriscience company Corteva (NYSE: CTVA). Let's take a look.
Advance Auto Parts
It's fair to say that the auto parts retailer hasn't lived up to expectations since Starboard's involvement in 2015. Back then, the hope was that Advance would be able to raise its earnings margin toward its peers, O'Reilly Automotive and AutoZone. But the reality has been continued underperformance. For reference in the chart below, EBITDA is earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation, and amortization.
Data by YCharts
In addition, Starboard had hoped to improve Advance's cash flow generation by turning over inventories quicker and extending payables terms, again using its peers as a target. One way to look at it is to take the ratio of accounts payable to inventory.
A higher number for accounts payable implies the company is holding onto cash longer, and a lower number for inventory implies the company has less cash tied up in inventory. Therefore, a higher ratio number is better.
Unfortunately, Advance Auto Parts continues to lag behind its peers on this metric.
Data by YCharts
Given the evidence above, there's no compelling reason to buy Advance over O'Reilly or AutoZone right now, and Starboard actually reduced its stake in the company in the third quarter.
Consequently, Advance Auto Parts is probably worth avoiding for value investors right now.
AECOM
The restructuring at infrastructure consultancy and design company AECOM seems to be faring better than at Advance Auto Parts. Starboard's view was that AECOM had executed poorly in the past, and there was a significant opportunity to unlock value by improving operational performance and divesting less profitable businesses.
Management has clearly reacted to Starboard's criticisms and AECOM has been slimmed down over the last two years. For example, management sold the management services business for $2.4 billion in early 2020. Furthermore, its power construction business was sold in October, and an agreement to sell its civil construction business is in place for January.

Alongside the divestitures, management has been reducing overhead by consolidating from nine regions to five and simplifying its decision-making processes. Many of these changes are in line with Starboard's recommendations and appear to follow the playbook set by AECOM's peer Jacobs Engineering Group when it turned its business around.
The changes at AECOM gave management the confidence to forecast a 9% increase in EBITDA in 2021 to $790 million-$830 million, with free cash flow in the range of $425 million-$625 million. The midpoint of these forecasts would put AECOM on an enterprise value (market cap plus net debt)-to-EBITDA multiple of less than 10 times, and a price-to-free cash flow multiple of around 14 times.
Those valuations make the stock look very attractive, and if you believe that infrastructure spending will remain strong in the coming years, then AECOM is worth buying.
Corteva
You guessed it. The case for buying agriscience company Corteva is based on the idea that it can, and should, increase its profit margin in line with its peers. The company, a spinoff from the former DowDuPont in 2019, generates around 45% of its revenue from crop protection and 55% from seeds. As Starboard's CEO Jeff Smith outlined at a presentation in October, Corteva's adjusted EBITDA margin is below its peers in both seeds and in crop protection.
Image source: Getty Images.
Smith has a point. After all, Wall Street analysts are expecting Corteva to report an EBITDA margin close to 14.1% in 2020. That's a figure significantly below Bayer Crop Science's (seeds and crop protection) adjusted EBITDA margin of 26.9% in the first nine months of 2020. In addition, a crop protection company, FMC, is expected to post an EBITDA margin of 27.6%.
Clearly, there's a lot of potential for Corteva to increase margins in the future. Indeed, the company's management is already planning for margin expansion to lead to 12%-16% EBITDA growth over the midterm.
Trading on an estimated EV/EBITDA multiple of 11.4 times 2021 earnings, and with the potential to significantly increase EBITDA in the future, Corteva is an attractive stock for investors looking to follow Starboard into a value opportunity.

A third-party report estimates that 113 operators had deployed the next-generation technology in 52 commercial markets across the world by September 2020. What's more, 35 telecom operators reportedly joined the 5G bandwagon in the first half of 2020, as compared to 21 over the same period in 2019.
The deployment of 5G networks is expected to gather more steam in 2021 as many wireless frequency spectrum auctions by various governments had to be delayed because of the pandemic. Not surprisingly, the 5G base station (cell tower) market is expected to keep growing at a high compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 33.7% in the future, even though its revenue more than doubled in 2020 to almost $14 billion, according to third-party estimates. The report also points out that the global 5G base station market could exceed $179 billion in revenue by 2028 as the service reaches more markets.
This is great news for companies such as Marvell Technology Group (NASDAQ: MRVL) and Analog Devices (NASDAQ: ADI) that supply base station-related infrastructure. Let's see how these companies can take advantage of 5G deployments in 2021.
Image source: Getty Images.
1. Marvell Technology Group is riding the growth in 5G base stations
Marvell Technology supplies application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) and embedded processors that are used in 5G base stations. The chipmaker launched an end-to-end 5G platform at the beginning of 2019 to speed up the deployment of 5G infrastructure that was meant to replace expensive and power-hungry field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs).
That move seems to be paying off handsomely for Marvell, as its networking business (accounting for 59% of the total revenue) has accelerated in the ongoing fiscal year. Marvell's networking revenue shot up 15% year over year in the first quarter of fiscal 2021, followed by a 23% increase in the second quarter, and an even better jump of 35% in the third quarter that ended on Oct. 31, 2020.
The terrific growth of Marvell's networking business in recent quarters isn't surprising, as the company is supplying its chips to the leading 5G infrastructure OEMs (original equipment manufacturers). Samsung announced in March 2020 that it is making base station infrastructure based on Marvell's embedded processors. Nokia, another major telecom gear manufacturer, also announced in March 2020 that it is using Marvell's processors to power its 5G solutions.
Nokia and Samsung are expected to account for just over 30% of the global mobile base station market this year, according to market research firm TrendForce, indicating that Marvell is well placed to take advantage of the huge growth on offer in the 5G base station market. Additionally, the chipmaker has been able to bring on board regional telecom operators looking to deploy 5G networks. CEO Matt Murphy said on the last earnings conference call, ""Our 5G customer base continues to expand and the second regional customer has selected Marvell's industry-leading OCTEON Fusion-based NAND processors to power their new 5G base stations.""
In all, Marvell Technology's networking business looks set for better days ahead, thanks to the growing demand for 5G base stations. What's more, the stock trades at just 21 times trailing earnings. So investors looking for a top 5G stock trading at a reasonable valuation should not miss out on Marvell Technology.
2. Analog Devices is about to turn on the heat
Analog Devices' fortunes have started turning around, thanks to a recovery in the semiconductor market. But the rollout of 5G networks could give it an additional boost. Communications, which supplied 20% of Analog's total revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, was its best-performing segment during the quarter, with year-over-year revenue growth of 19% as demand for its 5G chips increased.
Looking ahead, Analog Devices anticipates global 5G deployments to play a key role in its growth, with CEO Vincent Roche remarking on the last earnings conference call that it is ""the market leader in 5G, a position that will deliver significant growth as 5G broadens globally in 2021 and beyond.""
Roche's comments are likely to turn into reality in the new year and beyond, as Analog Devices is already working with key players engaged in the 5G rollout. It partnered with Samsung in 2018 to deploy one of the first 5G networks in South Korea, with the two companies rolling out the network in just three months as compared to the normal duration of six months.
Analog's radio frequency transceivers were also selected by Marvell Technology in December 2020. Marvell is using Analog's transceivers in a massive multiple-input, multiple-output (MIMO) radio unit that's critical for the functioning of 5G networks. Allied Market Research estimates that the global massive MIMO market could clock a CAGR of 35% through 2027, hitting nearly $16 billion in revenue.
So, Analog's partnership with Marvell could pay off in the long run as the latter already has strong connections in the 5G infrastructure space. What's more, demand for the 5G RF (radio frequency) transceivers that Analog sells is also expected to grow at more than 30% a year until the end of the decade, according to a third-party report.
All of this demonstrates why Analog management is confident in winning big from the deployment of 5G networks in the coming years. Analyst estimates compiled by Yahoo! Finance also signal better times for Analog Devices this fiscal year, indicating that the company could deliver double-digit revenue and earnings growth. For comparison, Analog's revenue had slipped 6% in the recently concluded fiscal 2020.
The deployment of 5G will be a key catalyst for Analog Devices next year and add to the tailwinds that it is witnessing in other areas of the business -- making it an ideal bet for investors looking for a diversified 5G play.
