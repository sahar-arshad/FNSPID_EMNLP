2021-06-25 00:00:00+00:00,Better Buy: Advanced Micro Devices vs. Intel,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/better-buy%3A-advanced-micro-devices-vs.-intel-2021-06-25,,,"The battle between Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) has long preoccupied tech investors. After decades of lagging its larger rival, AMD has benefited from a significant technical lead and faster growth rates under the leadership of CEO Lisa Su.
However, since Pat Gelsinger became CEO of Intel earlier this year, he has implemented a plan to revitalize its fabs and catch up technologically. While that does not make Intel a better investment by itself, it may warrant another review of the value propositions of each chip stock.

Can Intel threaten AMD's technical lead?
Intel has struggled with limitations regarding its existing 10nm chips and does not expect to manufacture its own 7nm chips until 2023. This stands in contrast to AMD, which released its first 7nm chip in 2019. Moreover, its investors should be excited by the company's client list alone. Not only does AMD provide the GPU for Microsoft's Xbox and Sony's PlayStation, but its chips also power the operations of cars built by Tesla.
Additionally, Intel will probably not bounce back anytime soon. Chip development cycles usually run between three and five years. Thus, even if Intel has placed a viable comeback plan in motion, the market will have to wait years to see any potential results.
However, for all of its successes, AMD depends on Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC) (NYSE: TSM) to produce its chips. In the midst of a global chip shortage, this leaves AMD dependent on TSMC's production limitations, particularly since TSMC also makes chips for numerous other fabless chip companies.
To add to the dangers, China has recently reiterated its longtime ambition to absorb Taiwan, the location of most of TSMC's fabs. While China has never carried out that threat, such geopolitical tensions may have inspired the U.S. Senate to approve subsidies for onshore chipmakers.
Since Intel produces most of its chips in the U.S., such a capital infusion increases the chances that Intel could find a way to close the technical lead currently held by AMD and TSMC. While an Intel resurgence may appear improbable, investors should remember that AMD's comeback seemed unlikely when Su became CEO in 2014. Thus, investors should not assume that Intel cannot also close the gap.
The financial indicators
Despite concerns about both chipmakers, the financials point to neither a meaningful chance of a Taiwan invasion nor a likely comeback of Intel.
AMD reported record revenue of just over $3.4 billion in the first quarter, a 93% increase from year-ago levels. As a result, GAAP net income surged 243% higher to $555 million as lower growth in operating expenses allowed income to rise. This exceeded the 45% surge in revenue, but fell below the 630% increase in net income in fiscal 2020 compared with 2019 levels. A tax valuation allowance of $1.3 billion fueled most of the earnings increase in 2020.
Still, this stands in contrast to Intel, whose $19.7 billion in quarterly revenue was a 1% decline compared with the same quarter last year. In addition, net income fell 41% during that period due primarily to a $2.2 billion restructuring charge. Intel's revenue also rose 8% in 2020 compared with 2019, though net income dropped 1% as Intel's tax rate climbed.
AMD also continues to make strides on the free cash flow front. It generated $832 million in free cash flow, just under half of the nearly $1.6 billion reported by Intel. However, considering Intel earned close to six times as much revenue as AMD, AMD generated significantly more free cash flow per revenue dollar.
Given this difference, one can see why AMD stock climbed by about 54%, compared with an 8% decline for Intel. But these stock increases have made AMD more expensive. AMD sells for about 36 times earnings, compared with a 12 price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio for Intel.
AMD data by YCharts
AMD or Intel?
Despite AMD's higher valuation, investors should consider staying with it for now. Its considerable technical lead and much faster growth still make it the more appealing stock.
Indeed, AMD's dependence on TSMC carries with it both supply chain and geopolitical risks. Moreover, Intel's new management and the renewed interest in bolstering U.S.-based fabs point to the possibility of an Intel comeback. However, since investors will not know for years whether Intel will make that happen, AMD remains the safer bet.

2021-06-24 00:00:00+00:00,INTC August 6th Options Begin Trading,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intc-august-6th-options-begin-trading-2021-06-24,,,"Investors in Intel Corp (Symbol: INTC) saw new options become available today, for the August 6th expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the INTC options chain for the new August 6th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $53.50 strike price has a current bid of 42 cents. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $53.50, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $53.08 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of INTC, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $55.68/share today.
Because the $53.50 strike represents an approximate 4% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 100%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 0.79% return on the cash commitment, or 6.66% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Intel Corp, and highlighting in green where the $53.50 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $56.50 strike price has a current bid of $1.44. If an investor was to purchase shares of INTC stock at the current price level of $55.68/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $56.50. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 4.06% if the stock gets called away at the August 6th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if INTC shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Intel Corp, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing INTC's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $56.50 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $56.50 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 2.59% boost of extra return to the investor, or 21.95% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.
Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $55.68) to be 38%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

2021-06-24 00:00:00+00:00,How to Use the Stock Market to Generate Big Income Streams,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/how-to-use-the-stock-market-to-generate-big-income-streams-2021-06-24,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
I mentioned yesterday that I’m a numbers guy. I’ve always loved numbers, and there’s nothing more fun to me than rolling my sleeves up and digging into data. The stock market is made of numbers, so it’s no surprise that it’s one of the things I’m most interested in — and have profited from nicely, too.
Source: Shutterstock
In my 40-plus years of careful research and quantitative analysis, I’ve turned my love of numbers into a successful career as an adviser and investor. Along the way, I’ve helped my readers claim double- and triple-digit gains in the market and create a more secure future for themselves.
Interestingly, my career as an investor really started with a homework assignment.
As a grad student at Cal State Hayward some 40 years ago, a professor gave me an assignment that would change my life … and lead me down a path that would make me, and many of my subscribers, rich.
The assignment was to create a model that would mimic the S&P 500.

9 Oil & Gas Stocks to Buy to Play Rising Energy Prices
My professor wanted to prove that indexing was the best way to invest. Using Wells Fargo’s powerful mainframe computers, I completed the assignment — but there was one little problem.
My model didn’t just mirror the S&P’s performance, it actually beat it!
I was one of the first analysts to use advanced computer models to analyze the market — back when computers were cutting-edge technology.
Using those tools, and lots and lots of data, I was able to make calls like Nike, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) at 39 cents per share and Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) at $3.57 per share.
Leveraging mathematical analysis and the latest technology, I’ve established an impressive track record of growth. In fact, over 15 years, my large-cap stock picks beat Warren Buffet!
The lessons I learned in grad school are still serving me well today. Advanced technology is the single greatest tool investors can use to make investment decisions.
The truth is that the technology is moving so fast that even the proprietary market terminals are relics!
And that’s why I’ve kept evolving my proprietary Portfolio Grader system and used technology to take investing to the next level.
That system has helped my subscribers across all my research services achieve tremendous gains, like 371% in America Movil (NYSE:AMX) … 457% in Holly Corp (NYSE:HFC) … 612% in Santarus … And that’s just a drop in the bucket!
And now I’m ready to take that same approach to income investing.
Often, when investors think of generating income, bonds are the first investment that comes to mind. But in this ultralow interest rate environment, there’s little money to be made in the bond market. Even if you find a risky bond that pays a high yield, it’s still nothing to get excited about. You’re still looking at only around a 5% return per year.
A lot of folks get out of stocks and into bonds when they retire, because they think they’re safer.
But let me tell you, that’s the wrong way to go.
The reality is the best game in town is still the stock market. So, with the help of my Portfolio Grader, I’ve come up with a way to generate consistent income streams.
I call it my Accelerated Income Project 2021.
As I mentioned yesterday, this is a particular approach to income investing that can put thousands of dollars of cash into the hands of everyday Americans quickly and consistently.
By following this new income strategy, investors have the potential to put an extra $50,000 in their pockets over the next 12 months.
What I uncovered with my Accelerated Income Project 2021 is the best of all worlds — the potential for more consistency, more safety, and big yields.
To really understand my strategy, I’ve decided to hold an online presentation on Wednesday, June 30, to explain the full details.
The presentation I’ll detail could hold the key to helping solve America’s retirement crisis and help supplement income while America gets back to work.

2021-06-24 00:00:00+00:00,"Google expands Jio partnership with Indian smartphone, cloud tie-ups",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/google-expands-jio-partnership-with-indian-smartphone-cloud-tie-ups-2021-06-24,,,"By Sankalp Phartiyal
NEW DELHI, June 24 (Reuters) - Google deepened its partnership with Reliance Jio on Thursday with an ""ultra-affordable"" smartphone which could connect hundreds of millions of customers to high-speed mobile data and a cloud tie-up to boost the Indian telecoms firm's 5G push.
The 'JioPhone Next' has been developed by Alphabet's GOOGL.O Google and Jio for the Indian market, Mukesh Ambani, chairman of Reliance Industries RELI.NS of which Jio is a part, told his company's annual shareholder meeting.
Ambani, one of the world's richest men, wants to expand Jio's tech, telecoms and entertainment services through the new phone's launch in September.
India is the world's second-biggest mobile market with about 530 million smartphone users, but more than 300 million people still use legacy feature phones, Hong Kong-based tech consultancy Counterpoint Research says.
""This (the smartphone) is a testimony to a global technology giant and a national technology champion working together to make truly a breakthrough product that can be first introduced in India and then taken to the rest of the world,"" Ambani said.
He did not specify a price but promised it will be the most affordable smartphone ""not just in India, but globally"".
Ambani announced last year that Jio and Google would partner to make an Android-based smartphone operating system.
CLOUD PARTNERSHIP
Google, which last year invested $4.5 billion in Jio's parent Jio Platforms, also said it would help India's biggest wireless carrier with tech solutions for its enterprise and consumer offerings as it plans to launch 5G services.
The tie-up lends Jio the expertise of a global tech giant as it expands digital services to small and medium businesses as well as hundreds of millions of individuals. And it gives Google the unmatched scale of Reliance, whose businesses range from oil to telecoms and e-commerce.
""It's a broad partnership, it involves multiple pieces of Alphabet working together,"" Thomas Kurian, CEO at Google Cloud, told Reuters, adding: ""Our own partnership spans multiple parts of Jio not just the communications business ... but also health, retail and other things.""
He declined to share the terms of the cloud deal with Jio.
As part of this partnership, Reliance will shift its core retail businesses to Google Cloud's infrastructure, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said in a message played at Reliance's meeting.
Jio established a 10-year alliance with Microsoft MSFT.O in 2019, aiming to build data centres across India that will be hosted on its Azure cloud platform in a bid to offer services to the country's booming start-up economy.
Jio disrupted India's telecom market in 2016 when it launched with cut-price data plans and free voice services. It forced several competitors out of the market and is now India's biggest mobile carrier with more than 425 million customers.
On Thursday, Ambani said Jio, which also counts Facebook FB.O, Qualcomm QCOM.O and Intel INTC.O among its backers, was confident of being the first to launch 5G services in India.

It’s in an investor’s DNA to always be searching for the next big, big thing on Wall Street. But that doesn’t mean investors have to look far if that search begins with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock.

Today, let’s look at what NVDA stock has to offer investors both off and on the price chart.
Then we’ll look at one risk-adjusted strategy for investing more wisely.
NVDA. It’s the semiconductor market’s uncontested 800-pound gorilla. It’s not the largest by valuation. Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM) and its market cap of $542 billion is the richest by that measure.

9 Oil & Gas Stocks to Buy to Play Rising Energy Prices
There are larger chip stocks based on sales. Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is still the world’s biggest by that calculation. But that’s missing the point and in a huge way.
From data centers to gaming, autonomous autos, cryptocurrencies, artificial intelligence, genomics and computational biology and more, Nvidia’s array of graphics chips, more than any of its peers, play a key role in making those growth markets possible.
With Nvidia’s business tendrils come uncommonly strong and still-building growth trends. These trends should continue to support investors for a long-time to come and well beyond today’s $474 billion valuation.
A Closer Look at NVDA Stock
Nvidia’s most recent quarterly report card in late May was a standout and reflects today’s, as well as tomorrow’s momentum for the chip maker.
The company toppled street forecasts on earnings and revenue beats reflecting year-over-year growth of 103% and 84% respectively for its first quarter. That’s not all though.
Management also offered an above-views sales forecast of $6.30 billion for NVDA stock’s Q2. Not only does that compare favorably to analyst views of $5.5 billion, but it also reflects estimated growth of more 63% relative to 2020.
Deservedly, CEO Jensen Huang acknowledged NVDA’s fantastic and record-breaking results and how “Nvidia continues to do impactful work to invent a better future.”
Today, while investors won’t be the first to recognize NVDA’s momentum off and on the price chart, those friendly trends are still worth the price of admission.
NVDA Stock Monthly Price Chart

Source: Charts by TradingView
If there’s one word right now to best describe NVDA stock’s price action it’s momentum. Since confirming its uptrend in March out of a slightly challenging triangle chalked up to broader market “risk-off” conditions, shares are up a whopping 63%.
Nvidia’s performance stands alone in other ways within the semiconductor universe as well. Three straight months of gains have allowed NVDA to add 45% on the year, wildly outperform its peers and continue setting fresh all-time-highs .
The type of momentum fueling NVDA stock does come with a price though. When the music stops, investors should be prepared for a larger correction to emerge.
It happens to the best of them. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), no one stock is immune, not even NVDA.
Today Nvidia is pressing through its upper Bollinger Band and towards a functional trendline I’ve drawn in. Both are positioned as obvious tests of NVDA’s momentum.
But with stochastics just now signaling a bullish crossover beneath overbought territory and given Nvidia’s recent history of fighting successfully through overbought conditions, I wouldn’t fight the trend.
The Bottom Line
Long exposure to NVDA stock makes sense.
To better prepare for inevitable downside risk (which could be as large as 30%) I’d suggest either a slightly out-of-the-money bull call spread or similar NVDA stock collar. This is best for larger investment accounts which intend to make the chip giant a core growth holding in their portfolio.

NEW DELHI, June 24 (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc's GOOGL.O Google is forging a cloud partnership with India's Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd, helping the country's biggest wireless carrier with tech solutions for its enterprise and consumer offerings as it plans to launch 5G services.
The tie-up lends Jio the expertise of a global tech giant as it expands digital services to small and medium businesses as well as hundreds of millions of individual customers. And it gives Google the unmatched scale of Reliance whose new-age businesses range from telecoms to e-commerce.
Jio is part of tycoon billionaire Mukesh Ambani's oil-to-retail conglomerate Reliance Industries RELI.NS.
""It's a broad partnership, it involves multiple pieces of Alphabet working together,"" Thomas Kurian, Chief Executive Officer at Google Cloud, told Reuters in an interview ahead of Reliance's annual shareholders meeting on Thursday.
""Our own partnership spans multiple parts of Jio not just the communications business... but also health, retail and other things. And it allows us to bring our technology to many consumers in India in a broad-scale basis as well as to many businesses that are served by Reliance.""
While Google is working with other telecoms firms on 5G around the world, the scale of the Jio-Google cloud partnership is among the biggest for the California-headquartered company globally, said Kurian.
He declined to share the terms of the cloud contract with Jio.
Jio established a 10-year alliance with Microsoft Corp MSFT.O in 2019, aiming to build data centres across India that will be hosted on Azure cloud in a bid to offer services to the country's booming start-up economy.
Jio disrupted India's telecoms market in 2016 when it launched with cut-price data plans and free voice services. It forced several competitors out of the market and is now India's biggest mobile carrier with more than 422 million customers.
Google last year invested $4.5 billion in Jio's parent Jio Platforms, a move that landed the U.S. tech giant a rare board seat alongside rival Facebook FB.O which has also pumped $5.7 billion into the digital unit.
Ambani has previously said Jio, which also counts Qualcomm Inc QCOM.O and Intel Corp INTC.O among its backers, would ""pioneer the 5G revolution"" in India in 2021.

2021-06-23 00:00:00+00:00,Intel vs. Micron: Which Semiconductor Stock Is Primed For Upside In 2021?,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intel-vs.-micron%3A-which-semiconductor-stock-is-primed-for-upside-in-2021-2021-06-23,,,"Semiconductors are increasingly being used in different applications, including 5G, data centers, Internet of Things (IoT), mobiles and automotive applications.
According to a Fortune Business Insights report, while the semiconductor market was worth $425.96 billion last year, it is expected to grow to $803.15 billion in 2028. This indicates a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8.6% between 2021 and 2028.
Using the TipRanks Stock Comparison tool, let us compare two semiconductor companies, Intel and Micron Technology, and see how Wall Street analysts feel about these stocks.
Intel (NASDAQ: INTC)
Intel’s operating segments include data center group, IoT, Mobileye, Non-volatile memory solutions group (NSG), Programmable solutions group (PSG) and Client Computing Group (CCG).
INTC’s products include processors that power PCs, a standalone system-on-a-chip (SoC), a multichip package and memory and storage products.
In Q1, Intel reported adjusted earnings of $1.39 per share, a decline of 1% year-over-year, while revenue remained flat at $18.6 billion. The company also saw a new CEO, Pat Gelsinger, at its helm in mid-February.
The new CEO has proposed an investment of as much as $20 billion into two new chip manufacturing facilities in Arizona. He dubbed this strategic move as one which will reinvent the company. In his words, “Intel is back. The old Intel is now the new Intel.”
For 2Q, Intel expects adjusted revenue of $17.8 billion and non-GAAP earnings is expected to be $1.05 per share. In FY21, the company has forecast adjusted revenue and non-GAAP earnings to be $72.5 billion and $4.60 per share, respectively.
Intel expects data center revenues to rise in the second quarter, with demand rising in the second half of this year as “both cloud enterprise and government segments returned to growth.” In FY21, the company foresees a strong demand for PCs and expects that its total addressable market (TAM) and internal supply of PCs will both grow in the double digits year-over-year.
The company is optimistic about its third-generation Intel Xeon Scalable processor, named Ice Lake, “which offers nearly 50% gen-over-gen performance improvements across a range of workloads."" Currently, Intel is shipping Ice Lake processors to around 30 customers, including major cloud providers, communication service providers, enterprise and high-performance computing (HPC) customers.
However, Intel expects revenue for Intel's Client Computing Group (CCG) to “be more first half-weighted than normal seasonality” as a result of supply constraints in the industry and a decline in demand for modems and Apple (AAPL) Mac computers powered by Intel processors.
Yesterday, Intel announced a couple of changes to its business units. The company’s Data Platform Group (DPG) will be split into two new business units: Datacenter and AI, and Network and Edge Group. (See Intel stock chart on TipRanks)
Additionally, INTC also announced the creation of two new business units, with one, the Software and Advanced Technology group, focused on software. The other, the Accelerated Computing Systems and Graphics Group, will focus on high performance computing (HPC) and graphics.
Following the announcement, Mizuho Securities analyst Vijay Rakesh reiterated a Buy with a price target of $72 (28.87% upside) on the stock. Rakesh commented on the changes, “We believe the changes sharpen and add accountability to execution in key focus markets from GPUs to Datacenter/AI to Networking.”
The analyst views positive trends for the stock including “1) Enterprise rebound, 2) better Ice Lake availability, and 3) above-consensus PC Notebook ramps.”
Consensus among analysts on Wall Street is a Hold based on 11 Buys, 11 Holds, and 7 Sells. The average Intel analyst price target of $64.80 implies approximately 16% upside potential to current levels.
Micron Technology (NASDAQ: MU)
Micron Technology has a portfolio of memory and storage products including DRAM, NAND, and NOR products through the Micron and Crucial brands. The company reported revenues of $6.24 billion in Q2, up by around 30% year-over-year, with diluted earnings of $0.53 per share versus $0.36 per share in the same quarter last year.
Micron is expected to report its fiscal third quarter results on June 30. The company expects revenues of $7.1 billion in Q3 that could vary by $200 million, while the forecast for diluted earnings is $1.52 per share, which is expected to increase or decrease by $0.07 per share.
The company admitted at its fiscal second quarterearnings callthat the DRAM market is facing severe shortages, while the NAND market appears to be stabilizing in the short term. The company said that it will continue to monitor the DRAM situation closely.
Earlier this month, Rosenblatt Securities analyst Hans Mosesmann reiterated a Buy with a price target of $165 on the stock. Mosesmann said about the DRAM prices, “In terms of contract DRAM prices, our checks conclude prices are set for double-digit growth in Q3 generally, and likely another double-digit move up in Q4 driven by infrastructure end-markets.”
The production of Micron’s 1-alpha DRAM and 176-layer NAND nodes is increasing in volume and the company expects these nodes to be its key products in FY22. Micron expects robust demand from hyperscale customers in the United States in the second half of this year for its cloud DRAM bit shipments.
Mosesmann mentioned in the research report that the DRAM chips are pivotal for data centers, 5G broadband, automotive uses, and wireless technologies. Without memory growth in the semiconductors, these industries can not scale. 
Micron said at itsearnings callthat it expects bit growth for DRAM this year at 20%. The company’s President and CEO, Sanjay Mehrotra added, “As a result of the strong demand and limited supply, the DRAM market is currently facing a severe undersupply, which is causing DRAM prices to increase rapidly. We see the DRAM market tightening further through the year.” (See Micron stock chart on TipRanks)
When it comes to NAND products, the company expects bit growth in the low to mid-30% range this year. Over the long term, MU anticipates a bit demand compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) for DRAM in the mid-to-high teens, while for NAND it is expected to be around 30%.
Mehrotra stated at Micron’s Q2earnings call “In both DRAM and NAND, we expect our calendar 2021 bit supply growth to be below the industry demand growth, and we have used our inventory to add to our bit shipment growth this year. We are targeting fiscal 2021 CapEx to be approximately $9 billion to support our long-term goal of maintaining a stable share of industry bit supply.”
Consensus among analysts on Wall Street is a Strong Buy based on 17 Buys and 4 Holds. The average analyst Micron price target of $118 implies approximately 51.9% upside potential to current levels.
Bottom Line
While analysts are sidelined on Intel, they are bullish about Micron. According to analyst Vijay Rakesh, Intel could be at risk from a PC market that is maturing quickly and a difficult comparison in the tablet market along with “limited traction” in the wireless market.
Meanwhile, Mosesmann believes that while the memory industry is cyclical, and Micron is in a better competitive position with its products, any delay in product releases could result in the company’s customers moving to its competitors. That would result in financial pressure on the company.
Based on the upside potential over the next 12 months, Micron seems a better Buy.

Lavender, McKeown, Koduri, and Rivera will report directly to CEO Pat Gelsinger. Executive vice-president and general manager of the Data Platforms Group Navin Shenoy will help in the transition before leaving on July 6.
Atlantic Equities analyst Ianjit Bhatti recently downgraded his rating on the stock to Sell from Neutral and trimmed the price target from $63 to $45 (19.5% downside potential).
Bhatti said Intel’s revised IDM 2.0 manufacturing strategy may be the best long-term strategy, but it will have a negative impact on the company’s profitability until at least 2025.
Overall, the stock has a Hold rating based on 11 Buys, 11 Holds, and 7 Sells. The average Intel analyst price target of $64.80 implies 15.98% upside potential from current levels. The company’s shares have gained 12.5% year-to-date.

2021-06-22 00:00:00+00:00,These Tech Stocks Will Benefit As The Fed's Advances Rate Hike Timeline,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/these-tech-stocks-will-benefit-as-the-feds-advances-rate-hike-timeline-2021-06-23,,,"Our theme of Value Tech Stocks is up by about 13% year-to-date, compared to the Nasdaq-100 which is up by just about 11%. Although this doesn’t really count as meaningful outperformance, we see multiple catalysts for the theme in the medium to long term. Firstly, the Federal Reserve signaled that it expected to raise interest rates in 2023, ahead of the previous 2024 timeline, as the U.S. economy rebounds quickly from the impact of Covid-19, with inflation also heating up. Higher rates make investors prioritize near-term profits (that value tech stocks deliver) over long-term growth, potentially resulting in a rotation from growth stocks to value names. Secondly, many of the companies in the theme are mature tech names and should stand to benefit from increased corporate IT budgets after a relatively muted 2020.
Cybersecurity major NortonLifeLock (NLOK) has been the strongest performer within our theme, with its stock up by about 29% year-to-date, driven by higher demand for the company’s software, following the recent high-profile cyber attacks.  On the other hand, Fortive (FTV), a diversified technology company, has seen its stock decline by about 3% year-to-date.
[Updated 6/3/2021] Value Tech Stocks
Our theme of Value Tech Stocks is up by about 16% year-to-date, significantly outperforming the Nasdaq-100 index which is just about 8% higher over the same period. The theme is comprised of large-cap technology stocks that trade at a trailing price to earnings multiple of under 20x. We think the outperformance is likely to continue for a couple of reasons. Firstly, inflation has been trending higher globally and this could cause Central banks to re-think their stance on ultra-low interest rates. This should cause investors to continue rotating out of growth stocks into value stocks.  Moreover, most of the companies in our theme are mature tech names and should remain a play on increasing digitization of the economy following Covid-19.
Cybersecurity player NortonLifeLock (NLOK) has been the strongest performer within our theme, with its stock up by about 37% year-to-date, driven by better than expected Q4 2021 results, which were driven by higher demand for the company’s software, following high-profile cyber attacks in recent quarters. The company also recently announced plans to carry out a $1.5 billion share repurchase program. eBay (EBAY) stock has also fared quite well, rising by around 26%, driven by higher interest in e-commerce through the pandemic. On the other hand, video game maker Electronic Arts (EA) has been the weakest performer, with its stock down by about 1.5% year-to-date.
[5/5/21] Which Value Tech Stock Should You Pick?
Our theme of Value Tech Stocks is up by about 10% year-to-date, compared to the Nasdaq-100 which is up by just about 5% over the same period. The theme includes stocks from the tech sector that have a market cap of over $10 billion, trading at a trailing price to earnings multiple of under 20x. With Covid-19 cases well off their highs in the U.S. and about a third of the U.S. population now fully vaccinated,  investors are moving away from high growth stocks and Covid-19 winners toward cyclical and value stocks. Moreover, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen says that interest rates may have to rise somewhat to keep the economy from overheating and this is another factor that could help value names. We think that value technology stocks, in particular, look attractive at this juncture, considering that they also play on the broader theme of digitization and higher corporate IT budgets post the pandemic. Below is a bit more about how the stocks in our theme have been faring.
Intel stock (NASDAQ:INTC) has been one of the strongest performers within our theme, rising by about 17% year-to-date, driven by strong semiconductor demand, large new investment plans in the foundry space, and some changes at the top management level. Cisco stock (NASDAQ:CSCO) is up by about 14% year-to-date, as enterprises are likely to increase spending on network infrastructure post the pandemic, with overall corporate IT budgets also likely to trend higher. eBay stock (NASDAQ: EBAY) is also up 14% year-to-date, as the company sees some tailwinds from the shift to e-commerce through Covid-19. However, the stock has come under pressure lately due to lighter than expected guidance for the current quarter. Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) has been the worst performer within our theme, with its stock declining by -3.5% year-to-date.
[3/8/21] Will Rising Bond Yields Help Value Tech Stocks?
Our theme of Value Tech Stocks includes technology names with a market cap of over $10 billion that are trading at a trailing P/E of under 20x.  Although the theme has underperformed since 2017, rising by just about 31%, compared to the Nasdaq-100, which has more than doubled over the period, it has fared better this year, rising 1.5% year-to-date compared to the Nasdaq-100 which is down by over 4%. There’s a good chance these stocks could continue to outperform in 2021, as rising bond yields take some sheen off higher growth names with investors potentially rotating into value stocks. For perspective, the 10-year Treasury yield has risen from around 1.1% to 1.6% in just about a month. Now, value tech stocks might hit the sweet spot in this market as they trade at reasonable valuations while playing on the broader Covid-19 theme of greater digitization and higher corporate IT spends. Moreover, most of the names in our theme are mature tech companies that are incumbents in their respective segments. Within our theme, Intel stock (NASDAQ:INTC) has been the strongest performer, rising by about 20% year-to-date driven by strong semiconductor demand and some top management changes. On the other side, Marvell (NASDAQ: MRVL) a company that develops and produces semiconductors and related technology has underperformed on account of mixed quarterly earnings, with its stock declining by about 13% year-to-date.
[2/22/2021] Will Tech’s Old Guard Beat The Market In 2021?
Our theme of Value Tech Stocks has underperformed the market in recent years, rising by just about 29% since the end of 2017, compared to the S&P 500 which is up by about 46% over the same period. The theme includes tech companies that offer essential technology products and services, have a market capitalization of over $10 billion, and trade at a trailing price to earnings multiple of under 20x. In comparison, the broader NASDAQ index trades at a much higher 40x trailing P/E. However, we believe that the stocks in our theme have lower price risk in the current market environment, and at the same time could offer reasonable upside from increasing digitization and higher corporate IT spends following Covid-19. Below is a bit more about the stocks in the theme and some trends that could help to drive them higher in the near-term.
Intel stock (NASDAQ:INTC) stock has been the best performer within our theme this year so far, rising by about 26% since early January, driven by stronger than expected Q4 results and guidance for the current quarter, and also due to the appointment of new CEO Pat Gelsinger. Moreover, demand for semiconductors has been strong across the board, with many end-markets facing chip shortages. Intel, with its sizable production capacity, should stand to gain.
Cisco stock (NASDAQ:CSCO)  is up by about 2% year-to-date. The company has been witnessing weaker demand for its networking gear as the Covid-19 pandemic caused customers to postpone deployments and also due to stronger competition. However, IT spending is expected to rebound sharply as the pandemic wanes and Cisco should be well poised to benefit. Additionally, Cisco’s pivot to a more software-centric model should also help the stock.
Oracle stock (NYSE:ORCL) stock is down by about -5.5% year-to-date. Although revenues have faced pressure in recent years as the hardware and services segments have taken a hit, the company’s cloud operations, particularly its public cloud business, could unlock a lot of value. During its most recent quarter, the company said that revenue from its Gen 2 cloud was up over 100% year-over-year. As the public cloud business continues to gain scale and the company provides more transparency, investors could potentially re-rate the stock higher.
[Updated 1/20/2021] Value Tech Stocks 
Our indicative theme of Value Tech Stocks includes relatively mature businesses that offer essential technology products and services and trade at reasonable valuations. Specifically, we have picked tech companies that are trading at a trailing price to earnings multiple of under 20x and have a market capitalization of over $10 billion. Although these stocks haven’t really rallied since our last update in November, with the Covid-19 vaccines roll out gathering steam globally, it’s likely only a matter of time before broader economic growth returns, helping value stocks, including reasonably priced technology names. Here’s a quick rundown of some value stocks in our Value tech stocks theme.
Intel (INTC) has been out of favor with investors due to increasing preference for lower-cost ARM-based chipsets and a delay in its rollout of its next-generation 7nm CPUs. However, the stock is up by about 16% year-to-date, as investors have a favorable view of Intel’s recently announced top management shakeup, which will see VMware CEO and former Intel CTO Pat Gelsinger succeed current Intel CEO, Bob Swan.
Cisco (CSCO) stock has also been listless as corporations paired back on spending on networking gear through the Covid-19 recession. However, IT spending is likely to rebound sharply over 2021 and Cisco being the go-to company for enterprise networking solutions should benefit. The company’s gradual pivoting to a more software-driven model should also help the stock. The stock is up by about 1.5% this year.
Oracle (ORCL) is a provider of database, cloud, and enterprise software products. The stock has seen steady growth over the last several years, driven by expanding earnings and its share repurchase program. The company has been expanding sales of its cloud-based applications, such as Fusion and enterprise resourcing planning services, helping to offset the slow growth of its legacy offerings. The stock is down by about -4.5% this year.
NetApp (NTAP) is a company that sells hardware and software focused on data management. While the company has seen a mixed performance in recent quarters, due to weak demand from large customers and its significant reliance on hardware sales, its increasing focus on the cloud computing market should help the stock. The stock is down 2.5% year to date.
[ Updated 11/24/2020] Is it A Good Time To Double Down On Value Tech Stocks?
Value Tech Stocks such as Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) have had a mixed year. There was good reason for this, as the deep Covid-19 recession, abundant liquidity following interest rate cuts, and the growing at-home economy drove investors to hyper-growth software as service stocks, high-risk, high reward sectors such as electric vehicles, and fast-growing platform players such as Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).
However, with the availability of multiple highly effective Covid-19 vaccines (Pfizer, Moderna, and AstraZeneca have published strong efficacy data on their vaccines) looking likely in 2021, things are likely to gradually start returning to normal. Moreover, the Fed could also eventually revisit its stance on ultra-low interest rates as the economy shows signs of picking up.  As this plays out investors could re-visit lower growth stocks that represent compelling value. While positive news about the vaccine earlier this month has already buoyed cyclical sectors such as energy, industrials, and financials we think it’s likely that funds will flow to value tech stocks in the near-to-medium term.
Our indicative theme of Value Tech Stocks includes relatively mature businesses that offer essential technology products and services and trade at reasonable valuations. Specifically, we have picked companies that are trading at a trailing price to earnings multiple of under 18x and have a market capitalization of over $10 billion. Key names in the theme include Oracle (ORCL) , VMware Inc (VMW), Seagate Technology (STX), Cisco (CSCO), and Intel (INTC).
[Updated 11/10/2020] Can Intel Stock Recover?
Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) stock has had a rough year, driven by delays in the company’s transition to the next generation 7-nano meter technology for its chips, some recent headwinds at its cloud and data center business, and strong competition from rival AMD in the PC and server CPU space. The stock is down by about 25% this year, significantly underperforming the NASDAQ which is up by over 28%. That said, there have been some positive developments that could help the company get back on track. In October, Intel announced a deal to sell its NAND business to SK Hynix for about $9 billion in a move that could allow the company to focus on its core CPU business, while bolstering its liquidity. Intel also appears to be more flexible with its manufacturing, recently noting that it could produce its next-gen chips in-house, or outsource them, or even use a hybrid model that leverages both internal and external fabs. Intel stock looks like good value at the moment, trading at just about 9.5x projected 2020 earnings. While growth could remain tepid in the near-term, Intel’s scale, its vast marketing and distribution footprint, and its large base of corporate customers, who rely on Intel processors and are likely averse to switching, should help the company in the medium to long-term.
See our indicative theme on Value Tech Stocks for a complete list of technology companies – including Intel, NetApp, and Oracle – that look like good value at the moment. The theme has underperformed this year, remaining roughly flat year-to-date, versus the S&P 500 which is up by about 10%.
[Updated 9/3/2020] Value Tech Stocks
While high-growth information technology stocks have rallied sharply this year, with valuations looking increasingly stretched, we’ve picked a few stocks including Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), and NetApp (NASDAQ:NTAP) that have relatively stable and mature businesses and still offer good value. Specifically, we have picked companies that are trading at a trailing price to earnings multiple of under 18x and have a market capitalization of over $10 billion. See our analysis Value Tech Stocks for more details on the returns and performance of these stocks. Parts of the analysis are summarized below.
Intel ($215 billion market cap, -15% YTD), the largest CPU vendor has been somewhat out of favor with investors on account of increasing competition from lower-cost ARM-based chipsets and the company’s delay in its rollout of its next-generation 7nm CPUs. However, Intel looks like good value considering its large base of existing customers, who rely on Intel processors and are likely averse to switch and also due to its vast marketing and distribution footprint. The stock trades at about 11x 2019 earnings.
Cisco ($178 billion market cap, -10% YTD), one of the largest network equipment providers, has also underperformed the market as it has struggled with top-line and bottom-line growth. However, the increasing digitization caused by the Covid-19 pandemic could drive demand for connectivity, in turn improving sales of Cisco’s networking software, and products such as switches and routers. The stock trades at about 16x FY’19 earnings.
NetApp ($10 billion market cap, -25% YTD) is a company that sells hardware and software focused on data management. While the company has seen a mixed performance this year due to weak demand from large customers and its significant reliance on hardware sales, it is looking to double down on the cloud computing market. Last month, NetApp closed a deal to acquire Spot, a leader in compute management, and cost optimization for public clouds. The stock currently trades at about 13x last fiscal year earnings.

2021-06-22 00:00:00+00:00,"3 PC Stocks That Turned $10,000 Into Millions",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-pc-stocks-that-turned-%2410000-into-millions-2021-06-22,,,"Personal computer companies have at times served as some of the best wealth creators in Wall Street history. These businesses started small, building themselves around a product that they felt would change the world -- and it did.
In the decades since the birth of the PC, most of the companies in that segment have shifted their focus away from those devices. Nonetheless, the visions exhibited by Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) not only brought technology to the home user but also made some early small-scale investors millions of dollars.
1. Apple
Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak founded Apple in 1976 in a garage in Los Altos, California. The startup spent the 1970s refining its original PC design before going public in December 1980 at $22 per share. At that IPO price, a $10,000 stake bought 454 shares.
Image source: Getty Images.
The impact of Apple's five stock splits between 1987 and 2020 would adjust that initial price to just under $0.10 per share, and give someone who invested $10,000 a share count of 101,696. At today's price of about $130 per share, that investment would be worth more than $13.2 million.
However, Jobs left the company in 1985, and it was flirting with bankruptcy by the time he returned in 1997. Hence, practically all of Apple's net stock gains occurred after that time. Although Jobs revived the company initially with the iMac, he drove it to most of its growth by taking the focus away from its Macintosh line of personal computers. The popularity of products such as the iPod and ultimately the iPhone would further de-emphasize the role of personal computers at Apple.
The company's success also helped to spark a change in attitude at Berkshire Hathaway. Its innovations and earnings growth turned CEO Warren Buffett -- who previously avoided investing in the tech sector -- into a fan. Today, Apple is the largest stock holding in Buffett's portfolio.
2. Intel
PCs didn't even exist when Gordon Moore and Robert Noyce founded Intel in 1968. Early in its history, it created the world's first microprocessor, the Intel 4004. That innovation made it possible for smaller machines such as PCs to perform functions that previously required much larger hardware.
Building on the microprocessor, Intel went public in October 1971 at $23.50 per share. At that IPO price, $10,000 would have bought 425 shares. Factor in the 13 stock splits Intel has undergone since then, and the effective IPO price drops to about $0.02 per share and the original 425 shares become 494,400 shares (assuming one subtracts away the fractional shares left after each split). At the current price of about $57 per share, that $10,000 initial investment would hold a value of just under $28.2 million.
Practically all of those gains occurred in the 20th century. Intel stock =today is trading below its 2000 high, and the company hasn't initiated a stock split since 2000. Since the decline of the PC, Intel has lost its technical lead to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing. However, it has attempted a comeback in recent years by designing chips for data centers, self-driving cars, and other applications, and it remains one of the world's largest semiconductor companies.
3. Microsoft
Software, too, played a critical role in the PC's development. Bill Gates and Paul Allen recognized early on that this would be the case, and founded Microsoft in 1975 to compete in that arena. Nonetheless, their company would not enter the operating system business until 1980.
In November of that year, it contracted with IBM to provide MS-DOS as the operating system for the IBM PC, a deal that laid the foundations upon which it built its dominance around its operating systems.
Microsoft retained ownership and control of MS-DOS, which then became the most common operating system for the clone PCs built by many of IBM's competitors.
This growth eventually led Microsoft to an IPO in March 1986. The stock initially sold for $21 per share. At that price, $10,000 bought 476 shares. Its nine splits between 1987 and 2003 would drop that adjusted IPO price to just over $0.07 per share, and turn those original 476 shares into 137,088 (assuming the sale of fractional shares after the three-for-two splits). At the current price of about $257 per share, that initial $10,000 stake would now have a value of over $35.2 million.
Over time, Microsoft diversified into productivity software, gaming, search, and a host of other areas. However, following the decline of the PC, the company's cloud offerings led its recovery. The success of its cloud computing business has helped lift Microsoft stock nearly 1,000% higher over the last 10 years. According to Canalys, it lags only market leader Amazon in the cloud infrastructure market, fueling its continued success.
Takeaways
The tech world has largely moved beyond its focus on personal computers, and today's investors should not expect modest investments in PC stocks to turn them into millionaires.
Nonetheless, the rise of the PC helped play a role in developing new industries such as the internet, e-commerce, cloud computing, and streaming media. Consequently, $10,000 invested in the IPOs of related companies such as Amazon, Cisco, and Netflix turned more small investors into millionaires. Considering that progress, we likely have not seen the last growth tech stock that partially owes its success to the rise of the PC.

2021-06-22 00:00:00+00:00,"Chipmaker GlobalFoundries plans $6 bln expansion in Singapore, US, Germany",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/chipmaker-globalfoundries-plans-%246-bln-expansion-in-singapore-us-germany-2021-06-22,,,"By Aradhana Aravindan
SINGAPORE, June 22 (Reuters) - Chipmaker GlobalFoundries said on Tuesday it will spend $6 billion to expand capacity at its factories in Singapore, Germany and the United States amid a chip shortage that is hurting automakers and electronics firms globally.
The U.S.-based company, owned by Abu Dhabi's state-owned fund Mubadala MUDEV.UL, said it will invest more than $4 billion in Singapore, and $1 billion each in the others over the next two years. The unlisted company's Singapore operations contribute about a third of its revenue.
""I think the next five to eight years, we're going to be chasing supply not demand as an industry,"" GlobalFoundries CEO Thomas Caulfield told a media briefing. He added that the company was prioritising automotive customers.
Tuesday's expansion is in addition to the company's previously announced plan to invest $1.4 billion in 2021 alone to expand its manufacturing capacity.
The chip shortage, which began in earnest in late December, was caused in part by automakers miscalculating demand for semiconductors in the pandemic. It was aggravated by electronics manufacturers placing more chip orders as work-from-home practices fuelled a surge in sales of computers and other devices.
Large chipmakers including Intel Corp INTC.O have warned that the shortage will last well into next year. Intel announced in March a $20 billion plan to expand its advanced chip making capacity, while Taiwan's TSMC 2330.TW said in April it will invest $100 billion over the next three years.
As well, governments, including those of the United States and Japan, have intervened to urge faster supplies. Earlier this month, the United States approved $54 billion in funds to increase U.S. production and research into semiconductors and telecom equipment.
Caulfield said funding for GlobalFoundries' expansion plan included investments from governments and pre-payments from customers.
The $4 billion investment in Singapore is the first of a phased expansion programme planned by the company for the next five to 10 years, the CEO said. He did not specify a total amount.
The new Singapore fab will add capacity of 450,000 wafers per year, taking the campus's total to 1.5 million, and the company expects to begin production in early 2023. Most of the added production will come online by end 2023.
The factory will make chips for cars and 5G technology, with long-term customer agreements already in place. It will add about 1,000 jobs in Singapore.

2021-06-21 00:00:00+00:00,3 EVs Are the Most-Shorted Stocks to Buy,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-evs-are-the-most-shorted-stocks-to-buy-2021-06-21,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
A yellow light of sorts has lingered over much of Wall Street. But in a market also made up of heavily-shorted electric vehicle stocks, a red light in recent months has changed to flash a green buy signal. Let’s look at three of these most-shorted stocks price charts and offer investors, well-aligned strategies for safer passage.
Blame it on what you will. And for many investors riding the major averages to all-time-highs and solid year-to-date returns, fingers are pointed at public enemy No. 1, Jay Powell and Fed regulators, following hawkish-sounding testimony on interest rate policy midweek.
Inching toward Friday’s closing bell, the Dow was in pole position for the bears. Led by losses in Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Walgreens Boots Alliance (NYSE:WBA), the venerable blue-chip barometer WAS set finish the week lower by 3.25% and matching its worst five session stretch since late January.
8 High-Risk Stocks to Buy That Are Worth Taking a Chance On
Don’t feel too bad for those market bulls, at least not yet. The Dow Jones is still up a historically robust 9% in 2021. And mind you, the index is only 5% off its recent all-time-high of 35,091 set last month. The same, of course, can’t be said for many of the market’s most-shorted stocks.
Blink Charging (NASDAQ:BLNK)
Workhorse Group (NASDAQ:WKHS)
Romeo Power (NYSE:RMO)
Looking ahead and at many already crashed EVs and now sporting confirmed corrective bottoming patterns, as well as a potentially powerful additive of high short interest, here are three of those most-shorted stocks revving to deliver profits.
Most-Shorted Stocks to Buy: Blink Charging (BLNK)

Source: Charts by TradingView
The first of our most-shorted stocks to buy are shares of Blink Charging. BLNK stock maintains short interest of nearly 35%. That figure has come in a couple basis points over the past month after Blink delivered a mixed, but well-received earnings report. The report featured sales growth of nearly 72% year-over-year and possibly triggered some shorts to cover.
Today and technically, the price action in BLNK has resulted in shares forming a healthy-looking corrective double-bottom pattern. The monthly view reveals May’s hammer pivot candlestick has been confirmed. As well, there’s a flattening stochastics in neutral territory. This is teasing a bullish crossover for investors be upbeat about.
The observation is this most-shorted stock has enough evidence in place for a purchase. But to make for a more secure buy of BLNK stock, an August $35/$50 collar is an alternative route to manage risk more smartly, off and on the price chart.
Workhorse Group (WKHS)

Source: Charts by TradingView
Workhorse Group is the next of our most-shorted stocks to buy. After losing out on a very well-publicized U.S. Postal Service deal for the mail carrier’s Next Generation Delivery Vehicles (NGDVs) in late February, shares of WKHS took a massive hit of nearly 50% in a single session.
It wasn’t without just cause either.
A lot was riding on a partnership which ultimately landed in the lap of Oshkosh (NYSE:OSK). WKHS enjoyed a mid-cap valuation and reached all-time-highs in anticipation of a massive $482 million initial order and contract to deliver 50,000 to 165,000 NGDV’s over the next decade.
But today’s WKHS stock is suggesting there may be life after the disappointment. Eternal life as an ongoing business entity? That’s highly unlikely, according to InvestorPlace’s Luke Lango. And I respect his two-cents on this most-shorted stock. Still, today’s price chart trumps longevity worries for a shorter-term bottoming play. This might continue to squeeze WKHS’s bear population of around 40%.
Technically, the provided monthly chart shows Workhorse shares have confirmed a monthly candlestick bottom. Reinforcing that bullish feature, WKHS has also reversed back through its former highs from 2016 and this most-shorted stock’s 76% retracement level tied to its March pandemic bottom.
8 High-Risk Stocks to Buy That Are Worth Taking a Chance On
Along with an oversold stochastics oversold on the cusp of a bullish crossover, I wouldn’t back up the truck – or umm a Workhorse van – on this trade. However, an August $17/$21 bull call spread is a well-priced, albeit slightly more speculative opportunity that has the goods to deliver.
Most-Shorted Stocks to Buy: Romeo Power (RMO)

Source: Charts by TradingView
The last of our EVs most-shorted stocks to buy is Romeo Power. The outfit is an electric battery supplier that’s fallen off the radar for investors other than RMO stock’s short interest of about 24%. And with shares careening off course this year by 62%, the group has made hay of their own to be sure.
Today though, this may be a most-shorted stock for bulls to consider backing up the truck on.
As best as we can tell, an attractive battery deal with commercial rig manufacturer PACCAR (NASDAQ:PCAR) announced this past spring has taken a backseat to supply chain worries which could hurt production schedules and fail to accommodate end-user demand.
While unnerving, the good news is it’s not as if bulls and bears have been blind to the situation. Again, RMO stock is off 62%. What’s more and today, shares are showing indications of bottoming on the price chart.
Right now, RMO is idling near levels associated with a monthly chart corrective hammer doji formed off all-time-lows that was recently confirmed. Also this most-shorted stock is now signaling a bullish stochastics crossover. This is hinting the road ahead for investors could be a more pleasant ride.
To better prepare for “keep on trucking” price action in RMO and a bullish trend to emerge, I’d suggest an August $9/$12.5 collar for profitable upside, while avoiding the possibility of being a crash-test dummy.

2021-06-21 00:00:00+00:00,Intel to work with India's Reliance Jio on 5G network technology,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intel-to-work-with-indias-reliance-jio-on-5g-network-technology-2021-06-21,,,"By Stephen Nellis
June 21 (Reuters) - Intel Corp INTC.O on Monday said it will work with India's Reliance Jio to develop 5G networking technology.
Intel's venture capital unit last year invested $250 million in Reliance Industries Ltd's RELI.NS Jio Platforms unit, saying the two companies would find areas of technology partnership. On Monday, Intel said it will work on ""co-innovations"" with Reliance Jio for its 5G radio-access network (RAN), among other things.
""This is the fruit of that partnership,"" Navin Shenoy, executive vice president and general manager of the data platforms group at Intel, told Reuters in an interview. ""5G in India is going to be massive, and (Reliance Jio) are doing it in a non-legacy way.""
Reliance Jio is one of many carriers around the world using a new approach to build 5G networks. Rather than using gear primarily from telecommunications-specific firms such as Nokia NOKIA.HE, Ericsson ERICb.ST or Huawei Technologies Cos HWT.UL, carriers are shifting toward using software to handle more network functions and tapping the same kind of standard computing equipment used in data centers to run the networks.
Intel, for its part, has been losing share in its core data center and personal computing markets to rivals such as Advanced Micro Devices Inc AMD.O after years of manufacturing troubles. But networking chips have become an increasingly important part of its business, growing 20% in 2020 to account for $6 billion of its $77.9 billion in overall sales.
Dan Rodriguez, general manager of Intel's network platforms group, said part of that growth has come from Intel's decision nearly a decade ago to invest in software akin to an operating system for its network chips. The system, called FlexRAN, lets carriers or software firms write code for 5G networks.
Intel said Monday that software from Cohere Technologies could double utilization of some network spectrum using Intel's chips, benefiting carriers that spend billions acquiring spectrum rights.

Today is record day for the 4-for-1 stock split of shares of Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock. If you’d purchased and held NVDA stock from my June 9 recommendation at $700 a share, you’d be sitting with a 6.42% gain and the promised of four times as many shares come mid July.

NVDA stock hit $610 in February this year and dipped to $500 in March. It hit an all-time high of $721 on June 14 and closed Friday at $745 per share.
One cannot predict the stock movement after the split but Nvidia is one company that has the ability to scale and generate massive revenue in the coming months. The stock split will not have an impact on the fundamentals of the company.

8 High-Risk Stocks to Buy That Are Worth Taking a Chance On
Let us take a look at an important catalyst in the growth of Nvidia.
NVDA Stock Fueled by Faster Chips
The company’s graphics processing units have become the gold standard for gaming. There is an increase in the use of artificial intelligence which is increasing the demand for faster chips. The company strives to provide AI and data science solutions for every industry. 
Nvidia has entered the world of data centers with its GPU accelerators. The data center business exceeded sales of $2 billion for the first time and it is up 79% year over year. Data centers are an important aspect of various businesses and Nvidia unveiled a data processing unit bang in time.
This unit will replace the traditional CPUs. Additionally, the company also announced Grace, a CPU that is designed to pair with the GPUs and is built for applications including AI. This sector was previously dominated by Intel Corp. (NASDAQ:INTC) but Nvidia made the right moves at the right time. 
Nvidia is ahead of its time and it has already proved that the gaming industry is not the only one that will need AI technology. It is constantly expanding from manufacturing to electric vehicles and telecommunication.
When it comes to AI, there is ample opportunity for the company to grow and the sales are only going to increase in the coming quarters. We should expect higher contribution of the data centers towards the revenue of the company. 
Nvidia is not just a company that is known for GPUs, it has made strong moves into the world of cryptocurrency and has a lot more to offer on the business model.
Timely Expansion in the Autonomous Vehicle Industry
Nvidia recently announced the acquisition of DeepMap, a startup that builds maps for autonomous vehicles. This acquisition is made right in time when the world is moving to AVs. It will help Nvidia bring the best technology to the table. AVs offer higher precision and this acquisition will allow the company to scale across its AV fleets. 
NVIDIA Drive is an end-to-end platform that provides neural network training in the data center. With this acquisition, Nvidia will be able to offer the best mapping and localization capabilities on DRIVE and ensure that the vehicles are a notch better than the others in the industry. 
Nvidia’s Become a Forever-Hold Stock
Whether you are keen on the stock split or not, NVDA stock is one to hold forever. 
The stock might become attractive after the stock split and could attract more investors. The fundamentals of the company are strong and the future looks bright.
The company is ready to become one of the biggest tech companies in the near future. NVDA stock could hit new highs in the future and with its business model and offerings, the sky is the limit.
Buy NVDA stock and hold it forever.

Investors have different timelines, so there isn’t one entry point or decision to fit everyone the same.
My beef with it now is that the stock has been so relentless for too long. The easy bullish setup is over, and this week’s burst sealed the deal. Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) stock price range makes more sense.
Today I am calling for a bit of self-control. Investors that are not yet long NVDA stock should know that they missed the easy trade. The hard part is to be patient for re-entry lower.

This doesn’t mean that I can short it, but I must temper my enthusiasm for new positions. I completely understand long-term investors not caring so much about timing. If that’s the case then waiting a few more ticks shouldn’t matter either. My main concern is first to avoid potentially bad entries. An incline as steep as this one qualifies as a potential trap.
When great stocks spike their relative valuation changes with extreme altitudes. Currently, Nvidia management placed itself in a leading role among the top three chip manufacturers. AMD comes in a close second and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is dragging third. This affords NVDA stock a premium but the differential has grown way too big.
Relative Value to AMD Makes NVDA Expensive
When I say expensive, I don’t mean that I want it to be cheap. This is a growth company so value is not what I seek. However, NVDA now has a hefty 60 price-to-sales ratio, three times more expensive than AMD, and they are both delivering the same growth.
If you force me to chose which to buy, I would opt for AMD for that reason. The easiest way to say it is that this is not an obvious point of entry in NVDA stock.
There is also risk from the overall market. The indices are still breaking records but largely thanks to artificial infusions from the government. The Federal Reserve has had the spigots open full-bore for years. This week they hinted at the possibility of winding it down.
When that happens it will leave a void worth $1.4 trillion a year from asset purchases. The White House stimuli that are three times bigger are also winding down.
The reflation efforts have goosed the stock market and created hyperinflation situations. I use this “hyperinflation” term on purpose because it recently made headlines on CNBC. I’m not from Wall Street, yet my measurement of inflation is certainly more accurate than the CPI they publish.
I know the carton of milk I buy at Costco is 50% more expensive than it was pre-pandemic. Almost everything now has never been more expensive. Houses, cars and even food. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell called it “transitory” and I’d like to see what would unwind it lower.
Circling back to NVDA it is definitely a BUY in my book but on dips. It broke out from $650 per share. Arguably this even started $50 lower, but the target is closer to $800 per share.
Investors who have missed the entry here should set their alerts to buy the dip when it happens. I am confident that this year we will have that chance. A general correction of equities will drag down the good stocks too. Those that have rallied this far have the most to give back.
There Are Better Levels for NVDA Stock Buys
Source: Charts by TradingView
After a breakout, stock prices often revisit the necklines. For NVDA that’s at or below $625 per share. There should be very strong support waiting for it there.
The stock has consolidated in a very wide range since last September. Those who want to short the stock now should book profits quickly. I don’t see a scenario where this stock completely falls apart alone. If the market crashes massively, then the gift of the century would be to by it below $480.
If I can’t wait that long then I can do it now with options. Instead of buying shares I can sell the NVDA December $480 put and collect $8 per contract. This means that the stock can fall 35% and I can still profit.
Committing to owning shares that much lower is safer than risking $746 per share right here. Regardless of the method, investors should only take partial positions so they can manage the risk over time.
I will end this how I started by saying that I am a fan of the company. But I don’t like chasing it at these altitudes even if I miss some upside. Patience will reward investors in the long run.

2021-06-21 00:00:00+00:00,Intel Courted by German State for Chip Factory Rights – Report,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intel-courted-by-german-state-for-chip-factory-rights-report-2021-06-21,,,"According to Reuters, Germany’s southern state, Bavaria, has turned to Intel (INTC) as it looks to counter chip supply shortages that have derailed production in the automotive sector. Officials are looking to sway the chip giant to establish its proposed European factory in the state.
The state has already offered the Penzing-Landsberg airbase as a potential site for the proposed semiconductor factory. Intel is seeking up to $9.5 billion in public incentives to establish its factory in the region, reports Reuters. (See Intel stock chart on TipRanks)
""I strongly support this…The possible location of a large international semiconductor manufacturer in Bavaria is an outstanding opportunity,"" said Economy Minister Hubert Aiwanger.
Bavaria's push to have Intel set up base in the state does not come as a surprise, as it is home to luxury carmaker BMW. Additionally, it has suffered from chip shortages which threaten the car manufacturer's operations. Germany’s economy is also under pressure, given the slowdown in the auto industry.
The EU is pushing for the creation of an alliance of semiconductor companies in the region and sees an alliance as averting the risk of reliance on foreign semiconductor companies.
Citigroup analyst Christopher Danely recently reiterated a Hold rating on the stock with a $65 price target, implying 16.76% upside potential to current levels. According to the analyst, a month-over-month decline in May notebook shipments represents a negative data point. The analyst views the decline as more “bad news” for the chip giant.
Consensus among analysts is a Hold based on 12 Buys, 11 Holds, and 8 Sells. The Intel average analyst price target of $66.31 implies 19.11% upside potential to current levels.
INTC scores a “Perfect 10” on TipRanks’ Smart Score rating system, indicating that the stock has strong potential to outperform market expectations.

2021-06-20 00:00:00+00:00,3 Reasons to Avoid Taiwan Semiconductor Stock,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-reasons-to-avoid-taiwan-semiconductor-stock-2021-06-20,,,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) has powered its way to impressive returns, especially in the past couple of years. The willingness for fabless chip companies to outsource their chip manufacturing work to TSMC as well as a burgeoning technical lead the company has developed have both been beneficial to this semiconductor specialist.
However, investors may want to rethink opening new positions in this company's stock considering there are three notable dangers the company is facing. What dangers? Let's take a closer look.
1. TSMC's valuation is near a 10-year high
TSMC has generated significant investor returns by playing its part in powering a digital revolution. In the last year alone, the stock price has risen by almost 120%. Over 10 years, that return exceeds 810%.
Image source: Getty Images.
Rising profits continue to fuel this stock price increase. In the first quarter of 2021, net income surged 19%, driven largely by a 17% increase in revenue. That actually represented a decline as net income for fiscal 2020 rose 50% compared with 2019 levels. During that time, revenue climbed by 25%. Costs fell short of this level, with the cost of revenue increasing by 9% and operating costs surging by 21%.
Unfortunately, such increases have also taken the company's valuation close to 10-year highs. TSMC stock now sells for about 34 times earnings. In fairness, that still makes it much more reasonable than its client NVIDIA, which sells for around 85 times earnings. It also closely matches Advanced Micro Devices' P/E ratio of 35.
Still, this amounts to a significant increase from the 22 P/E ratio of one year ago or the 10 multiple it reached in 2015. Also, it should be noted that chipmakers that own fabs tend to maintain lower multiples. Texas Instruments (NASDAQ: TXN) sells at a 29 P/E ratio, while Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) trades for 13 times earnings.
2. Rising chip production could lower product pricing
Much of TSMC's profitability was driven by a chip shortage over the past year or so. While a lack of available chips brings favorable pricing in the near term, it also tends to prompt production increases. As semiconductor companies work off the shortage, chip prices will probably fall. This factor will cut into revenue growth at a time when capacity increases take its costs higher.
Nonetheless, many of the company's peers such as Samsung and Intel have pledged to expand fabs and build new ones. Also, TSMC has had to follow suit as it cannot meet the current demand. In the first-quarter 2021 earnings call, the company pledged to invest 100 billion New Taiwan dollars ($3.6 billion) over the next three years to add capacity.
TSMC will also receive some help with capacity increases with its fab under construction in Arizona, according to Bloomberg. Thanks in part to a subsidy, TSMC will manufacture 5-nanometer chips close to key U.S. customers, producing an estimated 20,000 chips per month.
3. Geopolitical issues could hurt TSMC
Unfortunately, the Arizona facility will account for less than 2% of TSMC's production, which amounted to 12.4 million wafers in 2020. This occurs at a time when foreign governments have become increasingly concerned about Taiwan becoming the Saudi Arabia of chip production. Taiwan currently accounts for 65% of the world's semiconductor manufacturing, according to TrendForce.
Like Saudi Arabia, Taiwan faces significant political turmoil, especially with China's renewed threats to reclaim what it considers its rogue ""province."" Such a risk infers that TSMC should trade at a discount.
Moreover, considering the economic and national security implications of such an event, the U.S. Senate has approved $52 billion in subsidies for America's chip industry. This will probably favor U.S. producers that own fabs such as Intel and TI.
Not only will the subsidy encourage the construction of fabs in the U.S., but it may also help companies like Intel regain a lost technological edge. For now, Intel will have to bridge a substantial gap. It stated that it will not deliver a 7nm chip to market until 2023, something TSMC first accomplished in 2018.
The bottom line
TSMC's technical lead amid a chip shortage and a rising stock price has made it a relatively expensive investment. This has occurred at a time when rising production will probably reduce its revenue per chip. It has also happened as foreign governments work to divert chip production away from Taiwan amid economic and geopolitical concerns. Considering these dangers, TSMC is a chip stock that investors may only want to consider if it's sold at a discount.

2021-06-19 00:00:00+00:00,NVIDIA: The Next Trillion Dollar Company?,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/nvidia%3A-the-next-trillion-dollar-company-2021-06-19,,,"In this video, I will be talking about NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) and why I believe it will become the next trillion-dollar company, and potentially one of the world's biggest and most important companies. The stock is up 40% year to date compared to its peers Intel (up 15%), which has been lagging behind in recent years, and AMD (down 9%), which has enjoyed hypergrowth in recent years. It's safe to say that NVIDIA isn't feeling the heat despite the global chip shortage concerns.
The business
NVIDIA reported Q1 revenue of $5.66 billion, up 84% year over year, while its diluted earnings per share climbed to a record $3.03, up 106%. Its core business is split into four segments: gaming, data centers, professional visualization, and automotive. The gaming segment makes up most of the company's revenue, with 47%. The data centers segment makes up 40% and is growing at a five-year compound annual rate of 82%. Professional visualization and automotive make up 6% and 3%, respectively. It's safe to say that all four segments will continue to grow as we make the transition to a completely digital world.
ARM acquisition
Back in September of 2020, NVIDIA announced that it will acquire Arm for $40 billion. But since then the potential deal has received a large amount of backlash from the semiconductor industry because Arm has long been a neutral player, licensing key intellectual property to customers who are otherwise rivals, such as Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM).
If the deal goes through, it will turn NVIDIA into one of the most important companies of the future. To put this into perspective, last year Arm (licensees) sold 22 billion chips and NVIDIA sold 100 million chips. NVIDIA's CEO Jensen Huang said:
We are buying Arm because we want to advance computing further. The future of computing is going to move further from the cloud to the edge. That is what Arm is fantastic at. Where we are fantastic is AI. So, imagine the possibilities in putting AI at the edge.
NVIDIA has until March 2022 to complete the deal and it has recently been reported that Qualcomm offered to invest in Arm if regulators block the $40 billion acquisition.
Cryptocurrency metaverse
NVIDIA is no stranger to the cryptocurrency world. According to Huang, we are moving toward a crypto metaverse. In February, NVIDIA released a graphics card for Ethereum miners called The NVIDIA CMP (Cryptocurrency Mining Processor). At the end of May, NVIDIA had made $155 million from its CMP cards. With NFTs gaining in popularity and VR becoming mainstream, there's no reason the cryptocurrency side of NVIDIA can't continue to grow.

Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is one of the biggest companies in the world, with a market cap of over $1.3 trillion as of April 2020. For several years, it has maintained a dominant position in its market. A big part of its success comes from innovating and becoming better with each quarter continuously. However, it is important to note that Apple supplier stocks have also done very well alongside AAPL.

10 Marijuana Stocks to Buy for Their 'Beyond the Flower' Plans
Here are 7 Apple supplier stocks every AAPL advocate needs to know:
Intel (NASDAQ:INTC)
Murata Manufacturing (OTCMKTS:MRAAY)
Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM)
Hon Hai Precision Industry (OTCMKTS:HNHPF)
Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS)
Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN)
Samsung Electronics (OTCMKTS:SSNLF)
Apple has more than 200 suppliers that help the company manufacture its signature products like the iPhone, iPad, Mac, iPod and Apple Watch. The companies we’ll discuss today are those best positioned to benefit from an Apple adjacent boost.
Apple Supplier Stocks: Intel (INTC)

Intel is involved in cloud computing, data centers, the Internet of Things and PC solutions.
In July 2019, Apple agreed to acquire the majority of Intel’s smartphone modem business. The purchase allowed the company to broaden its patent ownership and deploy a strong plan for 5G development.
But the relationship is tenuous. In November, Apple announced three new Mac computers: a MacBook Air, a 13-inch MacBook Pro and a Mac Mini. All of these computers are fitted with Apple’s own M1 chip instead of Intel processors.
Apple CEO Tim Cook has frequently said the company has a “long-term strategy of owning and controlling the primary technologies behind the products we make.” The move to Apple’s M1 chips is part of this initiative.
Nonetheless, Apple’s highest-end laptops are still Intel-based, so it isn’t like the 15-year partnership is coming to an end anytime soon.
Murata Manufacturing (MRAAY)

Japan’s Murata Manufacturing supplies parts to both Apple and Samsung. Apple specifically is supplied from 26 manufacturing facilities spread across Malaysia, Japan, Thailand, Vietnam, China and Singapore. In Japan, the company has 16 supplier sites.
Although this company isn’t a large conglomerate on par with Intel, it still benefits from having Apple and Samsung as its top two clients. Both of these major companies source ceramic capacitors used to control the flow of electricity in electronic devices.

Murata Manufacturing is hardly a household name in the U.S., but it has an extensive product suite that covers a wide array of electronic modules and components. That makes it one of the better Japanese stocks out there.
Qualcomm (QCOM)

Qualcomm is a world leader in semiconductor, mobile and telecom products and services. It supplies multiple components to Apple, including envelope power trackers, baseband processors, power management modules and GSM/CDMA receivers and transceivers.
The latest iPhones use 5G parts supplied from Qualcomm. Before this, Apple used Intel parts for a few years before purchasing that business unit from the chipmaker.
It’s important to note here that Apple has started building its own cellular modem for future devices.
Apple has been hiring engineers from Qualcomm to help it build the modem and has offices focusing on these efforts in San Diego, at its Cupertino, California headquarters as well as in Europe. But this shift will not happen overnight.
Hon Hai Precision Industry (HNHPF)

You might know Taiwan-based Hon Hai Precision Industry by its other name, Foxconn.
In the summer of 2017, the Taiwanese tech giant reached a market cap of over $138 billion, mainly due to its contracts for manufacturing Apple iPhones.
Nevertheless, that was a long time ago. Shares have lost a lot of steam and are trading slightly above $8 as I write this. This is despite consistent performance over the last five years and a net profit of $3.56 billion in 2020.

Foxconn relies on Apple for about half of its revenue. As with other iPhone suppliers, Hon Hai has been grappling with more expensive phones, since their compensation is based on the number of phones manufactured.
Skyworks Solutions (SWKS)

Skyworks manufactures semiconductors for use in Radio Frequency and mobile communications systems. Skyworks Solutions derives 56% of its revenue from Apple.
In April, Skyworks announced that the company was paying $2.75 billion to acquire an infrastructure and automotive business. The move is part of the company’s attempt to diversify its business away from Apple. It will expose such hot markets as electric vehicles, 5G equipment and data centers.
The acquisition brings with it operating margins of close to 40%. According to Karl Ackerman, a senior research analyst at Cowen, the acquisition will add about 5% to Skyworks’ per-share earnings by 2022.
Overall, the fundamentals are rock solid for this one. EPS and sales are up 56.7% and 34.4% on a TTM basis and the dividend yield is also very respectable at 1.2%.
Despite these excellent numbers, SWKS has underperformed the S&P 500 by 3.9% and its sector by 8.1% in the past year. But that should give investors even more incentive to snap this up at a discount.
Texas Instruments (TXN)

Texas Instruments is a semiconductor company that makes various products for an array of industries. TXN supplies components that help with processes around power management and battery charging in iPhones.
Apple typically announces and ships a new iPhone in September. Consequently, supplying the power-management component of this iconic brand is a major coup for Texas Instruments, which makes roughly 95% of its revenue from semiconductors and the remainder from its well-known calculators.
Even without its relationship with Apple, the company is a solid performer. On a trailing twelve-month (TTM) basis, EPS and sales are up 26.4% and 9.2%.

The dividend yield is a solid 2.2% and TXN has outperformed the S&P 500 by 122.9% in the past five years. Clearly, this company rewards the patient investor.
Samsung Electronics (SSNLF)

It may seem strange that Samsung is on a list of Apple supplier stocks. However, the South Korean tech giant uses its Apple supplier status to push down its own electronics manufacturing costs through bulk production.
It is responsible for supplying several components to its competitor, including flash memory used for storing data content, organic light-emitting diode (OLED) panels and the mobile DRAM used for multi-tasking various applications in devices.
Samsung is the least risky option you can take if you want to gain exposure to Apple supplier stocks. There aren’t many devices around the globe that don’t have at least one component designed or built by Samsung.
