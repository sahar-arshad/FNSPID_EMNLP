2021-09-11 00:00:00+00:00,"3 Reasons to Buy Intel, and 1 Reason To Sell",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-reasons-to-buy-intel-and-1-reason-to-sell-2021-09-11,,,"Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) has been a lackluster investment over the past three years. The chipmaker's stock has risen about 15%, but has trailed far behind the PHLX Semiconductor Index's gain of approximately 130%.
Intel generated tepid growth because it suffered chip shortages, postponed chip upgrades, and fell behind TSMC (NYSE: TSM) in the process race to create smaller and more advanced chips. Intel's shares of the PC and data center CPU markets also crumbled as AMD (NASDAQ: AMD), which outsourced its manufacturing to TSMC's superior foundries, gained ground.
Intel also lost Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) as a major customer after Apple bought out its baseband modem business and opted to replace Intel's Mac CPUs with its own Arm-based processors.

CEO Brian Krzanich's abrupt resignation in 2018 unnerved investors, and his successor Bob Swan mainly focused on cutting costs and buying back shares instead of solving Intel's pressing R&D and manufacturing issues. All those challenges caused investors to pivot toward more promising chip stocks.
But could Intel's lackluster performance actually make it a contrarian play in this frothy market? Let's examine three reasons to buy Intel -- as well as one reason to sell it -- to decide.
1. Intel's new CEO has ""accelerated"" plans for the future
Intel ousted Bob Swan earlier this year and replaced him with VMware's former CEO Pat Gelsinger, a chipmaking veteran who previously served as Intel's chief technology officer.
Instead of entertaining the idea of turning Intel into a fabless chipmaker, as Swan did, Gelsinger doubled down on Intel's first-party foundries with a new ""Intel Accelerated"" roadmap in late July.
In this revised roadmap, Intel renamed its nodes to better reflect the transistor density of each generation and highlight more favorable comparisons with TSMC. Gelsinger declared Intel would catch up to TSMC in the process race by 2024, then reclaim the process lead by 2025.
Gelsinger plans to achieve that goal by spending tens of billions of dollars on new foundries, upgrading the company's plants to use ASML's (NASDAQ: ASML) latest lithography machines, expanding its third-party foundry services to pull orders away from TSMC, and attracting government subsidies in the U.S. and Europe to resolve the ongoing chip shortage and eliminate the industry's production bottlenecks in Asia.
If Intel achieves all those goals, its growth could accelerate over the next decade and make it a compelling long-term investment again.
2. Creeping up on AMD and Nvidia with GPUs
Intel generates most of its revenue from PC and data center CPUs, but it launched its first new discrete GPUs in over a decade last year. Intel previously abandoned the high-end GPU market amid tough competition from Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and AMD, but it's now trying to bundle its new GPUs with its CPUs.
Intel could challenge Nvidia and AMD in the laptop market with its DG1 mobile GPUs, pursue the desktop market with its DG2 GPUs, and enter the data center GPU market with its top-tier Ponte Vecchio GPUs.
This is still a fledgling business for Intel, which will ironically rely on TSMC to manufacture its GPUs, but it could generate a new revenue stream while widening its moat against Nvidia and AMD.
3. Intel's stock is cheap
Intel trades at just 12 times forward earnings, while AMD and TSMC trade at 35 times and 25 times forward earnings, respectively. Nvidia has an even higher forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 48.
The bears will claim Intel deserves its discount valuation because it's growing at a much slower rate than those chipmakers. That point its valid -- analysts expect Intel's revenue and earnings to decline in both 2021 and 2022 as it executes its costly turnaround plan.
However, Intel's low multiple and forward yield of 2.6% should also limit its downside potential, and could make it an attractive defensive dividend stock during a market crash.
The one reason to sell Intel: TSMC
Intel could turn around its business over the next few years, but catching up to TSMC could be brutally difficult. TSMC plans to spend up to $100 billion over the next three years to expand its capacity, and it's already secured government subsidies in the U.S. for its new plants in Arizona -- a move which Gelsinger fiercely criticized in a sponsored Politico article in June.
TSMC remains comfortably ahead of Intel in the process race, and its top customers -- which include Apple, AMD, Nvidia, and Qualcomm -- probably won't switch over to Intel's expanding (but untested) third-party foundry services anytime soon.
Gelsinger has set ambitious targets for Intel, but it's trying to turn around a massive business with serious execution issues while competing against an industry leader that is firing on all cylinders.
The risks still outweigh the potential rewards
Intel's stock won't fall off a cliff, but I doubt it will outperform most of its semiconductor peers or the broader market. It could be too late to upgrade its foundries and catch up to TSMC, and it could continue to cede the PC and data center CPU markets to AMD.
Therefore, investors should stick with higher-growth chipmakers like AMD and Nvidia or industry linchpins like TSMC and ASML, but avoid Intel until it backs up Gelsinger's bold claims with some actual progress.

2021-09-10 00:00:00+00:00,EXCLUSIVE-Wide-ranging SolarWinds probe sparks fear in Corporate America,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/exclusive-wide-ranging-solarwinds-probe-sparks-fear-in-corporate-america-2021-09-10-1,,,"By Christopher Bing, Chris Prentice and Joseph Menn
Sept 10 (Reuters) - A U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission investigation into the SolarWinds Russian hacking operation has dozens of corporate executives fearful information unearthed in the expanding probe will expose them to liability, according to six people familiar with the inquiry.
The SEC is asking companies to turn over records into ""any other"" data breach or ransomware attack since October 2019 if they downloaded a bugged network-management software update from SolarWinds Corp SWI.N, which delivers products used across corporate America, according to details of the letters shared with Reuters.
People familiar with the inquiry say the requests may reveal numerous unreported cyber incidents unrelated to the Russian espionage campaign, giving the SEC a rare level of insight into previously unknown incidents that the companies likely never intended to disclose.
""I've never seen anything like this,"" said a consultant who works with dozens of publicly traded companies that recently received the request. ""What companies are concerned about is they don't know how the SEC will use this information. And most companies have had unreported breaches since then."" The consultant spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss his experience.
The requests are voluntary, and companies are obliged to disclose anything material to investors. But the fact the inquiries comes from the SEC's enforcement staff could raise the prospect of investigations and steep penalties if companies fail to disclose breaches or did not have the appropriate controls in place to deal with past attacks, four attorneys who regularly handle SEC cases said.
An SEC official said the request's intent was to find other breaches relevant to the SolarWinds incident.
The SEC told companies they would not be penalized if they shared data about the SolarWinds hack voluntarily, but did not offer that amnesty for other compromises or breaches.
Cyberattacks have grown in both frequency and impact, prompting deep concern in the White House over the last year. U.S. officials have faulted companies for failing to disclose such events, arguing that it conceals the extent of the problem from shareholders, policymakers and law enforcement looking for the worst offenders.
People familiar with the SEC investigation told Reuters the letters went to hundreds of companies, including many in the technology, finance and energy sectors, thought to be potentially affected by the SolarWinds attacks. That number exceeds the 100 that the Department of Homeland Security said had downloaded the bad SolarWinds software and then had it exploited.
Since last year, only about two dozen firms have been publicly identified as impacted, including Microsoft Corp MSFT.O, Cisco Systems CSCO.O, FireEye Inc FEYE.O and Intel Corp INTC.O. Of those contacted for this story only Cisco confirmed receiving the SEC letter. A Cisco spokesperson said it has responded to the SEC's request.
Cybersecurity research has also suggested software maker Qualys Inc QLYS.O and oil energy company Chevron Corp CVX.N were among those targeted in the Russian cyber operation. Both declined to comment on the SEC investigation.
About 18,000 clients of SolarWinds downloaded a hacked version of its software, which the cyber criminals manipulated for potential future access. Yet only a small subset of those customers saw follow-on hacking activity, suggesting the attackers infected far more companies than they ultimately victimized.
The SEC sent letters last month to companies believed to have been affected, following an initial round sent in June, according to six sources who have seen the letters.
The second wave of requests were addressed to recipients at companies from the first round who had not responded. The exact number of recipients is unclear.
The current probe is ""unprecedented,"" said Jina Choi, a partner at Morrison & Foerster LLP and former SEC director who has worked on cybersecurity cases.
""I can’t recall a sweep of this breadth that was not publicly announced, so that folks could really understand what the goal was of the SEC’s investigation,"" she said.
Though the SEC issued guidance a decade ago calling for companies to disclose hacks that could be material, then updated that guidance in 2018, many disclosures have been vague or boilerplate, attorneys said.
Former SEC official Jay Dubow said the SEC's approach could be less about the SEC being aggressive and more about trying to understand the impacts of the SolarWinds incident.
""The SEC was faced with a situation where you have SolarWinds and so many of their clients were public companies and other government agencies. What is the most efficient way for the SEC to try to figure out the extent of all this?"" Dubow, an attorney at Troutman Pepper, said.
Regulators have at times been hesitant to penalize companies for such issues, given they are victims of these attacks.
Gary Gensler, who took the helm at the SEC in April, has tasked the agency with issuing new disclosure requirements ranging from cybersecurity to climate risk.
While the hack was first reported by Reuters more than nine months ago, the actual impact of the wide-scale digital spying operation, which U.S. officials say came from a Russian intelligence service, remains largely unknown.
Government officials have shied away from sharing a comprehensive account of what was stolen or what the Russians were after, but described it as traditional government espionage.
In scores of SEC filings reviewed by Reuters, most companies referring to the SolarWinds hacks cite the events only as an example of the sort of intrusion they might one day experience. Of those that do say they had SolarWinds software installed, most say they do not believe their most sensitive data was taken.
But some companies that say the hackers did get into their systems, such as Sana Biotech, admitted they cannot be sure there was a larger issue.
“Although investigations remain ongoing regarding the extent to which our confidential information was accessed, lost or stolen as a result of this cyberattack on SolarWinds, any such access, loss or theft could have a materially adverse effect on our business,"" Sana Biotech SANA.Odeclared in its annual 10k filing.
John Reed Stark, former head of the SEC’s office of internet enforcement, said “companies will struggle to answer these questions – not just because these are broad, sweeping and all-encompassing requests, but also because the SEC is bound to discover some sort of mistake"" in what they've previously disclosed.

2021-09-10 00:00:00+00:00,"Intel Is Starting to Look Like a Value — Next Stop, $67",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intel-is-starting-to-look-like-a-value-next-stop-%2467-2021-09-10,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) has had a rough year. So far in 2021, INTC stock is up just 7.5% from $49.82 at the end of December 2020 to $53.57 as of the close on Sept. 8. In fact, since April 9, when it hit $68.26, the stock tumbled down to $52.01 on Aug. 20. Since then it has slowly drifted up to over $53.

However, now I think there is good reason to believe that INTC stock could move substantially higher. This is based on the company’s recent performance and the outlook that it gave for the rest of the year.
Free Cash Flow Estimates Intel
The company reported respectable quarterly numbers on July 22 for its fiscal second quarter. The key item, from my standpoint, is its huge free cash flow (FCF) production. As a result, I now estimate that INTC stock could be worth at least $67.50 or 26.5% over Wednesday’s close.
The reason is actually quite simple. The company itself projects that it will produce $11 billion in FCF during 2021. This can be seen on page 17 of its earnings release where it projects revenue and FCF for the full year. Since Intel also projects $73.5 billion in non-GAAP revenue, the FCF margin will be 15% of its forecast revenue (i.e., $11 billion/$$73.5 billion).

7 of the Best Large-Cap Stocks to Buy Now
However, after looking at this more closely I realized that the company is spending a lot more on capex this year than normal. For example, in the trailing 12 months (TTM) to June 30, the company spent $16.03 billion on capex, not $19 billion as in its projections on page 17. So, on a normalized basis, Intel’s FCF margin is closer to 19% (i.e., $14 billion/$73.5 billion).
This is important, since I want to use a comparison with Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) to figure out Intel’s valuation.
Comparison With AMD
AMD reported excellent Q2 numbers as well. Its free cash flow worked out to $888 million on $3.85 billion in sales for the quarter. That works out to an FCF margin of $23%, or 4 percentage points above our projection for Intel this year on a normalized basis. This means it is 21% more profitable than Intel.
Since analysts expect the company to make $15.63 billion in revenue this year according to analyst estimate surveyed by Seeking Alpha, its FCF could reach $3.6 billion (i.e., 23% x $15.63 billion). This is important since it represents 2.8% of its $128.78 billion in market value. In other words, its FCF yield is 2.8%.
Therefore we can use this to value INTC stock.
Now, at present with its $11 billion in FCF, Intel has a 5% FCF yield. This is seen by dividing its $11 billion FCF estimate for this year by its market value today of $217.333 billion.
However, since Intel’s FCF margin is only 21% below AMD’s, maybe we should value INTC stock with an FCF yield that is just 21% worse than AMD’s 2.8% FCF yield. In other words, a 3.39% FCF is 21% worse than the 2.8% yield, but to be safe, simplistic, and conservative, let’s use 4%. (Remember if you divide a number with a higher divisor, the quotient or result will be a lower number).
So, in this case, dividing the Intel FCF estimate of $11 billion by 4% results in a target market value of $275 billion. That represents a potential gain of 26.5% over its present $217.3 billion market cap. Note we did not use the normalized $14 billion FCF estimate
In other words, our target price for INTC stock is $67.50, or 26.5% higher than its price today of $53.57. It would be much higher with the $14 billion FCF normalized estimate.
What To Do With INTC Stock
If we believe Intel, the company will produce $11 billion in FCF. Using a very conservative FCF yield measure of 4%, the stock is worth $67.50. This method involves a more conservative FCF yield than what it should be vs. AMD stock.
As a result, value investors might want to begin taking a toehold stake in INTC stock.
And one more thing. It doesn’t hurt to wait for the stock to rise. The company pays a dividend with an annual dividend yield of 2.6%.

2021-09-10 00:00:00+00:00,Why NVIDIA Will Dominate the Data Center by 2030,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-nvidia-will-dominate-the-data-center-by-2030-2021-09-10,,,"Over the last decade, NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) hardware has become synonymous with cutting-edge graphics and high performance computing. Not surprisingly, shareholders have done quite well for themselves. The stock is up a whopping 1,300% in the last five years alone, crushing the performance of the broader market.
However, this chipmaker still has plenty of room to grow its business, especially in the data center space. Here's what investors should know.
The leader in accelerated computing
In 1999, NVIDIA invented the graphics processing unit (GPU), a chip capable of parallelizing computing-intensive code. In other words, GPUs can handle lots of data very quickly. While these chips were originally created to render ultra-realistic video game graphics, they have since become an important part of data centers.
Image source: NVIDIA.
Specifically, NVIDIA GPUs have become the gold standard for accelerating workloads like analytics, artificial intelligence, and scientific computing. In fact, the company recently set records at the MLPerf benchmarks, a series of tests designed to measure the performance of AI compute platforms. And NVIDIA currently controls 90% of the market for supercomputer accelerators.
Data center budgets were still heavily skewed toward central processing units (CPUs) in 2020, with these chips comprising 83% of total spend on processors. But Ark Invest believes that figure will drop to 40% over the next decade. In other words, by 2030, GPUs will not only be the dominant data center accelerator, they will also be the dominant processor.
That's good news for NVIDIA. Management puts its addressable market in the data center business at $100 billion by 2024, but that figure should be even bigger by 2030. And given the company's strong competitive position, NVIDIA is well positioned to capture the lion's share of that sum.

A three-chip company
NVIDIA has also expanded beyond its trademark GPU. In 2020, it completed its $7 billion acquisition of Mellanox, a company that specializes in high-performance networking solutions. Since the merger, NVIDIA has introduced a new chip that incorporates Mellanox technology: the data processing unit (DPU).
This chip offloads networking, storage, and security tasks from CPUs, boosting performance and efficiency. More broadly, the Mellanox acquisition makes NVIDIA's compute platform more robust, enabling the company to optimize workloads across computing, networking, and storage, which should drive market share gains in the data center.
More recently, NVIDIA announced a third chip: the Grace CPU. This processor is slated to launch in 2023, and features energy-efficient ARM cores that pack ten times the performance of today's fastest servers. The Grace CPU will join the GPU and DPU to complete NVIDIA's compute platform, and there's reason to believe it will be a success.
For the last two decades, CPUs built on x86 architecture -- think Intel and AMD -- have dominated the data center, and the pair captured 92% market share in 2020. But Ark Invest believes that will change over the next 10 years, because ARM CPUs are becoming faster and cheaper. To that end, Ark estimates that ARM and RISC-V will hold 71% market share by 2030, while x86 chips will drop to 27%.
Again, this is good news for NVIDIA. If this trend does indeed play out, investors should expect the Grace CPU -- which is built on ARM cores -- to be a key growth driver.
The bottom line
NVIDIA is now a three-chip company, meaning its product portfolio now addresses a greater portion of data center infrastructure. And in the years ahead, NVIDIA should see strong demand as GPUs become the most prevalent data center processor, and ARM chips become the most prevalent data center CPU.
That's why I think NVIDIA will dominate the data center by 2030.

Owners of Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock should know you don’t have a profit until you sell the asset and have cash in your pocket.
Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com
I’m one of those shareholders. I got in two years ago, at $151. I now have four times more shares than I did then. Thanks to this year’s stock split, each is worth $221.
Nvidia has a market cap of around $569 billion on expected sales of $21 billion. That’s also 82 times its expected earnings.
Second quarter earnings beat estimates, with net income of $1.04/share and revenue of $6.5 billion. Nokia has guided to $6.8 billion of revenue in the current quarter.
Is it time to take something off the table?
Why NVDA Stock Is So High
Nvidia, as I have said many times, is a software company masquerading as a hardware company.
Nvidia designs graphics processors. These have huge markets in gaming consoles, Bitcoin rigs, data centers and artificial intelligence. Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM) is its foundry.
This means Nvidia can harvest software margins on hardware. It doesn’t bear the enormous cost of production, as TSMC and rival Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) do.

7 of the Best Large-Cap Stocks to Buy Now
About one-third of every dollar coming into Nvidia becomes net income. With revenue expected to be up 37% this year, after a 45% increase the year before, you can see why NVDA stock is pricey.
As its range of application shows, rapid calculation is the hottest thing in computing right now. Graphics processors were developed to offload compute-intensive tasks from general processing units (GPUs), like the Intel x86 series. GPUs and CPUs work together.
That’s why the announcement that Nvidia would buy CPU designer ARM Holdings from Softbank (OTCMKTS:SFTBY) for $40 billion last year supercharged NVDA stock. A
RM licenses a basic CPU design to other designers and is at the heart of the Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) A1 chip, among many others. The ARM deal had some wags predicting Nvidia might someday surpass Apple in valuation.
Is NvidiaToo Big?
Nvidia has yet to gain clearance for the ARM deal. Opposition is mounting, especially in Europe.
UK regulators have already given a preliminary thumbs-down. The fear is that Nvidia would use ARM to boost its own designs, rather than share innovations equally with all its customers.
This has some wags suggesting Nvidia should walk away from ARM and buy VMWare (NYSE:VMW) instead. The virtualization software company is worth about $60 billion.
Buying VMWare would improve Nvidia’s data center story. There it already owns Mellanox, whose “storage fabric” and software improves data center performance.
Beyond all this lies the “metaverse.” This is a combination of artificial intelligence, virtual reality, and augmented reality that can bring users inside a computer application, creating a virtual world.
Nvidia is bringing both software and video tools to the party, which combines technologies worth trillions of dollars into a larger whole. 
The Bottom Line
This year has been enormous for Nvidia. NVDA stock is up 75% just since January.
That’s why, even though I’m a long-term bull, I’ve been recommending investors lighten up.
After I last suggested traders take profits, however, other investors piled in. By mid-August, Nvidia had taken out its previous high. That’s why I have failed to pull the trigger on my own recommendation.
My concern now, however, is for the whole market. Investors own lots of garbage. New markets will come into being after the infrastructure bill passes.
Uncertainty will send the market down and you will want cash to seize the opportunities. Nvidia may be a good place to find it.

The ""ultra-affordable"" smartphone, developed jointly by Reliance's telecom arm and Google, was set to be rolled out from Sept. 10.
Companies globally are tackling a massive semiconductor shortage as the COVID-19 pandemic-led shift to remote working drove demand for the critical component used in making laptops and phones. As a fallout, several automakers have also suspended production.
""Both the companies have begun testing JioPhone Next with a limited set of users for further refinement and are actively working to make it available more widely in time for the Diwali festive season,"" Jio said in an exchange filing late on Thursday.
The annual festive season in India typically lasts for 30 days, beginning in October and ending with Diwali — set for Nov. 4 this year. Indians usually make big-ticket purchases from jewellery to gadgets and cars around this period.
The additional time will also help mitigate the current industry-wide global semiconductor shortages, Jio added.
In June, when the phone was announced, Reliance Chairman Mukesh Ambani did not specify its price but said it will be the most affordable smartphone ""not just in India, but globally"".
Jio disrupted India's telecom market in 2016 when it launched with cut-price data plans and free voice services, forcing several competitors out of the market. It is now India's biggest mobile carrier with more than 425 million customers.
Ambani had also said in June that Jio, which counts Facebook FB.O, Qualcomm QCOM.O and Intel INTC.O among its backers, was confident of being the first to launch 5G services in India.

2021-09-09 00:00:00+00:00,INTC October 29th Options Begin Trading,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intc-october-29th-options-begin-trading-2021-09-09,,,"Investors in Intel Corp (Symbol: INTC) saw new options become available today, for the October 29th expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the INTC options chain for the new October 29th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $51.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.17. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $51.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $49.83 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of INTC, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $53.64/share today.
Because the $51.00 strike represents an approximate 5% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 100%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 2.29% return on the cash commitment, or 16.75% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Intel Corp, and highlighting in green where the $51.00 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $54.00 strike price has a current bid of $2.04. If an investor was to purchase shares of INTC stock at the current price level of $53.64/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $54.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 4.47% if the stock gets called away at the October 29th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if INTC shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Intel Corp, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing INTC's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $54.00 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $54.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 3.80% boost of extra return to the investor, or 27.76% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.
Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $53.64) to be 33%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

Two top growth stocks that are poised to deliver market-beating returns over the next decade or more are Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL). Here are the key factors that should fuel their prospects for a long time.

Apple
Apple has all the qualities that long-term investors should look for in a stock. It has a loyal base of customers making use of 1.65 billion active Apple devices. It generates loads of cash -- $95 billion in free cash flow over the last four quarters alone. Above all, it has tremendous brand power combined with a very sticky ecosystem of services.
Smartphone rival Samsung just launched its latest round of foldable phones -- the Galaxy Z Fold 3 and Galaxy Z Flip 3 -- and they've received good reviews. Apple still hasn't unveiled a competing offering, but it's always late to the party when it comes to adopting the latest technologies. Yet its customer satisfaction rates remain high, driving a record $347 billion in total spending on products and services over the last year.
What keeps Apple users from jumping ship to competitors' products is the software experience. Its ever-growing suite of services, accessories, and features forms a wide competitive moat. Services revenue increased 28% year over year through the first three quarters of fiscal 2021. Sales of wearables and accessories, including the Apple Watch, grew 30%. The array of apps and features like Handoff, which allows a user to switch seamlessly from an app on an iOS device to a Mac, makes Apple's devices work better together, which gives customers an extra incentive to just stick with the company for all of their tech needs.
It's no surprise that Apple continues to report strong growth for non-iPhone products. Mac sales surged 16% year over year in the most recent quarter. Moreover, the new M1-based Macs, featuring Apple's new internally developed processor, position the company to squeeze extra profit out of its computer business since the M1 chip is estimated to cost Apple less than the Intel chips it previously used.
As for iPhones, consumers are getting more interested in upgrading to 5G devices, which is expected to make the launch of the iPhone 13 a big one. The prospect of a strong upgrade cycle to 5G devices, combined with the continued growth of its higher-margin services business, makes Apple a solid investment.

PayPal
PayPal has delivered many years of consistent growth, previously as part of eBay and now as an independent company, but the pandemic has accelerated the trend away from cash and toward digital payments. A Mastercard survey found that 71% of consumers expect to use cash for transactions less often in the future, which plays right into the hands of PayPal.
The digital payments provider's customer engagement has steadily climbed in recent years and should continue to do so. Since the end of 2017, transactions per account have climbed from 33.6 on a trailing-12-month basis to 43.5 as of the second quarter of 2021. This means the average customer still uses their PayPal account less than once per week, but there are good reasons to expect this metric to continue rising.
Recent introductions of a cryptocurrency trading feature and a buy-now, pay-later option, plus the potential for adding the ability to trade stocks from within the app, could significantly grow engagement across PayPal's 403 million active accounts.
This growing array of services and features has a direct correlation with PayPal's rising revenue. For example, it has seen a 19% increase in total payment volume from customers who use its QR codes to check out at stores.
The company has experienced phenomenal growth, and the stock delivered a massive return of 640% over the last five years. Its revenue also more than doubled, and that is with customers still using their accounts less than once per week on average. PayPal could grow enormously from here if engagement strengthens, which is management's goal. For these reasons, this growth stock should remain a rewarding investment for years to come.

2021-09-09 00:00:00+00:00,Is This Going to Be Intel's Big Break?,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/is-this-going-to-be-intels-big-break-2021-09-09,,,"Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) has been hit hard by rival Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) in the x86 CPU (central processing unit) market, losing share in servers and PC processors thanks to the latter's technological advantage.
But Chipzilla is now taking aim at AMD as well as Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), with a move into the multibillion-dollar discrete graphics processing unit (GPU) market.
Image source: Getty Images.
Intel has set its sights on a massive opportunity
Intel recently revealed that the first generation of its Arc discrete graphics cards will arrive in the first quarter of 2022. Chipzilla says that its cards will ""deliver high-performance gaming, immersive visuals, and seamless game streaming and creation experiences.""
Codenamed Alchemist, the first-generation discrete graphics cards from Intel will include ray-tracing technology and artificial intelligence-based supersampling. Rivals AMD and Nvidia already pack such technology into their cards, and gamers have been eagerly buying their latest generation GPUs to elevate the gaming experience. What's more, Intel's roadmap indicates that it has three more generations of its Arc graphics cards -- Battlemage, Celestial, and Druid -- lined up after Alchemist, which means that it plans to consistently improve its GPUs with time.
All of this is an indication that Intel is serious about making a dent in the discrete GPU market, which may herald a much-needed turnaround in the company's fortunes and help arrest the recent slide in its financial performance. More importantly, there are a few reasons Chipzilla could take market share away from the likes of AMD and Nvidia once it launches its cards.
First, the Alchemist GPUs will be based on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing's 6-nanometer (nm) N6 process node. AMD's current RDNA 2 gaming GPUs are based on a 7 nm process, while Nvidia's Ampere gaming GPUs are based on Samsung's 8 nm process. AMD is expected to make the jump to TSMC's 6 nm process when it launches its next-generation RDNA 3 graphics cards. Meanwhile, rumors suggest that Nvidia could make the jump to a 5 nm manufacturing process when it launches its next-generation cards -- codenamed Ada Lovelace -- in 2022.
The identical manufacturing processes mean that Intel could be on equal footing with Nvidia and AMD on the technology front. So, Chipzilla is coming into the GPU market with solid preparations that could make it a viable third choice for gamers, who have been struggling to buy graphics cards because Nvidia and AMD can't make enough of them.
This brings us to the second reason Intel may be able to cut its teeth in the discrete GPU market: Nvidia and AMD are unable to produce enough cards to meet the huge end-market demand.
Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang explained on the August earnings conference call:
RTX demand is quite incredible. ... And now, we reset the entire installed base and Ampere is off to just an incredible starting the best-selling GPU architecture in the history of our company. And yet, we've only upgraded some 20% -- less than 20% of our total installed base.
Similarly, AMD is also witnessing a robust demand environment, which is why CEO Lisa Su recently pointed out that supply would continue to remain tight despite the company's efforts to increase capacity.
Intel can fill the void to some extent by bringing a viable GPU alternative to Nvidia and AMD. It might be able to lure potential AMD and Nvidia customers into its fold and get off to a good start in the discrete graphics card market if it can produce enough units. As such, don't be surprised to see Intel doing well in the GPU market next year, which would bode well for the chipmaker thanks to the massive end-market opportunity on offer.
Long-term gains could be in the cards
It's evident that Intel is in the discrete graphics card game for the long haul, as the company has laid bare its roadmap that currently includes four generations of GPUs. Success in this market could add billions of dollars to Intel's revenue; discrete graphics cards are expected to generate $54 billion in revenue by 2025, up substantially from $23.6 billion in 2020, according to Jon Peddie Research.
Nvidia is currently the dominant player in this space with a market share of 83% in the second quarter, and AMD holding the rest. As it turns out, AMD is finding it difficult to withstand the competitive pressure from Nvidia, and this could be an opportunity for Intel to make a dent. If Intel starts taking away GPU market share from AMD and lures away potential Nvidia customers by producing enough cards and offering a steady flow of supply, it can gradually establish itself as a key player in the GPU market in the long run.
That could give Intel a much-needed boost, as the company's top line is on track to drop this year to $73.5 billion over 2020's revenue of $77.9 billion. The downtrend may continue in 2022 as per analysts' estimates, but steady progress in the GPU market could give Intel a much-needed break and help this tech stock regain its mojo.

2021-09-09 00:00:00+00:00,The Math Shows SOXX Can Go To $526,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/the-math-shows-soxx-can-go-to-%24526-2021-09-09,,,"Looking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at ETF Channel, we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. For the iShares Semiconductor ETF (Symbol: SOXX), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $526.21 per unit.
With SOXX trading at a recent price near $463.14 per unit, that means that analysts see 13.62% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of SOXX's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are LG Display Co Ltd (Symbol: LPL), Skyworks Solutions Inc (Symbol: SWKS), and Intel Corp (Symbol: INTC). Although LPL has traded at a recent price of $8.70/share, the average analyst target is 72.41% higher at $15.00/share. Similarly, SWKS has 20.14% upside from the recent share price of $177.71 if the average analyst target price of $213.50/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting INTC to reach a target price of $62.00/share, which is 15.74% above the recent price of $53.57. Below is a twelve month price history chart comparing the stock performance of LPL, SWKS, and INTC:
Combined, LPL, SWKS, and INTC represent 9.91% of the iShares Semiconductor ETF. Below is a summary table of the current analyst target prices discussed above:
NAME SYMBOL RECENT PRICE AVG. ANALYST 12-MO. TARGET % UPSIDE TO TARGET
iShares Semiconductor ETF SOXX $463.14 $526.21 13.62%
LG Display Co Ltd LPL $8.70 $15.00 72.41%
Skyworks Solutions Inc SWKS $177.71 $213.50 20.14%
Intel Corp INTC $53.57 $62.00 15.74%
Are analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past. These are questions that require further investor research.

NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - The chip industry usually invests too much or too little. Persistent global semiconductor shortages, especially in automaking, indicate capital discipline went too far in recent years, but the pendulum has started to swing back. In the latest sign of that shift, Intel Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger said on Tuesday that the U.S. company planned to invest up to $95 billion in Europe over the next decade. While capital expenditure has increased, especially at the biggest firms like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing and Samsung Electronics, it’s still short of the sort of splurges that have triggered past gluts.
There are good reasons for these booms and busts. Semiconductor demand has risen for decades and should keep growing. Gelsinger on Tuesday predicted that chips would make up a fifth of the cost of an auto in 2030, compared with 4% in 2019, as cars become electric and autonomous. Building a plant is a giant gamble. TSMC, for example, spent more than $15 billion on its latest cutting-edge one in Taiwan. Companies are therefore reluctant to embark on such projects unless they are sure plants can run near full capacity to earn a decent return. Such behavior leaves limited wiggle room for demand overshoots. Chips are cheap and indispensable, as idling auto plants worldwide currently illustrate. Customers will often order extra chips when supplies are tight, to ensure they have enough.
The problem is that while each company is listening to the market, the sector herds together. Intel, Samsung Electronics and TSMC plan to invest around $75 billion combined in semiconductors this year, up from about $50 billion in 2019. Even so, Semico Research estimated the industry as a whole would spend only 13% more than 2020. Estimates are rising though, as Gartner estimated in July the increase would be 28%. Both estimates are still modest compared with the 85% jump seen in 2000 or the surge of 107% in 2010, according to researcher IC Insights. Each time, there was a rare decline in chip shipments within two years.
Given persistent semiconductor production shortages, and the growing desire of nations from China to the United States to subsidize chip production, investment may well pick up next year. That would be a stronger sign that the inevitable hangover awaits further out.

CONTEXT NEWS
- Intel Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger said on Sept. 7 that the company would announce the locations of two major new European chip plants by the end of 2021. Intel said it could invest as much as 80 billion euros in the continent over the next 10 years and that it would reserve capacity in its plant in Ireland to produce chips for automakers.
Speaking at Munich's IAA auto show, Gelsinger said the company believed chips would make up 20% of the cost of vehicles by 2030, compared with about 4% in 2019. The global auto manufacturing sector has been hit by production shortfalls over the past year due to shortages of semiconductors needed to make vehicles.
The semiconductor industry is expected to spend $127 billion on capital expenditure in 2021, Semico Research estimated in March. That would be an increase of 13% from 2020.

More details on Validea's John Neff strategy
About John Neff: While known as the manager with whom many top managers entrusted their own money, Neff was far from the smooth-talking, high-profile Wall Streeter you might expect. He was mild-mannered and low-key, and the same might be said of the Windsor Fund that he managed for more than three decades. In fact, Neff himself described the fund as ""relatively prosaic, dull, [and] conservative."" There was nothing dull about his results, however. From 1964 to 1995, Neff guided Windsor to a 13.7 percent average annual return, easily outpacing the S&P 500's 10.6 percent return during that time. That 3.1 percentage point difference is huge over time -- a $10,000 investment in Windsor (with dividends reinvested) at the start of Neff's tenure would have ended up as more than $564,000 by the time he retired, more than twice what the same investment in the S&P would have yielded (about $233,000). Considering the length of his tenure, that track record may be the best ever for a manager of such a large fund.

2021-09-08 00:00:00+00:00,Qualcomm CEO open to working with foundry partners in Europe,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/qualcomm-ceo-open-to-working-with-foundry-partners-in-europe-2021-09-08,,,"By Christoph Steitz
MUNICH, Sept 8 (Reuters) - Semiconductor supplier Qualcomm QCOM.O is open to working with foundries in Europe if incentive programmes to boost automotive chip production on the continent attract the right partners, Chief Executive Cristiano Amon said.
Foundries in Europe are now geared towards mass production of semiconductors, Amon told Reuters at the IAA car show in Munich, but there is a welcome debate under way about investing in high-end production that is interesting to Qualcomm.
""There is a very constructive dialogue taking place, by the French government, the European government, I think they have an interest in attracting foundries to Europe,"" Amon said in an interview.
To tackle a chip shortage that has hit Europe's carmakers and exposed its dependence on Asia, the EU is pushing for multibillion-dollar investments to double the continent's share of global chip production over the next decade.
Also at the Munich car show, U.S. chipmaker Intel INTC.O flagged investments of up to 80 billion euros ($95 billion) over the next decade in two major European chip plants, with details to be announced by the end of this year.
Intel will also open up its semiconductor plant in Ireland for automakers, CEO Pat Gelsinger said in a keynote speech.
LEADING EDGE
Most of Qualcomm's manufacturing is aimed at leading-edge technology, with the majority of foundries in that area located in Taiwan, South Korea and the United States, Amon said, adding it was in full support of the EU plans to attract foundries.
""In the event that that happens with the leading process technology, Qualcomm is definitely going to be interested in utilising those foundries.""
The California-based group, the world's No.1 supplier of key semiconductors in mobile phones, has been pushing into the car sector with chips that can power dashboards and infotainment systems at the same time.
Qualcomm's commitment to the car sector is also reflected by a recent $4.6 billion bid for Swedish auto parts maker Veoneer Inc VNE.N, which Amon said had been well received by the industry.
""We're in the automotive industry to stay,"" he said.
Amon, who took the helm at Qualcomm in June, said he was meeting the CEOs of all major German carmakers this week, adding Qualcomm was now working with 23 of the 26 global automotive brands.
""Today we have existing commercial relationship and future planned relationships with all the German carmakers,"" Amon said, adding it had built up a $10 billion contracted backlog in its automotive business over the past four years.
This week, Qualcomm announced a deal with France's Renault RENA.PA, which followed an agreement with General Motors GM.N earlier this year.
Qualcomm works with all major global foundries, or contract manufacturers, including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing 2330.TW, Samsung Electronics 005930.KS, GlobalFoundries and Semiconductor Manufacturing International 0981.HK.
Amon said the company had done a lot in the past 12 months to build new manufacturing facilities with its suppliers to counter the global chip shortage: ""We expect to enter 2022 with the majority of this problem behind us.""

SAN FRANCISCO/MUNICH, Sept 7 (Reuters) - The chief executive of Intel Corp's INTC.O self-driving vehicle technology unit Mobileye said it plans an initial deployment of 50 autonomous taxis in Munich, Germany next year, and added that rival Tesla Inc's TSLA.O driver assistant system is not ""safe enough.""
Mobileye said it hopes to remove safety drivers from the robotaxis by the end of next year and scale up the technology across Germany and other European countries later this decade upon regulatory approval.
Mobileye on Tuesday unveiled vehicles equipped with its self-driving system that will be used for commercial, driverless ride-hailing services that it plans to provide with German mobility service provider SIXT.
The self-driving vehicles produced by Chinese carmaker NIO were certified to go up to 130km an hour (over 80 mph) in Munich, Mobileye’s vice-president of autonomous vehicle standards Jack Weast said in an interview with Reuters.
Weast added that German regulation permitting autonomous driving contributed to the company's choice of Munich as its deployment city.
The German law, passed in May, is the first federal law worldwide to permit autonomous driving in regular traffic, albeit only in set areas and with the requirement that the vehicle be overseen by a human.
Self-driving tech firms like Waymo have yet to successfully deploy autonomous vehicles beyond limited areas, hampered by cost and technical and regulatory challenges.
Mobileye, a former supplier of Tesla, develops a camera-centric self-driving system similar to Tesla's, but plans to add sensors that cost more but enhance safety of self-driving vehicles, CEO Amnon Shashua said.
""Even though we can power a full self driving vehicle with only cameras, we feel that at this point in time, it's not safe enough,"" he said at an embargoed press briefing ahead of the IAA Mobility event in Munich.
He said additional sensors would provide robustness to its self-driving system to prove it is much better than human drivers when it comes to reducing accidents.
U.S. regulators have been probing the safety of what Tesla calls ""Full Self-driving"" capability, which helps drivers stay in lanes and steer on highways, following a series of accidents including a fatal crash in Texas.

2021-09-07 00:00:00+00:00,Intel says it will reserve Ireland chip factory capacity for automakers,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intel-says-it-will-reserve-ireland-chip-factory-capacity-for-automakers-2021-09-07,,,"By Stephen Nellis
Sept 7 (Reuters) - Intel Corp INTC.O on Tuesday said that it will reserve factory capacity at its semiconductor plant in Ireland for automakers and has created a program to help them transition to making chips in its factories.
Intel, the biggest maker of processor chips for PCs and data centers, in March said it planned to open up its chip factories for outsiders to use.
Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger told Reuters in April that the company wanted to start producing chips for automakers within six to nine months to help alleviate a shortage that has disrupted vehicle production around the world.
It is unclear whether the latest announcement means Intel will meet that goal.
Gelsinger was due to outline details of the new program on Tuesday at the IAA automotive show in Germany. The ""Intel Foundry Services Accelerator"" is aimed at helping automakers learn to make chips using what Intel calls its ""Intel 16"" chip manufacturing technology and later move to its ""Intel 3"" and ""Intel 18A"" technologies.
Those manufacturing processes would be far more advanced than most of the processes used in the automotive industry today. Intel said that several automakers and key suppliers - including BMW AG BMWG.DE, Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE, Daimler AG DAIGn.DE and Bosch - had expressed support for its programs, but an Intel spokesman declined to confirm whether any had committed to becoming customers.
Intel views automakers as a key strategic priority. Gelsinger was expected to say Tuesday that the company believes chips will make up 20% of the cost of vehicles by 2030, a five-fold increase from 4% of the cost in 2019.

2021-09-06 00:00:00+00:00,Intel Stock: Low Valuation Makes it Worth The Wait,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intel-stock%3A-low-valuation-makes-it-worth-the-wait-2021-09-06,,,"There’s no denying that Intel (INTC) stock is cheap.  Shares in the semiconductor giant trade for a low forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 13x. That’s far below the valuation of its main chip rivals, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Nvidia (NVDA), which trade for around 44x and 54.9x earnings, respectively.
Much of this valuation discrepancy has to do with the company’s anemic growth and its many past missteps. But with a new CEO, Pat Gelsinger, who could turn around its ship, Intel might be able to make a comeback. If it does, earnings could improve, and the market may in turn reward it with a much higher forward valuation multiple.
The issue? This will take time. Impatient investors may not be willing to ride things out until the stock, at $53.51 today, starts to move higher once again. (See Intel stock charts on TipRanks)
That said, given its low valuation, possible improvements ahead for its business, and its solid 2.6% dividend yield, I’m bullish. The upside from proving its critics wrong outweighs the risk that it further disappoints investors.
INTC Stock: Still Paying for its Past Mistakes
In recent years, AMD and Nvidia have seen strong market share gains, at Intel’s expense. This has been most severe in terms of CPU market share. Since 2019, Intel has gone from having 76.8% of the CPU market, to just over 60%.
The reason? Manufacturing hiccups, which in turn has resulted in product delays. As mentioned above, its new leadership is working to move on from these past issues, and make up for lost time.
For now, investors will still punish the stock for its past mistakes. Worse yet, as analyst Christopher Danley of Citi put in a research note published last month, the company could face continued challenges in the short-term.
However, investors shouldn’t take this to mean the best move is to avoid INTC stock. Heavily discounted, these issues are more than accounted for at today’s share price. If it manages to improve its results? Investors could respond by pushing the stock to substantially higher prices.
Why it May be All Uphill From Here
Again, the Intel comeback will take more than a quarter or two to play out. That’s the case when it comes to resolving issues with its supply chain, via new outsourcing deals with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM), as well as the $20 billion it’s investing into its U.S. foundry operations.
It’s also the case when it comes to releasing new CPU and GPU chips to compete with AMD and Nvidia. In short, it won’t be until at least 2022 that its turnaround starts to bear fruit. Share performance could remain underwhelming for the months ahead. 
Nevertheless, buying INTC stock now, ahead of the situation continuing to improve, could be a worthwhile move. Why? Again, with shares priced for disappointment, downside risk may be minimal. It could make a trip back to its 52-week low ($43.61). Yet that pales in comparison to the possible upside if its turnaround efforts pay off.
To what extent is the upside potential? If the company’s efforts prove effective, it could be able to hit the top end of analyst estimates for 2022 ($59.18 per share).
In turn, the market could also reward it by giving shares a much higher forward valuation multiple. A move to a forward P/E in the high-teens, from the 13x it’s at today, could enable the stock to make its way to between $90 and $100 per share.
What Analysts are Saying About INTC Stock
According to TipRanks, INTC stock has a consensus rating of Hold. Out of 25 analyst ratings, 9 rate it a Buy, 9 analysts rate it a Hold, and 7 analysts rate it a Sell.
As for price targets, the average Intel price target is $61.29 per share, implying around 14.54% in upside from today’s prices. Analyst price targets range from a low of $40 per share, to a high of $85 per share.
Bottom Line: Intel could be a Buy
Admittedly, it’s still questionable whether a new CEO at the helm will change the story for Intel. Even if it does, it may take time, as the stock continues to flounder.
However, if investors can be patient, it may pay to take advantage of its low valuation, and buy INTC stock. The wait may be worth it. Not only that, there’s a decent dividend to collect along the way.

2021-09-05 00:00:00+00:00,Is Ambarella Stock a Buy?,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/is-ambarella-stock-a-buy-2021-09-05,,,"Share prices of Ambarella (NASDAQ: AMBA) hit an all-time high after the chipmaker posted its second-quarter earnings on Aug. 31. Its revenue rose 58% year over year to $79.3 million, beating estimates by $3.4 million. Its non-GAAP net income rose more than sixfold to $13.1 million, or $0.35 per share, and beat estimates by a dime.
Ambarella might be a lesser-known chipmaker, but its stock has rallied more than 120% over the past 12 months. Let's see why it attracted so many bulls, and whether or not it still has more room to run.
Image source: Getty Images.
A brief history of Ambarella
Ambarella designs image processing SoCs (system on chips) and computer vision chips. Its image-processing SoCs process photos and videos for cameras, drones, and other gadgets, while its computer vision chips help security cameras identify faces, help driverless vehicles avoid obstacles, and enable other devices to process AI-related tasks.
Six years ago, Ambarella's top customer was GoPro (NASDAQ: GPRO). However, GoPro's growth stalled out, and its subsequent decline torpedoed Ambarella's stock.
Ambarella pivoted away from GoPro by focusing on the security camera and automotive markets. However, the Trump administration blacklisted several of Ambarella's top security camera customers in China last year, and it faced escalating competition from Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) -- which had expanded into the computer vision market with its acquisitions of Movidius and Mobileye.
The pandemic also disrupted the automotive market last year, and Ambarella remains heavily exposed to chip shortages since it's a fabless chipmaker that outsources its production to third-party foundries.
How Ambarella silenced the bears
All those challenges made Ambarella seem like a weak investment. However, its year-over-year revenue growth actually accelerated over the past three quarters as its gross margins stabilized:

Ambarella expects its revenue to rise 57%-64% year over year in the third quarter, and for its non-GAAP gross margin to stay between 61%-63%. Wall Street expects Ambarella's revenue and non-GAAP earnings to grow 35% and 185%, respectively, for the full year.
That would mark a major turnaround from its 3% revenue decline and 52% earnings drop last year. Analysts expect its revenue and earnings to rise another 16% and 34%, respectively, in fiscal 2023.
Ambarella mainly attributes that recovery to the growth of its automotive and Internet of Things (IoT) camera markets. Its security camera business in China also stabilized as new customers replaced its blacklisted ones and it gained new customers outside of China.
Ambarella doesn't expect the chip shortage to ease anytime soon, but it still expects the automotive market's gradual recovery, along with demand for more advanced vehicles, to drive its long-term growth.
Ambarella didn't mention Intel in its latest conference calls, but it's likely that Intel's recent strategic shift -- which prioritizes the expansion of its foundries and catching up to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing in the process race instead of the expansion of its non-core businesses -- has made it less of a threat to Ambarella.
But does Ambarella's stock still have room to run?
I was bearish on Ambarella for years, so its performance over the past year caught me by surprise. However, the stock has gotten a bit overheated at 105 times forward earnings and 16 times this year's sales, so it seems doubtful it will replicate those big gains anytime soon.
That being said, Ambarella successfully weathered some severe headwinds over the past six years and repeatedly silenced the critics, who claimed its business would be rendered obsolete by larger chipmakers.
Ambarella has clearly carved out a defensible niche with its image processing SoCs and computer vision chips, and it should continue profiting from the growth of the automotive and IoT camera markets. Therefore, I think Ambarella's stock might be worth nibbling on at these levels -- but investors should be mindful of its frothy valuations.

But over the past year, many of China's top stocks have been crushed by regulatory pressure from both Chinese and American regulators.
China has been reining in its top tech companies with antitrust probes, fines for unapproved acquisitions, a new data protection law, and tighter restrictions for the e-commerce, education, and online gaming industries. Meanwhile, the U.S. plans to delist shares of Chinese companies that don't comply with new auditing rules within the next three years.
All that pressure makes it tough to recommend buying any Chinese stocks. However, shrewd investors can still gain some relatively safe exposure to China through American tech companies that do significant business there. Here are two tech stocks that should profit from China's growth -- while remaining fairly well-insulated from the regulatory and geopolitical headwinds.

Texas Instruments
Texas Instruments (NASDAQ: TXN) is an integrated device manufacturer that designs, manufactures, and sells its own chips. It doesn't rely on third-party foundries because its analog and embedded chips are simpler and less capital-intensive to produce than higher-end chips.
Manufacturing all of its chips in-house prevents TI from getting caught in the traffic jam at third-party foundries like TSMC (NYSE: TSM) amid the global chip shortage, and insulates it from the escalating tech war between China and the U.S. over the production of higher-end chips.
However, TI's analog and embedded chips are still widely used in mobile devices, consumer electronics, communication infrastructure hardware, industrial machines, and cars. It generated about 20% of its revenue from China last year, and two of its 17 plants are located in mainland China.
TI admits that trade tensions and China's development of its own domestic chips could threaten its long-term growth, but it's largely avoided the crossfire that forced other chipmakers like Micron and Skyworks to cut ties with Huawei. TI briefly suspended its shipments to Huawei two years ago, but resumed those sales because many of its products weren't actually affected by the trade blacklist.
TI's revenue rose less than 1% last year as the pandemic disrupted the auto and industrial markets, but its earnings per share still rose 14% as it cut costs and repurchased more shares. This year, analysts expect its revenue and earnings to grow 24% and 36%, respectively, as the pandemic passes and it benefits from easier year-over-year comparisons.
AMD
AMD's (NASDAQ: AMD) revenue from China rose 34% year-over-year to $2.3 billion last year and accounted for 24% of its top line.
AMD has maintained a fairly positive relationship with the Chinese government. It previously ran a joint venture in China which licensed some of its x86 chip designs to Chinese chipmakers, but the business was disrupted by the Trump Administration's trade blacklist two years ago. Recent rumors suggest the Chinese government will also approve AMD's planned takeover of Xilinx (NASDAQ: XLNX) -- which is surprising, since China has a reputation for blocking or postponing big U.S. tech mergers.
Unlike its rival Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), which is an integrated device manufacturer like TI, AMD is a ""fabless"" chipmaker that outsources the production of its CPUs and GPUs to third-party foundries like TSMC and Samsung. AMD's transition to that model, which started after it spun off its foundry unit as GlobalFoundries over a decade ago, enabled it to stay ahead of Intel in the ""process race"" to create smaller and more advanced chips.
AMD's near-term supplies will likely be affected by the chip shortage, but its core businesses remain strong. Its revenue surged 45% in 2020 -- driven by robust demand for its Ryzen CPUs, Epyc server CPUs, Radeon GPUs, and APUs for gaming consoles -- as its adjusted EPS jumped 102%.
This year, analysts expect AMD's revenue and adjusted earnings to rise 60% and 93%, respectively, as it continues to benefit from Intel's sluggish turnaround in the CPU market while keeping pace with Nvidia in the high-end GPU market. Strong sales of the PS5 and Xbox Series S/X consoles -- which all run on AMD's custom APUs -- should complement that growth.
Another road to China
Texas Instruments and AMD are already rock-solid semiconductor stocks. But when we examine their exposure to China and their ability to quietly navigate the tech war without tripping any alarms, we'll notice that both companies also offer investors indirect ways to profit from China's growth.

2021-09-04 00:00:00+00:00,3 5G Stocks to Buy in September,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-5g-stocks-to-buy-in-september-2021-09-04,,,"Although 5G stocks hold tremendous potential for growth, the market has a history of delivering poor performances in September, according to stock research firm CFRA. Considering the statistical pattern, investors looking to add to their portfolios this month may want to lean toward more conservative picks.
Fortunately, the 5G industry includes many lower-risk options. Companies such as Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM), and Verizon (NYSE: VZ) could serve investors well in such a trading environment. Let's take a closer look at these three 5G stocks worth considering in September.
Image source: Getty Images.
1. Intel
Admittedly, Intel might seem like a strange recommendation given its lack of revenue growth in recent years and its loss of technical leadership in the chip industry. However, with former CTO Pat Gelsinger now in the CEO position, the chipmaker is taking steps to revitalize its technology portfolio, incorporating 5G applications in development since before his tenure into the product mix.
Intel has invested heavily in the Internet of Things (IoT), autonomous driving, and data center innovations. It intends to provide users with high bandwidth for video streaming and broadband, low bandwidth for IoT sensors, and the ultra-low latency needed to direct self-driving cars.
It may take time for these efforts to have a positive impact on the company's financials. Revenue fell by 1% year over year to $39.3 billion in the first half of 2021. Also, net income fell 22% during the period to $8.4 billion, due in part to $2.6 billion in restructuring charges.
However, revenues from its IoT and Mobileye businesses grew by 47% and 124%, respectively, and cloud computing delivered a 6% revenue increase. Notably, Intel's P/E ratio of 12 comes in far lower than AMD's P/E of 39 or Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) ratio of 80. Such a valuation not only reduces the risk for those who buy now, it also enhances the growth potential available should 5G help drive an Intel stock price comeback.
2. Qualcomm
Qualcomm occupies a unique position in the 5G industry due to its large and vital portfolio of wireless patents. No manufacturer can build a state-of-the-art smartphone without using Qualcomm's technology.
Additionally, Grand View Research forecasts a compound annual growth rate of 69% for the 5G chipset market, which will make Qualcomm's market position all the more lucrative.
To be sure, competitors are trying to claim some of Qualcomm's market share. Apple bought Intel's smartphone chipset business in 2019, presumably to reduce or eliminate its dependence on Qualcomm. Also, Nvidia continues its efforts to acquire Arm Holdings, which licenses low-power chips to Qualcomm. If Nvidia closes that deal, it could threaten Qualcomm's market position in 5G.
So far, these moves have not slowed Qualcomm. For the first nine months of its fiscal 2021 (which began Sept. 28, 2020), revenue has risen 60% year over year to $24.2 billion. This helped increase income by 179% to $6.2 billion as the company kept its operating expense growth below its revenue growth.
Qualcomm previously forecast some slowing in the current quarter. Still, since guidance calls for revenue of $8.4 billion to $9.2 billion -- about 35% annual growth at the midpoint -- the gains should remain robust.
Despite all this, investors have been relatively tepid about the stock. It has risen 23% over the last 12 months, and its P/E ratio of 18 significantly lags Apple's earnings multiple of 30. Nonetheless, even if Apple or Nvidia become more direct competitors to Qualcomm, industry growth and its current low P/E ratio should make it an appealing buy for whatever market environment lays ahead.
3. Verizon
Verizon is one of only three 5G wireless service providers in the U.S. More importantly, it holds the potential to stand out from peers AT&T and T-Mobile. It has won many awards for service quality, most notably taking J.D. Power's top ranking for network quality for 27 straight years. It has also shown its willingness to invest in maintaining its edge. Early this year, it spent $53 billion on C-band spectrum (including clearing costs and incentive payments). This spectrum will provide the bandwidth needed to improve the quality of its 5G service.
Verizon has also strongly promoted its network-as-a-service (NaaS) offering, a subscription-based wireless service to connect AI, VR, and IoT devices. This has attracted clients such as Honda and Arizona State University.
5G could also serve as a catalyst for Verizon's revenue growth. In the first six months of 2021, its top line rose 7% year over year to $66.6 billion. Additionally, net income of $11.3 billion rose 24%, though that was primarily due to pension reimbursement gains and lower interest expenses.
Even if Verizon's share price languishes, its annual per-share dividend is $2.51 which, at current share prices, yields about 4.6%. That high return in combination with a history of annual payout hikes going back to 2007 offers considerable disincentive to sell. Also, the fact that its P/E ratio of 11 is well below the multiples of AT&T and T-Mobile could discourage sellers.
Admittedly, the company's total debt of $152 billion could leave investors wondering if Verizon stock is a buy, given the $75 billion in equity. However, its low earnings multiple, high dividend, and the potential of its NaaS business may make the telecom's balance sheet weakness worth overlooking.

2021-09-03 00:00:00+00:00,EXCLUSIVE-Tokyo ready to back Western Digital-Kioxia deal if key tech stays in Japan - sources,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/exclusive-tokyo-ready-to-back-western-digital-kioxia-deal-if-key-tech-stays-in-japan,,,"By Tim Kelly and Ritsuko Shimizu
TOKYO, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Japan's trade ministry is ready to back Western Digital's bid to merge with memory chipmaker Kioxia provided control of cutting edge technology stays in Japan, two sources with knowledge of the industry regulator's internal discussions said.
The tie-up could give Japan greater leverage in geopolitical rivalries increasingly dominated by technology, including over shortages of chips. It could also help Japan forge deeper semiconductor industry ties with its U.S. ally, a commitment that President Joe Biden and Prime Minister Suga made in April.
""We will give our support to the indispensable, important semiconductor capacity innovation in Japan,"" one of the sources told Reuters. Western Digital would need to present a plan that both Japan and the United States ""can celebrate,"" the source added, without giving details.
A Western Digital spokesperson in Japan wasn't able to immediately comment.
The U.S. firm needs Japanese government acquiescence for any merger with Kioxia in order to forge a company able to rival South Korea's Samsung Electronics 005930.KS in the NAND flash memory market.
Trade and industry minister Hiroshi Kajiyama has not yet publicly said whether he would back the San Jose, California-based company.
Long seen as hostile to foreign acquisitions, the Ministry of Economy Trade and Industry (METI) is shifting its position, the other source privy to internal discussions said.
""Our strategy on semiconductors means it no longer has to be 100% Japanese. The stance is no longer to reject everything, but to apply conditions instead,"" the source said. ""Kioxia by itself has its limits.""
IPO PLANS
A separate source last month told Reuters a merger agreement may be possible by this month, with Western Digital CEO David Goeckeler seen likely to manage the combined firm.
But for now, Kioxia says it is sticking to a plan to sell itself in an initial public offering (IPO).
""We have said we are preparing to hold the IPO at an appropriate time, and our stance hasn't changed,"" a Kioxia executive told Reuters this week. The company, he added, was in talks with METI officials, which included discussions about support for semiconductor makers.
Kioxia, which relies on Apple Inc AAPL.O for around a quarter of its sales, is planning to hold an IPO in November the Nikkan Kogyo newspaper reported on Friday, citing unidentified sources. .
It cancelled an IPO last year over concerns that Washington-Beijing tensions would squeeze sales to Chinese customers.
Toshiba Corp 6502.T sold Kioxia in 2018 to a consortium led by Bain Capital for $18 billion. The Japanese industrial conglomerate still owns about 40.6% of the chip company.
Whichever course the chipmaker and its owners choose, it will face stiff competition to capture more of a burgeoning market that is being driven by pandemic purchases of electronic devices from people spending more time at home, and by longer-term demand from the advent of 5G connectivity, artificial intelligence and an explosion in data storage.
Kioxia and Western Digital already jointly produce NAND chips, which don't need power to retain data and are commonly used in devices such as smartphones, TVs and data servers.
A combined Kioxia-Western Digital would control 34% of the NAND flash market, putting it on a par with Samsung Electronics. South Korea's SK Hynix Inc 000660.KS and U.S. firms Micron Technology Inc MU.O and Intel Corp INTC.O are the other large players.
SK Hynix is waiting on regulatory approval to acquire Intel's NAND chip business for $9 billion, a hurdle that any Kioxia-Western Digital deal would face not only in Japan and the United States, but from China's State Administration for Market Regulation too. The Chinese antitrust regulator has scuppered semiconductor deals in the past, including Qualcomm Inc's QCOM.O $44 billion bid for NXP Semiconductors NXPI.O in 2018.
""Chinese companies need memory chips from Western Digital and Kioxia. I don't think that the Chinese government will say definitely no,"" the first source said.
Both sources asked not to be identified because they are not authorised to talk to the media.

TOKYO, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Japan's Kioxia Holdings Corp, the world's second-largest maker of NAND flash memory chips, plans to push ahead with an initial public offering (IPO) rather than a stock merger with Western Digital WDC.O, the Nikkan Kogyo newspaper reported on Friday.
Kioxia is planning to offer its shares in November after a general election in Japan because it believes stock markets will rise after that national poll, the Nikkan Kogyo reported, without citing any sources.
Asked about the report, a spokesperson for Kioxia reiterated previous comments by the company it was considering the appropriate timing for an IPO that it shelved in 2020 amid U.S.-China trade tensions.
Kioxia was acquired for $18 billion from Toshiba Corp 6502.T in 2018 by a consortium led by Bain Capital, which declined to comment on Friday. Toshiba retains a 40% stake in the chipmaker.
""We are not involved in Kioxia's management and so not in a position to comment,"" a Toshiba spokesman said. ""We continue to consider the most appropriate approach to our investment in Kioxia in order to maximizing shareholder value.
Reuters reported last month that Kioxia was in advanced talks with Western Digital about a possible $20 billion stock merger with an agreement possible as early as this month, citing a source.
That combination would create a big new company in a consolidating industry. Kioxia earlier declined to comment on that possibility.
Samsung Electronics dominates the market with over a third of NAND sales, according to research firm TrendForce, Kioxia has a nearly 19% share and Western Digital 15%.
Other large players include South Korea's SK Hynix Inc 000660.KS and U.S. firms Micron Technology Inc MU.O and Intel Corp INTC.O.
Hynix is waiting for approval for a deal to acquire Intel, a regulatory step that any Western Digital-Kioxia agreement would also have to clear.
