Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.

2021-07-07 00:00:00+00:00,Will Competition Chip Away at Advanced Micro Devices’ Explosive Growth?,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/will-competition-chip-away-at-advanced-micro-devices-explosive-growth-2021-07-07,,,"Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) is a global semiconductor company that operates two business segments: Computing and Graphics, and Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom.
The main value for AMD comes from intangible assets stemming from its intellectual property. Its x86 instruction set architecture license and expertise in chip design give it duopoly status alongside Intel in the personal computer and server markets. In particular, AMD has recently partnered with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp (TSM) to reduce costs and improve capabilities to create a chip whose competitiveness rivals Intel Corp’s (INTC).
In its most recent quarter, AMD announced its sixth straight quarter of double-digit revenue growth. Growth was strong (93% year-over-year revenue growth) across its business segments and management expects revenue growth to come in at a whopping 50% for fiscal 2021. Furthermore, gross margins were up 100 basis points in the most recent quarter and management forecasts second quarter growth to be nearly as impressive with 86% year-over-year growth. (See Advanced Micro Devices stock charts on TipRanks)
While these numbers are certainly impressive, it should be noted that semiconductors are very cyclical and AMD’s primary competitor – INTC – is currently facing manufacturing challenges, which are potentially temporarily boosting demand for AMD’s products.
Valuation Metrics
In addition to the company’s remarkable growth momentum, its valuation appears quite reasonable. Its forward enterprise value to EBITDA is 32.72x compared to its historical average of 33.71x.
Wall Street’s Take
From Wall Street analysts, AMD earns a Moderate Buy analyst consensus based on 10 Buy ratings, 7 Hold ratings, and 1 Sell rating in the past 3 months. Additionally, the average Advanced Micro Devices price target of $107.50 puts the upside potential at 13.8%.
Summary and Conclusions
AMD is riding strong momentum from rapidly growing demand for its world-class technology. Furthermore, its main rival’s manufacturing challenges and AMD’s recent partnership with TSMC put it in an even stronger position for the near future. Additionally, its valuation remains fairly attractive, and Wall Street analysts are generally bullish on it as well.
That said, investors should retain a healthy dose of caution before going all-in on AMD. The semiconductor industry is highly cyclical, and AMD’s lower scale and heavy dependence on execution excellence in the face of a larger rival mean that its profitability can evaporate quickly. While AMD's strategic partnership with TSMC has helped even the odds in terms of scale, INTC still has greater resources that it can pour into research and development than AMD can. This could put AMD’s long-term competitive positioning at risk.
While AMD certainly has a lot going for it and looks like it could be an attractive buy at current prices, investors should still keep the significant risks and uncertainties in mind when making an investment decision.

As of this week’s opening bell, investors could be eyeing the top tech stocks in the stock market now. After all, tech stocks have and continue to recover from the pullbacks seen earlier this year. In fact, the tech-laden Nasdaq composite is currently up by over 15% year-to-date and gunning towards newer heights. With the wide array of uses for tech in our world today, the industry continues to wow investors across the board. Because of this, it may be wise to keep an eye on the latest movers in the tech world now.
Just last week, Micron Technology (NASDAQ: MU) CEO Sanjay Mehrotra provided a positive update on the semiconductor chip industry. In an interview with CNBC, Mehrotra said that the company is seeing a “healthier and more robust demand environment than ever“. This is mainly thanks to its memory chip tech being used in tandem with semiconductor chips in a wide range of tech industries today. According to Mehrotra, these include the smartphone, automotive, data center, gaming, and industrial markets.
Meanwhile, Chinese tech companies such as Didi (NYSE: DIDI) and Weibo (NASDAQ: WB) continue to make headlines in the stock market today. On one hand, Didi is facing regulatory pressure from the Chinese government due to cybersecurity issues. This would highlight the growing demand for digital security services and provide the top cybersecurity stocks with more momentum. On the other hand, Twitter (NYSE: TWTR) competitor Weibo is reportedly looking to go private via a deal that values it at about $20 billion. With all of this activity in the tech space today, I can understand if investors are keen on tech stocks now. If you are one of them, here are four top tech stocks worth knowing now.

The stock market may be volatile at times, but it’s safe to say it has been a good year thus far for investors. Sure, tech stocks have experienced some pullbacks over the past few months. But it is also for this reason that the sector appears to be presenting buying opportunities. After all, most of the top growth stocks are stemming from the tech industry and tech companies continue to make huge strides this year.
Investors continue to understand that innovation will always be a key factor in promoting growth. This has resulted in the industry being considered one of the driving forces behind the bullish stock market we have witnessed in the past decade. If you’re looking for the top tech stocks to buy and hold for the long run, some may prefer those that can survive periods of soft demand and high unemployment. 
As the economy reopens, investors may find themselves in a position where they have to choose between cyclical stocks and tech stocks. Of course, it is possible that some tech stocks will also benefit from the reopening of the economy. With that in mind, could these five tech stocks fit the criteria in the stock market right now?

Cisco Systems Inc.
Cisco is a multinational tech company that engages in designing and selling a range of technologies across networking, security, collaboration, applications, and the cloud. The company seems primed to grow as it develops technologies such as 5G, Wi-Fi 6, and the 400 gigabit Ethernet. The adoption of said technologies with an improving IT environment could accelerate spending on networks. We could see an increase in revenue driven by a return to offices, increased adoption of hybrid cloud networks, and the company’s increasing participation in public cloud infrastructure. In a post-Covid era, Cisco could still be an attractive asset.
The company’s high-margin software division is rapidly expanding. In the most recent quarter, Cisco generated almost $4 billion in software revenue, growing 13% year-over-year which is close to 30% of total revenue. Subscriptions accounted for more than 80% of Cisco’s software sales, providing a steady flow of cash. Cisco’s move to software may enable it to increase profitability at a faster rate than revenue. Given all that, would you consider buying CSCO stock?

Verizon Communications Inc.
Next up we have telecommunications giant, Verizon. Like its rivals, Verizon has been hard at work adopting 5G technology. It is well-positioned to meet rising customer demand for improved networks and services. Despite that, VZ stock has been trading sideways for the past few months. Could these be a chance for investors to buy on dips?
The company reported steady first-quarter revenue with 4% year-over-year growth to $32.9 billion. This would mark its second consecutive quarter where the company grew its revenue on both its wireless equipment and other services segments. Verizon had a strong cash flow performance in the first quarter, with $5.2 billion in free cash flow. Investors receive $2.51 per share in dividends each year as a result of these cash flows, an almost 4.5% yield. Investors who prefer consistent growth and rising dividends might want to consider VZ stock.

Intel Corporation
Intel is a company that engages in designing and manufacturing products and technologies for cloud, smart, and connected devices. The company is set to begin production of its new version of Xeon server chip line in the first quarter of 2022 with a ramp-up by the second quarter. The chip code-named “Sapphire Rapids” could substantially widen Intel’s already vast lead in AI performance. The company expects the chip to improve AI performance by four to eight folds which could provide Intel with a more competitive advantage over rivals.
On another note, Intel has agreed to use SiFive’s RISC-V IP in Intel’s new foundries under a new licensing agreement. Without going into details of the technical jargon, the move by Intel could be an important first step to address consumers’ demand to produce chips with the same performance but lower power consumption. With the developments surrounding Intel, would you put INTC stock on your watchlist?

2021-07-03 00:00:00+00:00,5 Top Stocks for July,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/5-top-stocks-for-july-2021-07-03,,,"Summer is officially here. School is out, consumers are traveling, and in some parts of the world, things are getting back to normal.
We asked five of our top contributors to share a stock idea before they head out for summer vacation. Here's why they highlighted Ayr Wellness (OTC: AYRW.F), Illumina (NASDAQ: ILMN), Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), Nano-X Imaging (NASDAQ: NNOX), and Fiserv (NASDAQ: FISV) as top opportunities.

This stock has growth in its DNA
Todd Campbell (Illumina): Genetics and genomics are reshaping how we diagnose, treat, and manage disease and arguably, no company has contributed more to advances in health enabled by DNA research than Illumina. Since launching its first DNA sequencing machine in 2007, Illumina has grown into the market share leading provider of systems used by laboratories to understand how genetic differences contribute to disease.
Today, over 17,000 Illumina instruments are being used for DNA discovery globally. Nonprofits are using them to gain greater insight into genetic variations within populations big and small, while for-profit drug developers are using them to develop new treatments for rare and common diseases, including cancer. DNA tests are helping patients and doctors make more informed decisions regarding treatment plans and increasingly, they're helping would-be parents with fertility decisions. In the future, simple liquid biopsy DNA tests designed to spot cancer in its earliest stages could become as standard as cholesterol screening, and regular DNA testing could be used to ensure cancer remains in remission.
This growing market opportunity is fueling significant growth at Illumina. In 2020, the company reported $3.2 billion in revenue and in 2021, management expects revenue to grow at least 25%. Importantly, the company is highly profitable because each test done on one of its systems requires high-margin disposable products such as reagents. In 2020, these disposables accounted for 71% of revenue and in the first quarter of 2021, Illumina's earnings per share grew 15% year over year to $1.89.
Since genetics and genomics is significantly disrupting healthcare and Illumina is positioned perfectly as a leading supplier to this fast-growing industry, I think picking up its shares now could be smart.
High risk, high reward
Brian Feroldi (Nano-X Imaging): X-rays have been around for more than 120 years, so you might be shocked to learn that two-thirds of the world's population still does not have access to medical imaging technology. Why? The reason is that traditional medical imaging systems are too expensive, too big, and too complex.
Nano-X Imaging wants to change that. The company has invented a new type of x-ray technology that holds promise to drop the cost of medical imaging by an order of magnitude. In fact, Nano-X believes its technology will bring down the cost of production so much that it will be able to give its systems away for free. Nano-X will then charge its customers a small fee each time they perform a scan. If it wins regulatory approval, Nano-X's technology holds promise to be extremely disruptive and bring medical imaging technology to the world.
The keyword in that last sentence is ""if."" Nano-X hasn't yet won FDA clearance for its commercial system -- although it did gain FDA clearance for a key part of its technology -- so there are no guarantees that this technology will ever see the light of day. We should know whether or not Nano-X will gain FDA clearance before the end of 2021, so investors won't have to wait long to know more. In fact, management believes it will start shipping units by the first quarter of 2021 and it will have 15,000 systems up and running by the end of 2024.
How big could the pie be if Nano-X's technology and business model prove to be a success? There's no way to know for sure, but I think 10-plus-bagger returns are entirely possible given that this company is currently valued at $1.6 billion.
Make no mistake: Nano-X is an extremely speculative company at this point. However, given the huge potential, I decided to make this innovative healthcare stock a tiny part of my portfolio. If you are after a high-risk, high-reward investment, Nano-X might appeal to you, too.
Don't count this chipmaker out
Tim Green (Intel): The past few years for chipmaker Intel have been plagued with chronic manufacturing issues and the rising fortunes of rival Advanced Micro Devices. Intel has struggled to bring its 10-nanometer manufacturing process to volume production, launching 14nm gaming CPUs as recently as this year. This has opened the door for AMD to steal market share thanks in part to the manufacturing prowess of third-party foundry Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing.
Intel is not giving up on manufacturing. In fact, the company is doubling down on what it views as a critical component of its business. Intel plans to pour $20 billion into new factories, fueling both its own product ambitions and a new foundry business. Making chips for other companies has become a lucrative business, propelling TSMC into the ranks of the world's largest chipmakers. Intel wants a piece of that action.
Intel's plans will take years to play out, and there's no guarantee that the strategy will pay off. But investors can buy Intel stock today at an attractive price and get the chance for a major resurgence down the road. Intel is valued at about $225 billion and produced $21.1 billion of free cash flow last year. That number will drop to just over $10 billion in 2021 as the company ramps up its investments, but that's still not a bad deal given Intel's potential to break into the third-party foundry business.
Intel probably isn't going to give you a 1,000% return. But a low price and solid long-term potential make it a tech stock worth buying in July.
A fintech set to bounce back
Adam Levy (Fiserv): As retail sales pick back up and consumers move away from using cash, opting for credit and debit cards instead, Fiserv stands to gain. Both its merchant acceptance and payment processing segments benefit from more card payments in stores and online, and Fiserv holds significant scale in both businesses.
What's more, its small business payment processing solution, Clover, is growing rapidly despite the headwinds of 2020. Clover, similar to Square's seller solutions, is bigger and growing faster than Square. Gross payment volume (GPV) grew 36% in the first quarter to about $35 billion versus 29% growth and $33 billion in GPV at Square.
Meanwhile, Fiserv's core processing business in its fintech segment should remain a stable source of revenue, as switching costs are very high for the banks it serves. The biggest risk to that segment is bank mergers. Fiserv's customers tend to be smaller banks that are more likely acquisition targets.
Overall, the expected revenue growth in its most scalable businesses combined with realized synergies from the First Data acquisition should lead to very strong operating margin expansion and earnings growth. Management is calling for a more than 500 basis point improvement in operating margin by 2023. While operating income remains temporarily depressed and uncertainty about inflation (which has minimal impact on Fiserv's business anyway) keeps the stock price down, now is a great time to buy shares of Fiserv.
A cannabis bargain
Keith Speights (Ayr Wellness): Generally speaking, marijuana stocks are pretty expensive. However, I think Ayr Wellness is practically a bargain compared to most of its peers. Its shares trade at less than five times sales -- lower than the price-to-sales multiple of all but one major U.S. multi-state operator and much better than all of the top Canadian cannabis producers.
Of course, a low valuation doesn't necessarily make a stock a great pick. But Ayr isn't just cheap; it also offers tremendous growth prospects. The company's revenue soared 74% year over year in the first quarter of 2021 to $58.4 million. Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) skyrocketed 136% to $18.4 million.
I look for Ayr's growth to accelerate thanks in large part to its wheeling and dealing. The company completed its acquisition of Liberty Health Sciences in February, giving it the fourth-largest retail network in Florida's booming medical cannabis market. Ayr closed on acquisitions in Arizona and Ohio in March.
The multi-state operator doesn't have to rely solely on acquisitions to fuel growth, though. The cannabis markets in the states where it currently operates continue to expand. Ayr is capitalizing on this growth by opening new dispensaries.
Efforts are under way to advance major cannabis reform legislation through the U.S. Congress. This could pave the way for Ayr to list its shares on a U.S. stock exchange in the not-too-distant future. If substantial progress is made on this front, I think Ayr's share price could realistically double by the end of 2021.

2021-07-02 00:00:00+00:00,3 Reasons Qualcomm's New Snapdragon Chip Didn't Impress Investors,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-reasons-qualcomms-new-snapdragon-chip-didnt-impress-investors-2021-07-02,,,"Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM) recently upgraded its most powerful mobile chipset, the Snapdragon 888, with a ""Plus"" version that increases its clock speed by 5% to nearly 3.0 GHz and boosts its AI processing power by about 20%. Its GPU speed will remain unchanged.
Qualcomm revealed the 888 Plus at this year's Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, and said the chipset will start powering higher-end phones from ASUS, Honor, Lenovo's Motorola, Vivo, and Xiaomi (OTC: XIACF) in the second half of 2021.
Image source: Qualcomm.
Qualcomm's stock barely budged after the announcement, and the tech pundits were similarly unimpressed. Ars Technica's Ron Amadeo, for example, declared Qualcomm did the ""bare minimum"" in its Plus upgrade for the 888, and called its AI improvements ""ambiguous"". Let's review the three main reasons Qualcomm's newest chip isn't impressing investors.
1. The weakest Plus upgrade to date
The Snapdragon 888 Plus, like the 855 Plus in 2019 and 865 Plus in 2020, represents a half-step upgrade instead of a generational leap forward.
However, the 888 Plus is a less significant upgrade than the 855 Plus, which installed a 15% faster GPU than its predecessor, and the 865 Plus, which boosted the original 865's CPU and GPU speeds by 10%.
2. It's not enough to counter MediaTek
Qualcomm plans to follow up the Snapdragon 888 with a next-gen 4nm chip, but TSMC (NYSE: TSM) won't start mass producing 4nm chips until 2022. Therefore, the 888 Plus needs to hold down the fort for about another year against MediaTek (OTC: MDTKF), which actually overtook Qualcomm as the world's top mobile chipmaker over the past year.
Between the first quarters of 2020 and 2021, MediaTek's market share in mobile application processors rose from 24% to 35%, according to Counterpoint Research, while Qualcomm's share slipped from 31% to 29%.
Image source: MediaTek.
MediaTek previously focused on lower-end to mid-range devices, but it's been gradually expanding its lineup of high-end mobile chips to challenge Qualcomm.
MediaTek's top-tier Dimensity 1200 actually offers a higher clock speed than the original Snapdragon 888 at roughly a third of its price. The Snapdragon 888 still slightly beats the Dimensity 1200, which is manufactured on the 6nm node, across most industry benchmarks -- but some OEMs are likely willing to sacrifice a little performance for much higher margins. Xiaomi, Oppo, and Realme have already launched Dimensity 1200 phones since the chipset's launch earlier this year.
We've seen a similar conflict play out in the PC CPU market with Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) and AMD (NASDAQ: AMD). AMD crept up on Intel with cheaper chips that offered comparable performance, then pulled ahead in the process race after Intel suffered a series of manufacturing setbacks.
I'm not saying Qualcomm will suffer the same fate as Intel, but its market share losses and deceleration in technological upgrades should raise a few red flags. Furthermore, the ongoing chip shortage might constrain Qualcomm's supply of next-gen 4nm Snapdragons next year, which could cause even more OEMs to buy MediaTek's chips.
3. Ambiguous AI hype
Qualcomm claims its sixth-generation ""AI Engine"" will deliver up to 32 TOPS (tera operations per second) AI performance, representing a 20% improvement over its predecessor, and that the upgrade will power ""AI-enhanced gameplay, streaming, photography, and more.""
That opaque measurement reflects the combined performance of Qualcomm's CPU, GPU, DSP (digital signal processor), and software for certain AI tasks, which is difficult for individual users to replicate and probably not too useful for everyday smartphone tasks. Therefore, Qualcomm seemingly mentioned its AI improvements to mask the fact the 888 Plus' main upgrade was a 5% boost to its clock speed.
The key takeaways
On its own, the market's tepid response to Qualcomm's newest Snapdragon chip doesn't indicate it's a bad investment. However, investors should realize Qualcomm still faces tough competition from MediaTek, and a minor upgrade probably won't rally the bulls and tilt the scales in the right direction.

2021-07-01 00:00:00+00:00,FOCUS-Qualcomm's new CEO eyes dominance in the laptop markets,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/focus-qualcomms-new-ceo-eyes-dominance-in-the-laptop-markets-2021-07-01,,,"By Stephen Nellis
July 1 (Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc's QCOM.O new chief thinks that by next year his company will have just the chip for laptop makers wondering how they can compete with Apple Inc AAPL.O, which last year introduced laptops using a custom-designed central processor chip that boasts longer battery life.
Longtime processor suppliers Intel Corp INTC.O and Advanced Micro Devices AMD.O have no chips as energy efficient as Apple's. Qualcomm Chief Executive Cristiano Amon told Reuters on Thursday he believes his company can have the best chip on the market, with help from a team of chip architects who formerly worked on the Apple chip but now work at Qualcomm.
In his first interview since taking the top job at San Diego, California-based Qualcomm, Amon also said the company is also counting on revenue growth from China to power its core smartphone chip business despite political tensions.
""We will go big in China,"" he said, noting that U.S. sanctions on Huawei Technologies Co Ltd HWT.UL give Qualcomm an opportunity to generate a lot more revenue.
Amon said a cornerstone of his strategy comes from a lesson learned in the smartphone chip market: It was not enough just to provide modem chips for phones wireless data connectivity. Qualcomm also needed to provide the brains to turn the phone into a computer, which it now does for most premium Android devices.
Now, as Qualcomm looks to push 5G connectivity into laptops, it is pairing modems with a powerful central processor unit, or CPU, Amon said. Instead of using computing core blueprints from longtime partner Arm Ltd, as it now does for smartphones, Qualcomm concluded it needed custom-designed chips if its customers were to rival new laptops from Apple.
As head of Qualcomm's chip division, Amon this year led the $1.4 billion acquisition of startup Nuvia, whose ex-Apple founders help design some those Apple laptop chips before leaving to form the startup. Qualcom will start selling Nuvia-based laptop chips next year.
""We needed to have the leading performance for a battery-powered device,"" Amon said. ""If Arm, which we've had a relationship with for years, eventually develops a CPU that's better than what we can build ourselves, then we always have the option to license from Arm.""
Arm is in the midst of being purchased by Nvidia Corp NVDA.O for $40 billion, a merger that Qualcomm has objected to with regulators.
Amon said Qualcomm has no plans to build its own products to enter the other big market for CPUs - data centers for cloud computing companies. But it will license Nuvia's designs to cloud computing companies that want to build their own chips, which could put it in competition with parts of Arm.
""We are more than willing to leverage the Nuvia CPU assets to partner with companies that are interested as they build the data center solutions,"" Amon said.

Phone chips accounted for $12.8 billion of its $16.5 billion in chip revenue in its most recent fiscal year. Some of Qualcomm's best customers, such as phone maker Xiaomi Corp 1810.HK, are in China.
Qualcomm is counting on revenue growth as its Android handset customers swoop in on former users of phones from Huawei, which was forced out of the handset market by Washington's sanctions.
Kevin Krewell, principal analyst at TIRIAS Research, called it a ""political minefield"" due to rising U.S.-China tensions. But Amon said the company could do business as usual there.
""We license our technology - we don't have to do forced joint ventures with technology transfers. Our customers in China are current with their agreements, so you see respect for American intellectual property,"" he said.
Another major challenge for Amon will be hanging on to Apple as a customer. Qualcomm's modem chips are now in all Apple iPhone 12 models after a bruising legal battle. Apple sued Qualcomm in 2017 but eventually dropped its claims and signed chip supply and patent license agreements with Qualcomm in 2019.
Apple is now designing chips to displace Qualcomm's communications chips in iPhones.
""The biggest overhang for Qualcomm's long-term stock multiple is the worry that right now, it's as good as it gets, because they're shipping into all the iPhones, but someday, Apple will do those chips internally,"" said Michael Walkley, a senior analyst at Canaccord Genuity Group.
Amon said that Qualcomm has decades of experience designing modem chips that will be hard for any rival to replicate and that the void in the Android market left by Huawei.
""Just for the premium tier alone, the Huawei addressable market is as big as the Apple opportunity is for us,"" Amon said.
Another challenge for Amon, a gregarious executive who is energetic onstage during keynote presentations, will be that Qualcom is not well known to consumers in the way that Intel or Nvidia are, even in Qualcomm's hometown.
""I flew into San Diego and got an Uber driver at the airport and told him I was going to Qualcomm. He said, 'You mean the stadium?'"" Krewell said, referring to the football arena formerly home to the San Diego Chargers.
Amon has started a new branding program for the company's Snapdragon smartphone chips to try to change that.
""We have a mature smartphone industry today. People care what's behind the glass,"" he said.

2021-06-30 00:00:00+00:00,Why AMD Stock Popped Today,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-amd-stock-popped-today-2021-06-30,,,"What happened
Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) rose 4.9% on Wednesday, following positive analyst commentary.
So what
On Tuesday, Wells Fargo analyst Aaron Rakers reiterated his overweight rating on the chipmaker's stock. He argued that rival Intel's (NASDAQ: INTC) production delays for its most advanced chips are an opportunity for AMD to continue to gain share in the massive server market.
Wall Street is growing more bullish on Advanced Micro Devices' stock. Image source: Getty Images.
Today, Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya also repeated his buy rating on AMD's shares. Arya believes the bears are overstating the competitive risks posed by rival chipmakers. Moreover, with AMD underperforming both the S&P 500 and the PHLX Semiconductor Sector Index so far in 2021, he posits that its stock price has ""catch-up potential"" in the year ahead.
Now what
Intel's struggles have been a boon for AMD. Share gains in the server CPU market have helped to drive AMD's sales and profits sharply higher. Its revenue and net income soared 93% and 243%, respectively, to $3.4 billion and $555 million, in the first quarter of 2021.
Intel's manufacturing delays could allow AMD to take even more market share in this important segment. If they do, the chipmaker's financial results will likely continue to impress investors in the coming quarters.

Walmart enters $10 billion insulin market
Image source: Getty Images.
Leading the Dow higher today are shares of mega-retailer Walmart, which announced on June 29 it had partnered with Novo Nordisk to offer a Walmart-branded insulin and injection device under the ReliOn brand name. The company is flexing its scale to offer this product at a significant discount. It will price insulin at $72.88 per vial and its FlexPen injector at $85.88, a discount it claims is between 58% and 75% lower than the cash price of competing insulin products currently available.
Diabetes is an expensive health condition to manage. According to the CEO of the American Diabetes Association, quoted in Walmart's press release, medical care related to diabetes costs an estimated $7,000 per year on average. Despite the cost, managing diabetes is a growing business. With its massive retail footprint and changing demographics leading to an increase in the number of Americans with diabetes, Walmart's scale could play a crucial role in helping it win significant market share.
Investors certainly seem to think that's the case, sending shares higher today.

Boeing's big United deal driving stock higher
After steadily shrinking over the past year, orders of Boeing's 737 MAX aircraft have finally started to grow again. And you can now add United Airlines to the list of air lines signing big orders for the aircraft. According to the deal, United accelerated delivery for dozens of orders already in place and ordered another 200 737 MAX for future delivery.
While the announcement came out on June 29, it's been expected for quite some time, and Boeing stock actually fell yesterday. News about the Delta variant of the novel coronavirus and the potential return to lockdowns in response to a surge in cases may have overshadowed confirmation of United's big order. Investors likely sold in fear that a return to lockdowns could undo the recovery in air travel.
What's still unclear is how much economic value this deal will deliver for Boeing. Adding hundreds of new orders to its backlog is great news for the company, but it is likely that United is receiving a significant discount with this large order.
Intel's turnaround hits a snag
Intel's stock is on track to fall close to 2% today after a company blog post disclosed that it was delaying production of its Sapphire Rapids server chips to 2022. Sapphire Rapids had been expected to start rolling out of Intel's manufacturing facilities later this year.
This is the first big setback for the semiconductor giant since Pat Gelsinger took the reins as CEO in February. Gelsinger has announced an aggressive plan to turn the company around by expanding its global manufacturing footprint, shifting away from its proprietary focus, and becoming more closely aligned with companies looking to design their own chips.
Intel's delay in producing its 7-nanometer microprocessors has put the company at a serious performance disadvantage in relation to some of its peers. Though not as publicized, this latest delay impacts the company's hugely important -- and hugely profitable -- server business. While Gelsinger may have some great plans to turn Intel around, the hard part -- actually executing on those plans -- has only just begun.

When looking for stocks to buy, why not take some notes from politicians on Capitol Hill? Elected officials in Washington, D.C. are free to buy and sell stocks provided they follow strict disclosure rules and act in an ethical manner. The STOCK Act of 2012 forbids Congressional insider trading on the part of members of the House of Representatives and Senate, which is defined as the use of nonpublic information for one’s financial benefit.
However, the law does not prevent members of Congress from buying and selling shares of companies affected by the legislation they write and the laws they vote in favor of. For this reason, critics say the STOCK Act does not go far enough.

7 Triple A-Rated Stocks to Buy for the Second Half of 2021
However, members of Congress are required to disclose holdings in their stock portfolios, providing a glimpse into how lawmakers view what is happening on Wall Street. In this article, we take a look at seven of the most widely held and frequently traded stocks among U.S. Senators, based on data provided from the website “Senate Trading.”

Stocks to Buy: Intel (INTC)

Some of the most recent and frequent trading made by various senators has been in Silicon Valley-based semiconductor company Intel. While Intel no longer dominates the semiconductor space like it once did, the company has seen its share price get a boost this year as the world grapples with a shortage of microchips and semiconductors used in everything from cars to computers. Year-to-date, INTC stock is up 12% to $55.65 a share.
Intel continues to struggle financially. The chipmaker continues to lose market share to competitors and customers who are designing their own microchips. The company’s most recent quarterly results showed that Intel’s Data Center Group generated first-quarter sales of $5.6 billion, down 20% from a year earlier. Intel’s gross margin, the percentage of revenue remaining after the cost of production, was 55.2%, down five percentage points from the same period of 2020.
On the positive side, Intel has announced that it plans to resume manufacturing microchips again, as well as designing them, promising to spend $20 billion to develop new U.S.-based foundries.
The Trade Desk (TTD)

There was plenty of buying and selling of digital advertising company The Trade Desk in the lead-up to the company’s 10-for-1 stock split that was executed on June 16. It was the first split of TTD stock since the company went public in 2016, and it brought the share price down from nearly $600 to $59.02.
Since the split, the stock has jumped 29% in short order, growing to nearly $79 as of June 30. The rise has come as retail investors grab shares now that they are more affordable. Additionally, there are expectations that online advertising will recover and boom coming out of the pandemic in this year’s second half.

The Trade Desk has proven to be a strong performer and a reliable growth stock. Since 2017, The Trade Desk’s revenue has increased fourfold, and its net income has grown an incredible 12-fold. Even last year, at the height of the pandemic, The Trade Desk managed to grow its revenue 26% on an annualized basis, driven by advertisements from retailers targeting people shopping online and political advertisements during the U.S. elections last fall.
Stocks to Buy: Peloton (PTON)

Another actively traded stock among senators is exercise-equipment-maker Peloton. The New York City-based company that makes exercise bikes and treadmills saw its share price skyrocket last year as gyms and fitness clubs were forced to close and people began exercising at home.
At $125.09 per share, PTON stock is up nearly 118% in the last 52 weeks. However, year-to-date, the share price is down about 18%. The economic reopening has investors betting that people will soon return to their local gym, and Peloton will be unable to maintain its sales growth.
Another black mark that has hurt PTON shares is a massive recall of the company’s Tread+ treadmill after it was found to have injured nearly 30 children and killed one child. After weeks of denials and delays (and bad PR), Peloton announced that it will recall 125,000 of the treadmills at a cost to its bottom line of $165 million. Peloton said the $165 million includes $105 million in missed sales and $50 million that will go to paying refunds to people who want to return the recalled treadmills, which cost $4,200 each to purchase.
The negative publicity surrounding the treadmill injuries and subsequent recall appeared to prompt heavy trading of the stock among U.S. senators this spring.
Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-B)

Famed investor Warren Buffett is often critical of elected officials in Washington, D.C., criticizing everything from the deficit and tax policies to the salaries and office budgets of senators and representatives. However, despite his criticisms, senators seem to have no qualms about buying shares of Buffett’s holding company Berkshire Hathaway. The more affordable Class-B shares of Berkshire Hathaway are among the most widely held by U.S. senators. At $278 each, BRK-B shares are up 20% year-to-date.
Perhaps senators like the diversification they get with BRK-B stock. Berkshire Hathaway does after all own a multitude of businesses ranging from railroads to insurance companies, and even the Dairy Queen restaurant chain. Or perhaps they admire the massive and heavily diversified stock portfolio that Berkshire Hathaway owns. The company is, after all, one of the largest shareholders of Apple, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and Coca-Cola Co (NYSE:KO).

Stocks to Buy: Wells Fargo (WFC)

Wells Fargo has been one of the best performing bank stocks this year, up 50% year-to-date at $45.13 a share. And senators in Washington, D.C. certainly seem to have taken notice. Seen largely as a turnaround story after enduring a painful “fake accounts” scandal that cost the bank $3 billion in legal settlements, Wells Fargo has risen this year with the broader banking sector. Investors like the environment for banks now that consumer spending is increasing and interest rates are expected to rise in the medium term.
Wells Fargo got a recent lift after the U.S. Federal Reserve announced that America’s largest banks easily passed its latest stress test and are now free to once again distribute capital to shareholders in the form of dividend payments as well as stock buybacks. Wall Street estimates indicate that the six biggest U.S. banks, including Wells Fargo, could return more than $140 billion to shareholders beginning after stock markets closed on June 28, and payouts are expected to be the largest ever. Investors understandably cheered this news, sending bank stocks higher.
Apple (AAPL)

Consumer-technology giant Apple is one of the most widely held stocks in the world and has the biggest weighting on the Dow Jones Industrial Average. AAPL stock is also one of only two stocks on the Dow, along with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), that enjoys a $2 trillion market capitalization. Given its heft and influence, it should come as no surprise that the iPhone maker is a favorite holding of American senators.
And yet, despite its pedigree and influence, Apple stock has been a laggard this year when compared to other stocks. After a strong performance in 2020 and a four-for-one stock split last August, AAPL stock is up only a slight 3% year-to-date, and the share price currently sits at $136.62. The tepid growth comes despite the company issuing a slew of new products, including its 5G wireless-enabled iPhone 12 that analysts see ushering in a “super cycle” of sales for the company.

10 Best Stocks to Buy to Build Up Passive Income Streams
Most industry observers chalk up the stunted growth of Apple’s stock price this year to investors focusing more on cyclical stocks that will do well as the economy surges ahead. But it likely won’t be long before AAPL stock experiences a new breakout.
Stocks to Buy: Halliburton (HAL)

Now for a blast from the past. Remember Halliburton? The Duncan, Oklahoma-based oil field services company made headlines frequently during the administration of former President George W. Bush for its close ties to then-Vice President Dick Cheney, and for its ability to land lucrative U.S. government contracts in the Middle East, notably Iraq. The company has been prosecuted by the U.S. Justice Department in the past for paying bribes to government officials in foreign countries to secure contracts.
In 2007, Halliburton sold its KBR division, the contracting, engineering and construction unit that had caused much of the controversy. Today, Halliburton is primarily focused on servicing oil fields in the U.S. and Middle East.
And while it no longer attracts the same amount of media interest that it once did, Halliburton remains a popular stock among U.S. senators. With oil prices on the rebound and the energy sector recovering from the pandemic, HAL stock has increased 22% year-to-date and now trades at $23.08 a share. In the past year, the stock price is up 86%.

Earlier this month I wrote about the prospect that Nokia (NYSE:NOK), the Finnish telecom company, will pay a dividend at the end of the year. Based on those projections, I put the value of NOK stock at $6.63 per share.

In this article, I’ll show how Nokia’s own free cash flow (FCF) guidance leads to just about the same price target (in fact, a little higher). This means that NOK stock, which closed at $5.36 on June 29, is worth at least 25% more.
It is actually very simple to come up with this conclusion. The reason is Nokia gave very concrete guidance on page 2 of its most recent earnings release on April 29. Here is how those projections work out.
Free Cash Flow Projections
The basic guidance on free cash flow from Nokia can be worked out from the following specific guidance:
“In full year 2021, Nokia expects the free cash flow performance of Nokia Technologies to be approximately EUR 600 million lower than its operating profit, primarily due to prepayments we received from certain licensees;”

7 of the Hottest Energy Stocks to Buy This Summer
So to determine the company’s 2021 FCF all we have to do is estimate its operating profit and then subtract EUR 600 million. Luckily, Nokia also provided guidance about operating profit. It provided a table that indicated the operating margin would be between 7% and 10%. In addition, sales for 2021 are forecast by Nokia to be between EUR 20.6 billion to EUR 21.8 billion.
So using these numbers, here is how we can estimate FCF. First, let’s assume that sales will be at the midpoint, or EUR 21.2 billion. At $1.19 per EUR, that works out to $25.228 billion. Then, we take 8.5% of that (i.e., the midpoint between 7% and 10% operating margin), to derive $2.144 billion in forecast operating profit.
Next, we subtract $714 million (i.e. EUR 600 million x $1.19) from operating profits of $2.144. The result: $1.430 billion in FCF for 2021.
If we use a 10% margin and apply it to the upper end of sales (EUR 21.9 billion), the FCF figure works out to $1.994 billion. So FCF will be somewhere between $1.43 billion and $1.994 billion. We can use that to estimate the value of NOK stock.
What Nokia Is Worth
For simplicity’s sake, let’s conservatively assume that FCF will be between $1.5 billion and $1.6 billion, or $1.55 billion. Now if we use a 4.0% FCF yield metric, we can estimate the value of Nokia stock.
So dividing $1.55 billion by 4.0% results in a target market capitalization of $38.75 billion. This is 25.73% more than the market cap of $30.82 billion as of June 29. In other words, NOK stock is worth 25.73% more, or $6.74 per share.
Note that this is very close to my original estimate of $6.63 per share, based on a projected 4.75% dividend yield. That yield was determined as the midpoint between Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and AT&T (NYSE:T).
So now we have two different economic models to determine the value of NOK stock. Both of them project that it is worth about 25% more.
What To Do With NOK Stock
My projected target value is higher than Wall Street analyst predictions. For example, TipRanks reports that 11 analysts have an average target price of $5.84, or 9% above today’s price. This is similar to what Seeking Alpha projects as well. Their survey of 12 analysts shows that the average price target is $5.40, close to the price on June 29 of $5.36.
Let’s say there is a 40% chance that analysts are right and a 50% chance I am right, with the remainder 10% with a market return (say 15%). Here is how that works out.
The total expected return will be 40% x 9%, or 3.6%, from the analysts’ estimate. Using my 25% expected return, at a 50% chance of it being right, the outcome is 12.5%. Finally, the 10% chance that the stock will earn a market return of 15% leaves an expected return of 1.5%.
So, adding up all three of these possibilities results in a total expected return of 17.6% (i.e., 3.6% +12.5%+1.5% = 17.6%). So the probability-weighted target price for NOK stock is $6.30 (i.e., $5.36 x 1.176). That is the result of 2 of my models (dividend and FCF based), analysts’ estimates, and a market return. That’s a pretty good return for most investors.

2021-06-29 00:00:00+00:00,Intel Corporation's (NASDAQ:INTC) Intrinsic Value Is Potentially 63% Above Its Share Price,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intel-corporations-nasdaq%3Aintc-intrinsic-value-is-potentially-63-above-its-share-price,,,"Does the June share price for Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.
We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model.
Step by step through the calculation
We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.
Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:
10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate

Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x13 Analyst x13 Analyst x3 Analyst x1 Analyst x1 Est @ 9.9% Est @ 7.53% Est @ 5.87% Est @ 4.7% Est @ 3.89%

(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)
Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$135b
We now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.7%.
Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2030 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$29b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (7.7%– 2.0%) = US$512b
Present Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$512b÷ ( 1 + 7.7%)10= US$244b
The total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$379b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$57.5, the company appears quite undervalued at a 39% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.
NasdaqGS:INTC Discounted Cash Flow June 29th 2021
The assumptions
Now the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Intel as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.7%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.210. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.
Moving On:
Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price?

While NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock has roared higher on the back of a strong showing from its gaming and data center businesses, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) stock price has failed to sustain its terrific momentum from 2020 and headed south. Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) stock, meanwhile, has pulled back over the past couple of months as its April quarterly report gave rise to a bunch of red flags.
AMD data by YCharts
Does this mean NVIDIA is the one you should be buying? Or will AMD's and Intel's fortunes turn around in the second half of the year, making them potentially better buys than the richly valued NVIDIA? Let's find out.
NVIDIA: Benefitting from long-term growth catalysts
It is safe to say that NVIDIA is firing on all cylinders, as almost all the company's business segments registered eye-popping growth in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. Barring the automotive business, which saw a 1% revenue decline, the gaming, data center, professional visualization, and OEM (original equipment manufacturer) segments recorded varying degrees of impressive growth during the quarter.
As a result, NVIDIA's total Q1 revenue jumped 84% year over year to $5.66 billion, while non-GAAP earnings more than doubled to $3.66 per share. The company's guidance was also a solid one, with its estimated second-quarter revenue of $6.3 billion expected to increase nearly 63% year over year at the midpoint of its guidance range.

NVIDIA can sustain such high rates of growth beyond 2021 as the data center and gaming markets, which account for nearly 85% of the total revenue, are sitting on long-term catalysts. The data center segment's revenue hit $2 billion for the first time last quarter, recording 79% growth over the year-ago period. NVIDIA credits the segment's outstanding growth to strong demand from hyperscale customers deploying its GPUs (graphics processing units) for artificial intelligence (AI) applications.
NVIDIA says that its data center GPUs are ""deployed across all major hyperscale and cloud service providers globally and we see strengthening demand in the coming quarters."" That's not surprising, as the demand for data center GPUs could grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 42% through 2027, hitting $20.6 billion in revenue. NVIDIA is in a solid position to tap this opportunity, as it supplies its GPUs to the top cloud service providers and has been taking steps to diversify its revenue streams.
Meanwhile, NVIDIA's 80%-plus market share of gaming graphics cards will be another big tailwind for the company. Its video gaming revenue more than doubled last quarter to $2.76 billion. Jon Peddie Research estimates that the market for discrete gaming GPUs could jump from $23.6 billion last year to more than $54 billion by 2025. NVIDIA's dominant market share means that it could win big from the additional revenue opportunity.
Advanced Micro Devices: Widening its gap over Intel
AMD stock's retreat on the market isn't justified, as the chipmaker's impressive financial growth has continued this year after a strong 2020. AMD is on track to record 50% revenue growth in 2021, though it can do better as it was originally anticipating a 37% increase when the year began. The company's market share gains in the client and server CPU (central processing unit) markets, as well as the growing demand for graphics cards, have encouraged it to raise the guidance.
However, AMD can finish the year on a much stronger note, as it recorded 93% year-over-year revenue growth in Q1 to $3.4 billion, which was ahead of the market's expectations. The company is pulling the right strings to ensure that it sustains its high levels of growth, such as consistently winning market share from Intel.
Popular video game distribution platform Steam reports that AMD's share of the client CPU market has now exceeded 30%, a massive improvement from three years ago when it held just over 16% of the market. AMD's gains have been driven by a superior manufacturing process based on a 7-nanometer manufacturing node, while Intel's competing chips are expected to be out later this year.
But AMD seems all set to widen the gap over Chipzilla, as the former's foundry partner Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing is working on smaller 5nm and 6nm nodes. Such a move is likely to give AMD's Ryzen CPUs another performance boost and ensure that they continue to sell like hotcakes.
On the other hand, the massive increase in sales of gaming graphics cards, as discussed earlier, will also be a tailwind for AMD. That's because AMD plays second fiddle to NVIDIA in the GPU market, and the additional revenue opportunity over there could substantially add to its revenue in the long run. Throw in other catalysts such as the new console cycle that's giving AMD a significant lift, and it becomes easier to see why the company's fast growth is here to stay.
Intel: Trouble regaining its mojo
Unlike its rivals, Intel is in a rut. The chip giant has been unable to regain its mojo since losing its competitive edge. That was evident from Intel's Q1 results, as non-GAAP revenue of $18.6 billion was flat on a year-over-year basis. Gross margin shrank 6.1 percentage points year over year while operating margin fell 6.7 percentage points. As a result, Intel's net income was down 6% over the year-ago period.
Things are about to get worse for Intel in the second quarter. Revenue and adjusted earnings are expected to drop 10% and 15% year over year, respectively, while full-year non-GAAP revenue is anticipated to drop 7% to $72.5 billion. So, Intel's poor financial performance and outlook put it behind the likes of NVIDIA and AMD, which are delivering irresistible growth. As such, growth-oriented investors may drop Chipzilla from their watchlist of stocks to buy.
The verdict
With Intel out of the race, investors looking to buy a fast-growing semiconductor stock can choose either NVIDIA or AMD. From a valuation standpoint, AMD looks like the better buy as it trades at 36 times trailing earnings, compared to NVIDIA's multiple of nearly 90 times. AMD's price-to-sales ratio of nine is also much lower than NVIDIA's multiple of nearly 25 times.
Given that AMD's pace of growth was better than NVIDIA's in Q1 and is likely to keep up that momentum for the remainder of the year, it looks like a steal right now. AMD also looks like a better buy for those looking for a growth stock at a reasonable valuation. However, investors with a higher appetite for risk may also consider buying NVIDIA, as it can remain a top growth stock and justify its rich valuation by delivering terrific growth thanks to huge end-market opportunities.

Despite its stellar performance, AMC stock has moved sluggishly in the past few months in comparison to its peers.
The delay in the approval of its Xilinx deal in China and Europe seems to be holding its stock price back.
Hence AMC stock is trading at a fairly reasonable valuation and should break out once it overcomes its regulatory hurdles.

7 Stocks to Buy From the 'Goldman Sachs Renewable Energy Picks' List
AMD is coming off one of its strongest years in recent memory, with its year-over-year revenue growth at over 57%.
Moreover, its year-over-year EBITDA growth is at an incredible 118%. It enjoys a technical edge over its competitors, such as Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), who have been forced to play catch-up for most of the year.
AMD currently trades at roughly seven times forward sales, which is relatively expensive. However, given its business momentum, robust financials and technical superiority, its valuation is more than justified at this point.
Glittering Financials
AMD recently reported its first-quarter results, where its revenues rose to $3.5 billion, representing a 93% increase from the prior-year period. Consequently, GAAP net income rose shot up to $555 million, representing a 243% growth from year-ago levels.
In comparison, Intel generated $19.7 billion in its first quarter, a 1% decline from the same quarter last year.
More importantly, net income dropped 41% during the period, mainly due to a restructuring charge of $2.2 billion. Additionally, its revenues rose 8% last year compared with 2019.
The technical edge has mainly driven AMD’s success in CPUs. A few years ago, many had written off the company, but under the leadership of Lisa Su, its fortunes have changed completely.
A series of game-changing decisions have driven share gains against Intel in the CPU department.
Furthermore, AMD has made some great strides as far as free cash flows are concerned. It generated an incredible $832 million in the quarter compared to Intel’s $1.6 billion.
However, considering that Intel generates six times as much revenue as AMD, its performance is lackluster.
AMD/Xilinx Merger
AMD agreed to acquire semiconductor company Xilinx in a $35 billion all-stock transaction late last year. The aim was for both companies to complement each other’s product portfolios, create synergies, and expand AMD’s revenue base.
In addition, the acquisition will give AMD’s data center business a massive boost. Both companies have similar competencies in areas such as artificial intelligence and systems-on-a-chip.
The merger provides access to new markets in the industrial and automotive realms for AMD. Xilinx’s data center business will effectively complement AMD’s robust server capabilities and will enable it to leverage its EPYC technology.
However, the merger had run into regulatory roadblocks in Europe and China. The primary concern of these markets relates to anti-competitive behavior, with the company becoming remarkably powerful.
As it stands, the EU’s top antitrust regulator states it has no objections to the merger. The UK’s antitrust regulator is evaluating the merger proposal and will decide by next month.
However, the approval process in China will take significantly longer than in Europe. The average review period for such deals in the industry is more than 300 days.
Nonetheless, the merger’s approval in the EU and UK will be a major catalyst in itself and should push AMD stock’s price higher.
Bottom Line on AMD Stock
AMD is coming off one of its most successful years, but its stock price momentum has been sluggish overall.
AMD’s merger with Xilinx has stalled in Europe and China, which has slowed down the growth in its stock price. However, these roadblocks are likely to fade away soon, removing any impediments for AMD stock.
AMD stock is a definite buy at this stage, with an incredible outlook ahead and its stellar financial positioning.
