NEW YORK, April 22 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks dived on Thursday on reports President Joe Biden planned to almost double the capital gains tax, news analysts said provided an excuse to take profits in a directionless market ahead of big tech's earnings next week.
The three main indexes on Wall Street also fell on reports that Biden planned to raise income taxes on the wealthy, a proposal some said would be hard to pass in Congress.
""If it had a chance of passing, we'd be down 2,000 points,"" said Thomas Hayes, chairman and managing member at hedge fund Great Hill Capital LLC.
Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Investment Management in Chicago, said when a proposal is floated about raising taxes or capital gains, everybody gets excited, sells first and asks questions later.
""It is more of a short-term, knee-jerk reaction,"" he said.
Biden will propose raising the marginal income tax rate to 39.6% from 37% and nearly double capital gains taxes to 39.6% for people earning more than $1 million, sources told Reuters.
The proposal targets about $1 trillion for child care, universal pre-kindergarten education and paid leave for workers, the sources said.
Markets have been listless after the Dow .DJI and S&P 500 .SPX scaled all-time peaks last week as investors await guidance from Microsoft Corp MSFT.O, Google parent Alphabet Inc GOOGL.O and Facebook Inc FB.O when they report earnings next week.
""Until we get out of this information vacuum the market is going to be generally directionless,"" he said. ""All that really matters moving forward is what are those big tech earnings next week?""
Earlier in the session the S&P 500 healthcare sector .SPXHC hit a fresh record high while industrials .SPLRCI were the biggest gainers.
American Airlines Group Inc AAL.O and Southwest Airlines Co LUV.N reported smaller-than-expected quarterly losses, signaling a revival in travel demand. Both shares fell.
Investors welcomed data showing the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits last week dropped to a fresh one-year low. The Labor Department report suggested layoffs were subsiding and expectations were rising for another month of blockbuster job growth in April.
Separately, data showed U.S. home sales fell to a seven-month low in March, as an acute property shortage boosted prices and made owning a house more expensive for some first-time buyers.
The speedy U.S. vaccination rollout has improved the economic outlook as people plan summer vacations and spending on leisure activities, but a surge in COVID-19 cases in India and elsewhere in Asia has kept investors anxious, Hayes said.
Equities have likely reached a near-term top as expectations are too high, said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives at Charles Schwab.
""What moves markets most of the time is not the actual earnings results but the results versus expectations,"" he said. ""We've had pretty spectacular results overall.""
First-quarter earnings are expected to increase 31.9% from a year ago, the highest rate since the fourth-quarter of 2010, according to IBES Refinitiv data.
All 11 S&P 500 sectors closed lower as Microsoft, Apple Inc, Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O and Tesla Inc TSLA.O weighted the most on the downdraft.
Unofficially, the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 0.94%, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 0.92% and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 0.94%.
AT&T Inc T.N beat Wall Street revenue targets as the reopening of the U.S. economy following pandemic-linked restrictions boosted smartphone sales and the media business.
Chipmaker Intel Corp INTC.O is expected to post a drop in first-quarter revenue later in the day, with analysts looking forward to updates on its U.S. manufacturing plants and chips for automakers amid a global microchip supply shortage.
Biogen Inc BIIB.O beat estimates for quarterly profit on stronger-than-expected sales for its muscle wasting disorder drug, though concerns over its reliance on its yet-to-be approved Alzheimer's therapy, aducanumab, weighed on shares.

April 22 (Reuters) - The S&P 500 and Dow Jones indexes edged lower on Thursday as a resurgence of COVID-19 cases globally sapped appetite for stocks, with data showing tepid U.S. home sales adding to the grim mood.
Investor sentiment dulled in the first half hour of trading, with eight of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors in the red.

TAIPEI, April 22 (Reuters) - Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co's (TSMC) 2330.TW, TSM.N board has approved $2.89 billion in spending to increase capacity, the company said on Thursday, responding to a global chip shortage that has affected carmakers in particular.
In a brief statement, the world's largest contract chipmaker said its board had approved the spending ""for the purpose of installing mature technology capacity"".
It did not elaborate.
The company this month said that it plans to invest $100 billion over the next three years to increase capacity at its plants, days after Intel Corp INTC.O announced a $20 billion plan to expand its capacity.
TSMC, clients of which include Apple Inc AAPL.O and Qualcomm Inc QCOM.O, has said it is working hard to increase productivity and alleviate the worldwide shortage but that supply tightness is likely to continue into next year.
The company has flagged ""multiple years of growth opportunities"" as the COVID-19 pandemic fuels demand for advanced chips to power devices such as smartphones and laptops.
But its business has also been boosted by the chip shortage that initially forced automakers to cut production but is now also hurting manufacturers of smartphones, laptops and even household appliances.

In Malaysia, the company is harnessing sufficient solar energy to power six buildings across its Kulim and Penang campus. The addition of a 3.2-megawatt solar installation completed in January has allowed the chipmaker to achieve 4.1MW in total installed solar capacity.The Malaysia solar project contributes to about 15% of Intel's (INTC) total solar electric power capacity. The project is expected to help the company reduce its carbon emission by about 3,800 tons. Similarly, it affirms the company's commitment to operating manufacturing facilities with the lowest impact on the environment.Electricity from the solar panels is expected to compensate Intel Malaysia’s electricity demand during peak hours. Newly installed panels are poised to generate about 6,000 megawatt-hours of electricity each year.“The use of renewable power generated on site at Intel Malaysia is a critical part of Intel’s efforts as a responsible corporate citizen to do better by our planet and as part of our RISE 2030 goals of achieving 100% renewable power,” stated Robin Martin, Intel Malaysia, Corporate Vice President.Electricity from the solar panels should diversify Intel Malaysia’s energy supply while introducing renewable energy into the mix. Until now, the company has predominantly relied on electricity generated from natural gas and coal sources.Intel shares have jumped 26% year to date following a 16.7% slide in 2020.

April 22 (Reuters) - Wall Street's main indexes were set to open flat on Thursday as investors assessed earnings from U.S. airlines and AT&T, while data showed fewer Americans filed fresh claims for unemployment benefits last week.
Shares of American Airlines Group Inc AAL.O and Southwest Airlines Co LUV.N rose more than 2% each after the two airlines reported a smaller-than-expected quarterly loss.
Shares of AT&T Inc T.N jumped 4.5% after the company's wireless subscriber additions trounced analysts' estimates.
""The issue for investors in earnings season is whether you'll start to see continued growth in earnings projections or whether you'll start to get a flagging out as it seems like there is some inflation and disruption in the supply chain,"" said Rick Meckler, partner, Cherry Lane Investments, New Jersey.
""At these elevated levels you continue to need more good news to support higher stock prices.""
U.S. stock index futures briefly turned positive after initial claims for state unemployment benefits totaled 547,000 for the week ended April 17 compared to 586,000 in the prior week. The data suggested layoffs were subsiding and strengthened expectations for another month of blockbuster job growth in April.
Wall Street's main indexes closed higher on Wednesday, recovering from a two-day decline, with the economically sensitive value stocks .RLV gaining about 1.1%.
Speedy vaccination rollouts in the United States has improved the pace of economic recovery, infused confidence among people and given a solid start to the first-quarter earnings season.

2021-04-22 00:00:00+00:00,Silicon connectivity firm Alphawave targets $4.5 bln London listing,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/silicon-connectivity-firm-alphawave-targets-%244.5-bln-london-listing-2021-04-22,,,"By Paul Sandle and Muvija M
LONDON, April 22 (Reuters) - Alphawave, a Toronto-based silicon IP firm, is planning to list in London to expand the reach of its chip connectivity technology and could be valued at up to $4.5 billion based on cornerstone agreements with two major investors.
About $500 million would be raised by issuing new shares, it said, and existing investors would also offer stock.
Alphawave, founded in 2017 and profitable since 2018, said BlackRock BLK.N and Janus Henderson JHG.N had agreed to subscribe for $510 million of offer shares at a price that would give the firm an equity value of up to $4.5 billion at admission.
""We have chosen to come to the UK because of its incredible technology and semiconductor industry ecosystem,"" Chief Executive Tony Pialis said on Thursday.
""The strong research base in the UK - and our new R&D headquarters in Cambridge - offers an excellent foundation for the next stage of our global growth.""
Alphawave licenses its high-speed data transmission technology to chipmakers and receives a royalty on every chip produced, replicating a model pioneered by Cambridge-based ARM.
ARM was sold to Japan's Softbank <9984.T> in 2016 for $32 billion pounds, 18 years after it listed in London.
Last year, Softbank agreed to sell ARM to Nvidia <NVDA.O> in a $40 billion deal that is being scrutinised by Britain.
""A lot of people have called us the ARM of the connectivity business and that's a very fair analogy,"" Chairman John Lofton Holt said. ""We monetize in exactly the same way.""
CUTTING EDGE
Pialis said Alphawave's IP was being used at the cutting edge of chip design, at seven, six and five nanometers, and soon to be at four and three, with manufacturers like TSMC 2330.TW, Samsung 005930.KS and most recently Intel INTC.O.
Lofton Holt said the board had considered New York and Toronto before choosing London.
""Investors in the UK, Europe and even in the U.S. really understand that the UK has been the birthplace of silicon IP, so it's a natural place for us to list,"" he said.
It will join cybersecurity firm Darktrace in going public, and will follow Deliveroo ROO.L, whose IPO flopped last month.
Lofton Holt said unlike some other companies, Alphawave had been profitable since its first full year of operation.
The company's bookings, which reflect projected revenues, increased from $27 million in 2019 to $75 million in 2020 and exceeded $80 million in the first quarter of 2021.
One source close to the deal said investors were taking each IPO on its own merits.
""I don't think one IPO performing badly necessarily hurts the market,"" the source said, adding that solid cornerstone investors were helpful for issuers.
Barclays and J.P. Morgan will be joint co-ordinators and bookrunners, and BMO Capital Markets will be a joint bookrunner.

2021-04-22 00:00:00+00:00,Intel (INTC) 1st Quarter Earnings: What to Expect,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intel-intc-1st-quarter-earnings%3A-what-to-expect-2021-04-22,,,"I
ntel (INTC), the largest chip manufacturer by revenue, is set to report first quarter fiscal 2021 earnings results after the closing bell Thursday. Intel shares have rebound impressively, rising some 20% in six months and is now up more than 30% year to date, besting the 11% rise in the S&P 500 index.
The company’s stock performance suggests that the market is willing to look past the company’s self-inflicted wounds, which has caused it not only to lose ground and market share to rivals AMD (AMD) and Nvidia (NVDA) in several important chip developments, but also once-prominent customers such as Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT) are now designing chips to replace Intel’s offerings. This comes on the heels of Amazon (AMZN) two years ago opting to use its own ARM-based processors.
That’s part of the reason why, despite the recent rise in Intel’s share price, the stock remains at a bargain valuation and has not received multiple expansion, relative to other tech names such as Nvidia. However, New Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger has nonetheless done a solid job in his attempt to change the negative narrative surrounding the company. But not all of Wall Street is sold. Last week Raymond James downgraded Intel from Market Perform to Underperform, citing Intel’s over-dependency on PC demand.
In that vein, it’s worth noting that more than half of Intel’s consolidated revenues comes from computer demand. The firm is also skeptical on Intel's foundry ambitions, saying that even with the U.S. government's support, the project will burn a lot of cash. By contrast, analysts are CFRA have deemed the foundry opportunity “as massive.” The firm estimates the market to grow to $100 billion in the next four years. The company on Thursday must prove the naysayers wrong and its supporters right.
For the quarter that ended March, the Santa Clara, Calif.-based company is expected to earn $1.14 per share on revenue of $17.88 billion. This compares to the year-ago quarter when earnings were $1.45 per share on revenue of $19.83 billion. For the full year, ending in December, earnings are expected to decline 13% year over year to $4.58 per share, while full-year revenue of $75.36 billion would decline about 7% year over year.
The expected year-over-year declines in revenue and profits is one reason why Intel wants to re-invent itself. Aside from announcing several new initiatives, including IDM 2.0, Intel doubled down on its willingness to boost manufacturing capacity. But as noted, execution has been a major issue at Intel over the past several quarters. To be sure, Gelsinger, who does bring renewed optimism, was not CEO at the time. It still seems until Intel shows it can overcome its recent hurdles, the market will assume some execution risk. But the company atoned for some missteps in Q4.
In the fourth quarter, Intel came in with revenues of $19.98 billion which was down about 1% year over year, beating the 13% decline analysts were looking for. Fourth quarter adjusted EPS of $1.52 easily beat consensus by 41 cents. Data Center revenues were down 16% year over year, but still topped forecast. Notably, the PC Group grew revenue 9% year over year, besting the estimates for 2.5% decline.
All told, for the year, Intel grew revenues by more than 8%, which is impressive given the pandemic headwinds it had to overcome. With so much pessimism still priced in, Intel offers compelling long-term value, especially when combined with the 2.20% dividend yield.

2021-04-22 00:00:00+00:00,NVIDIA's Relationship With Healthcare Is Worth More Than You Think,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/nvidias-relationship-with-healthcare-is-worth-more-than-you-think-2021-04-22,,,"Let me start with a few keywords that should grab the attention of any potential investor: artificial intelligence (AI), deep learning, augmented reality, and accelerated computing. With technology advancements in these areas, computers are learning to write their own software, images are clearer, and the medical world is moving like the Millennium Falcon with Han Solo at the helm.
When we take a look at how these areas are shaping our world, there's one name that is consistently at or near the top: NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA). As a leader in innovative tech, from its GPUs that power gaming, enterprise graphics, and datacenters, to Jetson-like autonomous vehicles, the company has a hand in most things AI-related. But, did you know that NVIDIA's AI advancements also play an enormous part in the evolving healthcare industry?

The healthcare connection
During the annual GPU Technology Conference (GTC21) last week, NVIDIA shared over 200 presentations focused on healthcare, covering four primary areas: medical imaging, genomics, drug discovery, and smart hospitals. From kickoff to completion, NVIDIA leadership, along with its partners, drove home the importance of bringing AI and accelerated computing into surgery rooms, exam rooms, care centers, research labs, and reception areas. Advancements, such as NVIDIA Clara -- a framework application that provide tools to researchers and clinicians working in genomics, drug discovery, and medical device development -- are expanding, and bringing the medical world to the next level.
Moments in the sun
Fortunately, through the leadership of its Founder and CEO, Jensen Huang, NVIDIA has been successful in creating numerous pivotal moments to assist in revolutionizing technological advancement across the healthcare industry. Here are a few from the past five years:
2017: GE Healthcare is the first medical device company to use the NVIDIA GPU Cloud
2018: NVIDIA Clara platform introduced to bring AI to the next generation of medical instruments
2019: NVIDIA's Tensor Core GPUs are used for genome sequencing acceleration, allowing for rapid speeds and lowering costs
2020: NVIDIA debuts Clara Guardian to power smart hospitals; releases new AI models to help better detect infection; breaks genomics speed record in race to understand the SARS-CoV-2 virus
2021: ""We are seeing the smartphone moment for every industry"" – Jensen Huang, referring to thousands of companies across the world applying NVIDIA AI to create cloud-connected products with AI services that will transform the world's largest industries
A sign of good things
The global AI market in healthcare is estimated to grow between 40% and 50% per year on a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) through 2027 -- based on various reports -- for a market value just north of $60 billion. This leaves plenty of space for NVIDIA to collect outstanding revenues. And while sales are poised to explode, an analysis produced by Accenture finds that key clinical health AI applications could also create $150 billion in annual savings for the U.S. healthcare economy by 2026.
As the company continues to innovate, it will be helped along by the winds of change that take place within the healthcare space. As we've seen with response to the COVID-19 pandemic, it is increasingly important to diagnose serious ailments early, and to be able to model and predict results and outcomes. And as we continue to fight life-threatening diseases, more clinical trials will require applications that allow for deep learning at record speed with minimal human intervention.
In the next five to seven years, the healthcare industry is expected to grow rapidly in each of the four areas that were mentioned as primary segments for NVIDIA at this year's GTC21 event.
MARKET SEGMENT COMPOUND ANNUAL GROWTH RATE (CAGR) % THROUGH (YEAR)
Drug discovery 9.6 2025
Smart hospitals 21.1 2025
Medical imaging 5.2 2028
Genomics 15.4 2028

NVIDIA currently totes a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 88, which some may see as a bit high, considering competitors like AMD, Google, IBM, and Microsoft all fall in a range between 22 and 38, with Intel on the lower end at 13. By comparison, the average stock on the S&P 500 trades for 47 times earnings. But then again, NVIDIA's higher ratio also reflects that investors are expecting higher growth. In this case, I think it's for good reason.
Consistency is key
Solid revenue growth and a 16% gain year to date on the stock price is a lot to get excited about. In fact, even when the market experiences downturns as a whole, NVIDIA is still taking care of its investors, as exemplified by 34 straight quarters of dividend payouts dating back to 2012 -- and increasing every year since -- to a most recent annual payout of $0.64 per share.
And at no time did the dividend ever decrease during the course of a calendar year in that span. That is proof of consistency. One might conclude, after 10 quarters at $0.16, and following an excellent fourth quarterearnings call-- revenues jumped 61% year over year and beat estimates by 3.6% -- it may not take long to see that quarterly dividend go up a bit at some point before the year is over. That would be music to any investor's ears, and the sheer potential presented by the future of healthcare computing should justify NVIDIA as a company to consider for your portfolio.

2021-04-22 00:00:00+00:00,Forget the Sell-Off -- Wall Street Wants You to Buy AMD Stock,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/forget-the-sell-off-wall-street-wants-you-to-buy-amd-stock-2021-04-22,,,"Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) stock has headed south in 2021, as investors seem to be concerned about the stiff competition the chipmaker may face from rivals Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) and NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA). But Wall Street analysts believe that the sell-off isn't justified.
Analysts from Raymond James and Bank of America have an outperform rating on AMD stock with a price target of $100. Both firms have reminded investors that the chipmaker will continue to hold a competitive edge over Intel for the next few years. AMD has been eating into Intel's market share in 2021 thanks to its technological superiority, and the situation is unlikely to change anytime soon.
Here's why you should consider taking Wall Street's advice and go long on AMD stock.
Image source: Getty Images
AMD's advantage is here to stay
Raymond James predicts that AMD will hold an advantage over Intel in the CPU (central processing unit) market through 2024. Bank of America analysts also have a similar view, estimating that Intel may not be able to catch up to AMD for at least a couple of years until its 7-nanometer (nm) chips arrive.
BofA estimates that AMD could build an unassailable lead over Intel by then and take away more market share from Chipzilla. The firm expects Chipzilla to cede at least three percentage points of market share to AMD over the coming years.
On the other hand, Raymond James analyst Chris Caso cites the uncertainty surrounding Intel's plans for chip manufacturing and its ability to overcome the product development setbacks it has faced over the past few years. This is the reason why Caso is telling investors to buy AMD over Intel.
It is easy to understand why Wall Street is gunning for AMD to take away more market share from Intel. The company's latest Ryzen 5000 series processors have been selling like hotcakes even though they carry premium pricing. Additionally, AMD is on track to place its Ryzen 5000 processors inside 50% more notebooks and laptops this year, compared to the Ryzen 4000 chips that went into 100 laptop and notebook designs last year.
AMD has already taken a big chunk of the x86 processor market away from Intel over the past few years. The trend is likely to continue over the next few years as Intel plays catch-up, giving customers an incentive to buy AMD's processors because of their superior performance.
NVIDIA's data center entry shouldn't be a concern
NVIDIA's entry into the server processor market has spooked AMD investors. The chipmaker has launched the Grace CPU to attack the massive opportunity in the server processor market, where Intel is the dominant player right now and AMD is climbing up the charts.
But it may be too early to worry about NVIDIA's entry into this market, as the chipmaker specializes in graphics cards and not CPUs. AMD's server processors are now in their third generation after the launch of the EPYC 7003 series, so NVIDIA will have to catch up on this front. AMD claims that the new EPYC processors have been selected for use by top cloud service providers and server OEMs (original equipment manufacturers).
The chipmaker anticipates that the EPYC processors will power 400 cloud instances by the end of 2021. AMD had pointed out in its January earnings conference call that its cloud instances doubled in 2020 to just over 200, which means that the company anticipates another two-fold jump this year. Additionally, the chipmaker expects the new EPYC processors to be on 100 new server OEMs by the end of 2021.
According to data from Mercury Research, AMD had finished the fourth quarter of 2020 with a 7.1% server market share. Intel held the rest of the market, but it ceded 2.6 percentage points of market share to AMD during the year. It remains to be seen how NVIDIA's entry affects AMD's data center momentum this year, but the latter could keep gaining market share considering the partnerships it claims to have struck.
So, AMD stock could reverse course and start heading north as potential market share gains translate into a stronger financial performance. This is why Wall Street is bullish about AMD and anticipates substantial upside from this tech stock.

2021-04-22 00:00:00+00:00,"Forget Nokia, Qualcomm Is a Better 5G Stock",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/forget-nokia-qualcomm-is-a-better-5g-stock-2021-04-22,,,"At first glance, Nokia (NYSE: NOK) might seem like an attractive 5G investment. Its $4 share price is over 93% below its all-time high, and the company could engineer a comeback as a telecom equipment provider. However, such thinking could lead investors to miss the opportunity in Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM). Qualcomm stock has gained significant traction over the last year, and both market and financial factors indicate its 5G growth may have only just begun.
Image source: Getty Images.
Qualcomm's market position
Qualcomm owns the most extensive portfolio of wireless patents worldwide. Unlike Nokia, which must compete with the likes of Ericsson and Juniper Networks, these patents place Qualcomm in a dominant market position. Thanks to its influence in the chipset market, smartphone users cannot gain access to 5G without somehow going through Qualcomm.
Grand View Research forecasts a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 63% for smartphone chipsets. As market conditions stand now, all of that benefit accrues to Qualcomm.
The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) sued Qualcomm over this monopoly power, as did companies such as Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL). However, Qualcomm's attorneys persuaded an appeals court to overturn the previous ""monopoly"" ruling, and Apple eventually dropped its lawsuits against the wireless chip giant.
Nonetheless, Qualcomm will have to stay vigilant. After dropping its lawsuits, Apple bought Intel's (NASDAQ: INTC) smartphone chipset unit, presumably to reduce or eliminate its dependence on Qualcomm chipsets. Also, NVIDIA has attempted to purchase U.K.-based chip company Arm Holdings. Arm licenses designs of low-power chips to Qualcomm. Since this would probably compromise Qualcomm's market position, Qualcomm can't afford to let NVIDIA acquire Arm.
Qualcomm's financials
Still, these threats have so far done little to stop Qualcomm. For the first quarter of fiscal 2021, GAAP revenue increased 62% compared to the same period last year. Since operating expenses rose by only 14% during this time, net income surged by 165%. Revenue shot higher by only 35% during fiscal 2020 and by 73% from year-ago levels in the fourth quarter, showing a significant improvement in 5G revenue growth after Apple released its 5G iPhone last fall.
Qualcomm's growth also brought it $2.7 billion in free cash flow in the previous quarter alone. This left the company easily able to cover $141 million in interest payments. Moreover, its $15.7 billion in total debt, while significant, does not pose a threat to its balance sheet.
The cash flow also covered the quarterly dividend payout of $739 million, or $0.65 per share. That totals $2.60 annually, for a cash return of about 1.9%. While not high, this payout significantly exceeds the S&P 500 average dividend cash yield of about 1.4%.
The success has also helped Qualcomm stock gain just under 90% over the last 12 months. Thanks to this increase, it compares favorably to Nokia, which has risen by nearly 30% over the same period.
QCOM data by YCharts.
Despite this substantial rise, Qualcomm's P/E ratio comes in at about 23. This takes the earnings multiple close to the lows of last year, when the shares had fallen amid a massive drop in tech stocks. Additionally, prospective competitor NVIDIA sells for approximately 90 times earnings, making Qualcomm a more appealing alternative. Qualcomm even sports a lower multiple than Nokia, which sells for about 26 times its earnings.
Buying Qualcomm
Market dominance and a low multiple make Qualcomm one of the more lucrative 5G stocks. While Nokia sells for a low nominal price, its stock growth and market position do not compare well to Qualcomm.
Admittedly, if a peer can finally develop a competing chipset, it could cool growth in Qualcomm stock. Nonetheless, the 5G upgrade cycle looks poised to continue. Even if NVIDIA, Apple, or another company can gain some market share, the massive growth in the smartphone chipset market should keep Qualcomm moving higher.

A global shortage of semiconductors is having negative ramifications on many industries. Just this week Ford (NYSE:F) warned that they could miss out on $1 billion to $2.5 billion in sales because of the chip deficit. However, this situation has been a boon to the semiconductor industry and many chip stocks. Through the first three months of the year, the PHLX Semiconductor Sector Index (SOX) was up 11.8%, compared to the S&P 500’s 5.8% gain.

The demand for chips was already high due to the rollout of 5G. Still, demand skyrocketed as millions of people found themselves forced to stay at home due to the pandemic. Suddenly, sales of laptops and gaming consoles soared. And now that automobile manufacturers have reopened their plants, the demand for semiconductors has exploded with not enough chips to go around.
These shortages reflect a tight supply, but not a lack of demand, which means the chip rally should continue into summer. As the market has been retreating in recent days, it provides an opportunity to pick up chip stocks on the dip. That is why I am recommending two buy-rated semiconductors that should see their shares rise in the months ahead: Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO).
Top Chip Stocks: Intel Corporation (INTC) 
INTC is one of the world’s largest chipmakers. It designs and manufactures microprocessors for the global personal computer and data center markets. The company has been gradually reducing its dependence on its PC-centric business and moving into data-centric businesses like artificial intelligence (AI) and autonomous driving.

7 A-Rated Retirement Stocks to Buy
Its data businesses accounted for almost half of all revenue in 2020. As more devices become interconnected, this bodes well for INTC’s prospects. Data centers that facilitate information stored and analyzed mainly run with INTC server chips. But we can’t count out its PC business yet. INTC holds a dominant market share for microprocessors in the consumer and enterprise markets.
The company has an overall grade of B, which translates into a buy rating in our POWR Ratings system. The POWR Ratings analyzes 118 different factors for every stock. These factors also contribute to 6 component grades. For instance, INTC has a Value Grade of A, which isn’t surprising as its stock looks undervalued based on multiple valuation ratios, including a forward P/E of only 14.22.
INTC also has a Quality Grade of A based on the strength of its balance sheet. As of its most recent quarter, the company had a whopping $24 billion in cash compared with only $2.5 billion in short-term obligations. We also grade INTC based on Growth, Momentum, Stability, and Sentiment. You can find those grades here. INTC is ranked No. 8 in the B-rated Semiconductor & Wireless Chip industry.

Broadcom Inc. (AVGO)
AVGO is a top designer, developer, and global supplier of an extensive range of semiconductor devices. The company formed after the merger of Avago and Broadcom Corporation in 2016. Avago was focused on radio frequency filters and amplifiers used in high-end smartphones and legacy Broadcom targeted networking semiconductors and connectivity chips.
With a gross margin of 57.5%, AVGO is one of the most profitable semiconductor companies, which should continue to drive strong cash flow. The company remains well-positioned to benefit from strength in its semiconductor and infrastructure software offerings that address the needs of growing technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and 5G.
For instance, AVGO should benefit from content gains as more consumers upgrade to 5G devices. Plus, the company will take advantage of its networking chip expertise to grow revenue significantly in the years ahead. The stock has an overall grade of A, which is also a Strong Buy rating in our POWR Ratings system.

April 21 (Reuters) - A U.S. jury on Wednesday ruled in favor of Intel Corp INTC.O in a patent infringement lawsuit filed against it by VLSI Technology LLC.
VLSI, a unit of the hedge fund Fortress Investment Group, had sued Intel in April 2019, alleging that products using ""Speed Shift"" technology infringed patents it had been assigned.
The verdict was issued by a federal jury in Waco, Texas.
It came after a different Waco jury on March 2 ordered Intel to pay VLSI $2.18 billion for infringing two other patents once owned by Dutch chipmaker NXP Semiconductors NV NXPI.O.
Intel is seeking a new trial in that case, and has said it intended to appeal the $2.18 billion verdict.

MicroVision (NASDAQ:MVIS) is climbing dramatically in trading Wednesday, boosted by Reddit chatter around the company as well as renewed investor interest in LiDAR technology more broadly. MVIS stock is up more than 20% on significantly higher trading volume today and currently has a short float of 31%.
Source: temp-64GTX/Shutterstock.com
MicroVision was the most mentioned stock ticker on r/WallStreetBets over the past 48 hours, according to Unbiastock. That means MVIS beat out Reddit darling Gamestop (NYSE:GME) as well as Clover Health (NASDAQ:CLOV), which has been targeted by retail investors looking for the next big short squeeze due to its 34% short float.
MicroVision also likely has competitor Luminar Technologies (NASDAQ:LAZR) to thank for some of the day’s gains, following an announcement by LAZR that executives from Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) would be joining the company. While those executives are coming on board to handle investor relations and legal counsel, nabbing executives from two household-name tech titans was sure to renew interest in LiDAR technologies.
In particular, the vote of confidence from an ex-Tesla employee looks good given CEO Elon Musk’s repeated denouncement of LiDAR. Musk has gone so far as to say he wouldn’t use LiDAR sensors in Tesla vehicles even if they were free.

7 A-Rated Retirement Stocks to Buy
However, investors shouldn’t get caught up in the excitement yet. Consider this cautionary tale from someone who bought MVIS near its February peak and is currently sitting on a 49% loss. And remember, LiDAR stocks had a tough go of things in March. Part of their relative strength now is really about their previous weakness.
Even if you disagree with Elon and believe LiDAR will be the future of autonomous vehicles, there’s no guarantee MicroVision will be the company, or even a company, that survives and takes significant market share. This company was labeled a “corporate husk” by Hindenburg Research just a few months ago, yet the share price has only grown since then.
The Bottom Line On MVIS Stock
“Today, even though MVIS is a 28-year old company boasting a portfolio of over 500 patents, it hasn’t converted any of this IP into licensing revenue. Nor has it been able to land a direct purchase from a technology or industrial company.”
That’s InvestorPlace Market Analyst Joanna Makris, pointing out that MicroVision is a long-running company with a checkered past and little in the way of deliverables.
The fact the company doesn’t have a product in-hand also bothered InvestorPlace analyst Mark R. Hake, CFA, who said it all in the headline: “MicroVision Stock Has Limited Upside Until it Has a Product in Hand.” Hake also emphasized a comment from the March 11earnings callwhere CEO Sumit Sharma indicated the company was up for sale. A potential buyer would likely want to see MVIS stock deflate to a more reasonable valuation before buying.
InvestorPlace’s Chris Markoch wrote on April 12 that “Investors are getting ahead of themselves with MVIS stock,” but it’s not all doom and gloom. Colleague Chris Tyler pointed out on April 15 that the price chart looked promising for continuing the rally in MicroVision. And just yesterday, InvestorPlace analyst Louis Navellier said MicroVision looked perfectly priced at $10 and change.

2021-04-21 00:00:00+00:00,NVIDIA Hits Intel Where It Hurts With a New Data Center CPU,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/nvidia-hits-intel-where-it-hurts-with-a-new-data-center-cpu-2021-04-21,,,"NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) just unveiled Grace, its first high-end CPU for data centers. The chip, named after the computer science pioneer Grace Hopper, is an Arm-based chip that will be used to handle demanding AI and high-performance computing (HPC) tasks.
NVIDIA claims Grace can deliver up to 30 times higher aggregate bandwidth than today's fastest servers, and up to 10 times higher performance for applications that process terabytes of data. It says the design will ""enable scientists and researchers to train the world's largest models to solve the most complex problems.""
NVIDIA's jump from data center GPUs to CPUs isn't surprising, but it could raise red flags at Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), which still controls nearly 97% of the server CPU market, according to PassMark Software. Let's see why NVIDIA is expanding into Intel's strongest market.
Image source: NVIDIA.
What's NVIDIA's game plan?
NVIDIA is often associated with gaming GPUs, but data centers also use its high-end GPUs to process AI and machine learning tasks.
A CPU processes pieces of data individually, while GPUs process a large array of integers and floating-point numbers simultaneously. Together, CPUs and GPUs process AI tasks much faster than stand-alone CPUs or GPUs.
NVIDIA's DGX Station A100, which it calls an ""AI data center in a box,"" pairs its GPUs with AMD's (NASDAQ: AMD) Epyc x86 server CPUs. Newer versions of that box could pair NVIDIA's Grace CPUs with its own GPUs instead to showcase the combined processing power of its chips.
In addition to selling new data center GPUs, NVIDIA also acquired the data center network equipment maker Mellanox last April. As a result, its total data center revenue surged 124% to $6.7 billion in fiscal 2021 and accounted for 40% of its top line.
But that's not all -- NVIDIA is also trying to buy Arm from SoftBank (OTC: SFTB.Y) to fully close the loop.
If NVIDIA buys Arm, it will control the chip architecture that powers most of the world's smartphones. Arm doesn't sell any chips, but it collects licensing fees and royalties from Arm-based chipmakers like Qualcomm and Apple.
NVIDIA pays licensing fees to Arm for its lower-end Tegra CPUs and its new Grace CPUs, but a takeover would eliminate those costs. Arm is still hardly used in data center chips compared to the x86 architecture used by Intel and AMD, but NVIDIA's Grace could finally disrupt that monopoly.
Intel claims to be playing offense
Intel's data center revenue rose 11% to $26.1 billion, or 34% of its top line, last year. However, the segment's sales declined year over year in the third and fourth quarters amid pandemic-related headwinds and tougher competition from AMD's Epyc CPUs.
Image source: Getty Images.
Intel also continued to struggle with an ongoing chip shortage as its internal foundry fell behind Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) in the ""process race"" to manufacture smaller chips. AMD, which outsourced its chip production to TSMC instead of manufacturing them internally, pulled ahead of Intel with more advanced chips.
Intel's new CEO, Pat Gelsinger, who took over in February, is trying to resolve its R&D and production issues. However, he recently warned that it could still take a ""couple of years"" to address its current shortages.
Analysts expect these challenges to cause Intel's revenue and earnings to decline 7% and 14%, respectively, this year. They expect NVIDIA's revenue to rise 34% this year with 35% earnings growth.
Gelsinger recently told Fortune that NVIDIA was merely ""responding"" to Intel's integration of new AI features in its newest CPUs, and that it remained ""on the offense, not the defense"" in the AI market. Intel also recently launched its first discrete GPUs for data centers to challenge NVIDIA.
That's a bold claim, but NVIDIA's surging data center GPU sales and the potential synergies between Mellanox, Arm, and its Grace CPUs could all spell trouble for Intel. Competitive pressure from AMD in both PCs and data centers could exacerbate the pain.
The bottom line
It's unclear if NVIDIA's Grace CPUs will gain any ground against Intel's industry-standard Xeons in the data center market. However, it represents a bold step in the right direction and sparks fresh hope for Arm-based CPUs to make progress in the data center market again.
Intel claims to be playing offense, but it seems like it's destined to play defense against NVIDIA's ambitious efforts for the foreseeable future.

2021-04-21 00:00:00+00:00,Intel Corporation's (NASDAQ:INTC) Stock Has Fared Decently: Is the Market Following Strong Financials?,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intel-corporations-nasdaq%3Aintc-stock-has-fared-decently%3A-is-the-market-following-strong,,,"Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) stock is up by 6.9% over the past three months. Given that the market rewards strong financials in the long-term, we wonder if that is the case in this instance. In this article, we decided to focus on Intel's ROE.
ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments.
How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?
The formula for return on equity is:
Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity
So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Intel is:
26% = US$21b ÷ US$81b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2020).
The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.26.
Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?
Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.
Intel's Earnings Growth And 26% ROE
First thing first, we like that Intel has an impressive ROE. Additionally, the company's ROE is higher compared to the industry average of 12% which is quite remarkable. This likely paved the way for the modest 19% net income growth seen by Intel over the past five years. growth
Next, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Intel's growth is quite high when compared to the industry average growth of 14% in the same period, which is great to see.
NasdaqGS:INTC Past Earnings Growth April 21st 2021
Earnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. One good indicator of expected earnings growth is the P/E ratio which determines the price the market is willing to pay for a stock based on its earnings prospects. So, you may want to check if Intel is trading on a high P/E or a low P/E, relative to its industry.
Is Intel Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?
Intel has a healthy combination of a moderate three-year median payout ratio of 27% (or a retention ratio of 73%) and a respectable amount of growth in earnings as we saw above, meaning that the company has been making efficient use of its profits.
Moreover, Intel is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of paying a dividend for at least ten years. Based on the latest analysts' estimates, we found that the company's future payout ratio over the next three years is expected to hold steady at 30%. Regardless, Intel's ROE is speculated to decline to 20% despite there being no anticipated change in its payout ratio.
Summary
Overall, we are quite pleased with Intel's performance. Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business, and at a high rate of return. Unsurprisingly, this has led to an impressive earnings growth. Having said that, on studying current analyst estimates, we were concerned to see that while the company has grown its earnings in the past, analysts expect its earnings to shrink in the future.

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.

2021-04-20 00:00:00+00:00,ASML Can't Stay Neutral on China for Much Longer,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/asml-cant-stay-neutral-on-china-for-much-longer-2021-04-20,,,"ASML (NASDAQ: ASML) is one of the world's most important semiconductor equipment makers. The Dutch company holds a near-monopoly in lithography machines, which are used to etch circuit patterns onto silicon wafers.
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM), the world's most advanced contract chipmaker, can't produce its newest chips without ASML's EUV (extreme ultraviolet) lithography machines. Samsung, Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), and other foundries also use ASML's machines, making it a crucial cog in the semiconductor sector, which is struggling with ongoing chip shortages.
ASML's dominance of the lithography market makes it an attractive investment, but it's getting squeezed in the escalating tech war between the U.S. and China. Let's see how ASML is trying to stay neutral in this conflict, and why it probably can't maintain that stance for much longer.

ASML, TSMC, and SMIC
ASML's largest customer is TSMC, which is based in Taiwan and produces the world's smallest and most powerful chips for fabless clients like AMD, Apple, and Qualcomm.
TSMC's orders accounted for 31% of ASML's revenue in 2020, and it plans to boost its capex this year to keep pace with the surging global demand for new chips. A lot of that spending should flow to ASML.
The U.S. considers TSMC a major ally in its tech war against China. If it prevents TSMC from manufacturing its smallest (5nm to 7nm) chips for China's fabless chipmakers, U.S. chipmakers could remain ahead in the ""process race"" to create more advanced chips.
That's why the U.S. barred TSMC from manufacturing chips for Huawei last year, invited the company to open new plants in the U.S., and passed sanctions against SMIC (OTC: SMIC.Y), China's largest contract chipmaker.
SMIC remains roughly two chip generations behind TSMC, but China's government is aggressively investing in its growth to close that gap and reduce its dependence on foreign chipmakers. However, SMIC still needs ASML's newest lithography machines to accomplish that goal.
Trying to stay neutral on China
ASML's revenue from China rose 69% to 2.32 billion euros ($2.76 billion), or 17% of its top line, in 2020. Its revenue from Taiwan declined 12% to 4.73 billion euros ($5.66 billion), or 34% of its top line.

ASML sold more lithography machines to Chinese chipmakers like SMIC during the year, but those sales only included older machines instead of the latest EUV machines that are used to produce 5nm and 7nm chips.
ASML recently extended its current deal with SMIC, which initially spanned from 2018 to 2020, to the end of 2021. It's unclear if ASML will extend that deal again, but SMIC recently claimed it can now produce 7nm chips without using ASML's EUV machines.
ASML still wants to sell its highest-end EUV machines to Chinese chipmakers, but the Dutch government hasn't approved those exports yet. U.S. and European regulators are also reportedly trying to block those shipments. ASML CEO Peter Wennink has been critical of the export controls and suggested they are misguided efforts to reduce risks. He told Bloomberg they hurt employment and income opportunities for non-Chinese economies caught in the middle.
Wennink claims U.S. chip businesses could lose $80 billion to $100 billion in sales and 125,000 jobs by cutting off Chinese companies. He also warned that Chinese companies like SMIC would eventually catch up with their own domestic chipmaking technologies.
ASML will need to pick a side
The tech war between the U.S. and China could continue for the foreseeable future, so ASML's attempts to stay neutral will likely fail.
China expects to be cut off from ASML's newest EUV machines and TSMC's most advanced plants, so it will continue to invest in its state-backed chipmakers. The U.S. will likely respond to those increased investments with even more blacklists and tighter sanctions against Chinese chipmakers.
That cycle will exacerbate the tech war, throttle the growth of ASML's Chinese business, and increase its dependence on Taiwan, South Korea, and other big chipmaking markets. ASML's business can easily survive that shift, but it should pick a side as the U.S. and China decouple their technologies and draw battle lines across the global semiconductor market.

April 20 (Reuters) - At an event Tuesday, Apple Inc AAPL.O may sharpen its focus on rival Spotify with a new podcast subscription service and finally may show off tiny tags meant to locate lost items.
The event, being broadcast from Apple's Cupertino, California headquarters, is also likely to include an update to Apple's iPad Pro tablet and its iMacs.
Apple shares have risen nearly 95% over the past year, faster than the 63% rise in the Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC, thanks to a record $274.5 billion in sales for fiscal 2020 as consumers stocked up on electronics during the pandemic. Apple shares were down 1% ahead of the event.
Macs and iPads accounted for $52.3 billion during its fiscal 2020, and analysts expect updates to the top-end iPad Pro models on Tuesday, including better display and processing technology.
“The Pro iPads are not the volume sellers, but they blur the line between Mac and iPad. How Apple differentiates between the iPad Pro and the Mac will be very interesting to watch,"" Ben Bajarin, principal analyst for consumer market intelligence at Creative Strategies.
Analysts also expect Apple to take aim at podcasts, which have become a focus for its streaming music rival Spotify Technology SA SPOT.N, with a subscription service.
Apple may also release tracking devices called AirTags that would use the same technology that helps Apple customers locate lost phones and ear buds to locate lost wallets or keys.
The release could result in a new round of complaints to lawmakers that Apple is hurting smaller rivals. Tile, a startup that has sold a competing tracker for nearly a decade, last year testified before the U.S. House of Representatives that Apple's App Store rules had made it harder to use Tile's products and will be called before the U.S. Senate to testify on Wednesday.
Apple has said it subjects all apps, including its own, to the same App Store review rules.
Bob O'Donnell, head of TECHnalysis Research, said he does not believe the trackers will become a big business on their own. ""Because they are so late to this, it might not be that much different than when Apple got into set top boxes like Apple TV. They’re a player. They’re there, but they're not huge,"" he said.
But Bajarin said the trackers could keep people tied to their iPhones if they rely on them to find items like keys and wallets.
""The more you buy into just one hardware product, the less likely it is you’ll ever leave,"" Bajarin said.
O'Donnell said other announcements could include Apple moving some of its iMac models to its own processors from Intel Corp's INTC.O chips; and a consumer computer monitor in a lineup that recently has only had a high-priced screen for video professionals.

2021-04-20 00:00:00+00:00,Intel Earnings Preview: Here’s What To Watch For,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intel-earnings-preview%3A-heres-what-to-watch-for-2021-04-20,,,"Intel Corporation (INTC) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2021 earnings on April 22 after the market closes. Over the past six months, shares of the tech giant have jumped 19% and are currently trading at over $63. A strong print could send shares on an upward trajectory, so let’s take a closer look at what analysts on the Street are expecting.
Earnings Preview
Intel is expected to report adjusted EPS of $1.15 on revenues of $17.88 billion, while the company guided for earnings of $1.10 per share and adjusted revenues of $17.5 billion.
Meanwhile, the Earnings Whisper number, or the Street’s unofficial view on earnings, stands at $1.30 per share.
Prior Period Results
In the previous quarter, the company reported adjusted earnings of $1.52, in line with the prior-year quarter. That said, the result topped the consensus estimate of $1.10. In addition, revenue declined 1% to $20 billion, but surpassed analysts’ expectations of $17.5 billion. (See Intel stock analysis on TipRanks)
Factors To Look For
Intel works through various units, and of these, Client Computing Group (CCG), Data Center Group (DCG), Non-volatile Memory Solutions Group (NSG), and Mobileye were the top performers in 2020.
Notably, there was a spike in demand for enterprise laptops and data center servers as a result of the pandemic. Therefore, sales of processors might have supported the company’s revenues in the to-be-reported quarter.
Furthermore, Intel’s CCG segment revenues could have potentially risen due to encouraging demand for PCs. Additionally, higher demand for Wi-Fi and modem along with notebook demand should aid CCG revenues. The Mobileye segment most likely contributed to revenues thanks to the stabilizing automotive industry and its new offerings.
Though IOTG revenue was down in the prior quarter due to the impact of COVID-19, the company expects a recovery in 2021 on stabilizing industrial and video segments.
Intel’s innovative technologies are experiencing strong demand, the impact of which is likely to be recorded in the first quarter results. Notably, the company’s 11th Gen Intel Core Tiger Lake Processors, recent Core vPro and Lakefield processors could be revenue drivers.
Likewise, the 10-nanometer-based Xeon Scalable CPU Ice Lake has significant value across cloud, network, and edge workloads.
Furthermore, the company’s lead in key technology inflections including AI, 5G network transformation, and the intelligent autonomous edge might have accelerated growth. Moreover, the company’s network silicon product in wireless, enterprise, and cloud networks gives it a competitive edge and is likely to have bolstered revenues in the quarter.
However, the DCG segment might have disappointed due to continued weak enterprise and government demand for data center due to the pandemic.
Recent Developments
Earlier this month, the most advanced, highest performance data center platform has been launched by Intel. New 3rd Gen Intel Xeon Scalable processors will enable customers to capitalize on some of the most significant business opportunities by leveraging the power of AI, the company said.
Last month, the company announced the expansion of its semiconductor manufacturing capacity, with the initiation of two new factories (fabs) at the Ocotillo campus in Chandler, representing an investment of $20 billion.
Furthermore, the evolution of Intel’s integrated device manufacturing (IDM) model strategy, called IDM 2.0, was also announced. The fabs are expected to cater to the increasing requirements of Intel’s current products and customers in addition to providing committed capacity to foundry customers.
Updating the outlook for 2021 in late March, Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger said, “2021 is a transitional year as we accelerate Intel’s trajectory, invest in our future and improve our execution. We’re working aggressively with our supply chain partners and leveraging our unique manufacturing capabilities to solve for industry-wide component shortages and outperform this guide. Given the incredible demand for computing, the strength of our IDM 2.0 strategy and the technology investments we’re making, I’m certain Intel’s best days are in front of us.”
Notably, Intel expects continued strong notebook demand to aid its first-quarter 2021 results and exceed previous guidance.
Overall, investors might expect a ray of light when it comes to the issue of chip shortages, which have impacted semiconductor clients worldwide.
Analyst Recommendations
On April 19, Northland Securities analyst Gus Richard reiterated a Sell rating and a price target of $48 on the stock.
Richard expects “INTC to report in line with our estimates and above consensus.”
The analyst added, “Intel can sell every CPU they can produce as China Inc. builds a strategic inventory reserve of $100B to $150B of which we estimate $50B of that is in place by the end of Q1. Still, we expect Intel’s revenue in Q1 will likely underperform the PC market and semiconductor market.”
Overall, the stock has a Hold consensus rating based on 12 Buys, 10 Holds, and 8 Sells. The average analyst price target of $67.68 implies 6.6% upside potential from current levels.

Investing in tech stocks may have been the simple yet effective strategy to beat the stock market in the past. But can we say the same about the stock market today? Possibly. As we enter a new earnings season and tech indices are at all-time highs, investors are watching these reports closely to see if they are good enough to justify the rallies. To date, the market sentiment appears to be strong as bank stocks kicked off the season with a string of strong earnings last week. Coupled with the strong economic data and stimulus hopes, can we expect top tech stocks to rebound greatly when they report earnings this season?
In the past year, the NASDAQ-100 has risen by over 50% gains. That suggests that interest in tech stocks has been high among investors. On top of that, new innovations have continued to demonstrate the relevance of tech. Most industries today would not be able to sustain their growth without tech. Take retail, for example, imagine having shopping centers that only accept cash and no other payment method. Undoubtedly, this would affect business in the long run as many people are going cashless. 
Some of the top gainers for the past year have been tech-driven companies. For instance, Zoom Video Communications Inc (NASDAQ: ZM) is one of the fastest-growing tech stocks out there. Revenue for the video-conferencing company came in 326% higher in 2020. Electric vehicle stocks like Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) also posted impressive financial figures. Its revenue came in 28% higher for the fiscal year 2020 to reach $31.5 billion. This goes without saying, both company’s shares have seen significant gains over the past year. So, with the following big names in the tech industry reporting this week, do you have them on your watchlist?
