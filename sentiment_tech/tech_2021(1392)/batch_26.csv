In recent months, the U.S. chipmaker has been seeking 8 billion euros ($9.5 billion) in public subsidies to build a semiconductor manufacturing site in Europe.
""I strongly support this,"" said Economy Minister Hubert Aiwanger, whose state is home to luxury carmaker BMW BMWG.DE. ""The possible location of a large international semiconductor manufacturer in Bavaria is an outstanding opportunity.""
Bavaria has suggested a disused air base in Penzing-Landsberg, west of Munich as a possible location for the factory, Aiwanger said.
A shortage of semiconductors is causing headwinds for Europe's car manufacturers and threatens to de-rail Germany's economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic.
The European Union is considering creating a semiconductor alliance including STMicroelectronics, NXP, Infineon and ASML to cut dependence on foreign chipmakers during a global supply chain crunch.

2021-06-17 00:00:00+00:00,1 Growth Stock That Could Be Bigger Than Apple,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/1-growth-stock-that-could-be-bigger-than-apple-2021-06-17,,,"In 1999, NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) invented the graphics processing unit (GPU), a chip that revolutionized the gaming industry. Then in 2006, it introduced the CUDA programming model, turning GPUs into general-purpose processors. Together, these innovations transformed NVIDIA into a supercomputing company, powering its rise in the data center market.
NVIDIA hasn't lost that innovative spark, and its pipeline is full of products that could be growth drivers over the coming decade. In fact, if the company executes on its massive market opportunity, I think NVIDIA could be bigger than Apple by 2031. Here are three reasons why.
Image source: Getty Images
1. The data center
Currently, NVIDIA controls over 90% of the data center accelerator market. Over the past 12 months, its data center business generated $7.6 billion in revenue, up 117%. But management sees a much larger market opportunity -- which could generate $100 billion by 2024.
To that end, NVIDIA recently launched the DGX SuperPOD, a turnkey solution for enterprise artificial intelligence (AI). This cloud-native supercomputer simplifies AI, delivering in one platform all of the resources (i.e., hardware and software) clients need to build and deploy AI applications.
Likewise, the Bluefield-3 data processing unit (DPU) is a new chip designed to accelerate and secure data center infrastructure. Specifically, DPUs off-load services like networking, storage, and security, boosting the performance of central processing units (CPU).
Finally, NVIDIA recently announced the Grace CPU. Set to launch in 2023, this ARM-based processor will accelerate AI workloads by a factor of 10. Moreover, alongside the DPU and GPU, it will make NVIDIA a three-chip company. CEO Jensen Huang believes this vertical integration will be a significant advantage, allowing NVIDIA to ""re-architect the data center to advance AI.""
2. Autonomous vehicles
The NVIDIA DRIVE platform is designed to power autonomous vehicles (AVs). It combines in-car hardware with AI software, allowing vehicles to see, think, and move safely through their environments. In a recent report from advisory firm Navigant Research, NVIDIA DRIVE ranked as the No. 1 AV compute platform on the market.
The brains behind this system is NVIDIA Orin, a supercomputer that delivers 254 TOPS of performance, meaning it can perform 254 trillion operations per second. By comparison, the latest chip from Intel's Mobileye -- the No. 2 player in Navigant's report -- delivers just 24 TOPS.

While NVIDIA Orin won't ship until 2022, automakers like NIO and Volvo have already selected NVIDIA DRIVE to power their autonomous fleets. As a result, NVIDIA is set to recognize $8 billion in automotive revenue over the next six years. But that small figure doesn't scratch the surface of its long-term potential.
Management believes the AV platform market will reach $25 billion by 2025. Given its competitive edge, NVIDIA could capture the lion's share of that figure. And if that happens, automotive sales could become a third major revenue stream for NVIDIA, supplementing its gaming and data center businesses.
3. NVIDIA Omniverse
This summer, NVIDIA will launch Omniverse, a platform that allows clients to build 3D simulations in real time. It connects industry-leading design tools from partners like Autodesk and Adobe, enabling collaboration in a shared virtual space. This is a big deal for three reasons.
First, Omniverse will accelerate AI. NVIDIA DRIVE Sim is an Omniverse-powered application that allows clients to generate synthetic driving data. That data can then be used in the real world to train AI models for autonomous vehicles.
Second, Omniverse is a subscription product. That's noteworthy because semiconductor sales tend to be cyclical, which can cause lumpy revenue growth. But subscription sales are typically recurring in nature, meaning Omniverse could help NVIDIA grow its top line more consistently.
Third, NVIDIA believes this is a stepping-stone to the Metaverse. If you're unfamiliar with the term, the idea comes from science fiction. The Metaverse refers to a persistent virtual world, a digital reality where people can interact and share experiences.
Here's the big picture: The virtual reality market will hit $69 billion by 2028, according to Grand View Research. And so far, NVIDIA Omniverse is gaining traction rapidly. During the three-month beta testing period, it was downloaded by over 17,000 users.
A final word
To summarize, NVIDIA benefits from a solid competitive position and a massive market opportunity. Both advantages should be growth drivers over the coming decade. But will they be enough to eclipse Apple's current market cap of $2.1 trillion?
No one knows the future, but I think it's possible. Since fiscal 2016 (ended Jan. 31, 2016), NVIDIA's revenue has grown at 29% per year. If it can maintain an annual growth rate of just 17% over the next decade (assuming its price-to-sales ratio remains unchanged), NVIDIA's market cap would reach $2.2 trillion in 2031.

2021-06-17 00:00:00+00:00,3 Semiconductor Stocks to Trade Right Now,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-semiconductor-stocks-to-trade-right-now-2021-06-17,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Semiconductor shortage!! We’ve all heard about it. But when it comes to three of today’s largest and most influential semiconductor stocks, there’s no shortage of diversified trade ideas taking shape on the price chart, along with well-placed option strategies, to make bulls, bears and momentum-driven Redditors happy. Let me explain.
It’s headline news in 2021. And there’s good reason. Semiconductors may not be in the air we breathe, but they’re everywhere else in today’s digital world. From our treasured Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhones to the Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) in your driveway, semiconductors are critical to our latest consumer technologies. But it doesn’t stop there.
Semiconductors are key to the factories which build those products, the grid systems that power them and our wired smart homes whose doors would otherwise remain locked. Semiconductors are even in June and Ward Cleaver products such as toothbrushes and toasters. They are everywhere.
In short, we’re heavily reliant on semiconductors of all kinds, to make what’s taken for granted, possible.

Today, it’s also no secret supply chain issues tied to the pandemic, as well as global trade sanctions have put a bit of monkey wrench, semiconductor-powered of course, into the availability and cost of, quite simply, living as we know it.
Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD)
Intel (NASDAQ:INTC)
Nvidia (NYSE:NVDA)
When it comes to the stock market though, the semiconductor story is playing out a bit differently on our price charts. And quite arguably, the big picture for three of the market’s largest semiconductor stocks shows there’s no shortage of ideas to keep bulls, bears and even today’s popularized momentum crowd profitably satisfied.
Semiconductor Stocks: Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)

Source: Charts by TradingView
The first of our semiconductor stocks to trade are shares of Advanced Micro Devices. And today, following an ominous encounter with a bearish head-and-shoulders topping pattern on the monthly price chart, AMD stock is a buy.
By the numbers, AMD’s bearish tryst has set the stock back by about 12% in 2021. The performance also pales on both a relative and absolute basis to the VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SMH) which has added nearly 16% this year. It sounds and even looked really bad for this semiconductor stock not too long ago. But not anymore.
Technically and instead of a gloomy June furthering the bear’s wrath on the AMD stock chart, the month has established a promising bullish pattern-busting spot to go long.
Specifically, a failure in May to break neckline support instead formed a bullish monthly hammer candle. And today the price action has improved with a stochastics crossover in oversold territory and bullish candlestick confirmation.
Pattern failures can be extremely powerful opportunities. The expectation is for a full-blown right shoulder failure in the coming weeks. And from there, new all-time-highs later this year would be easily attainable. Given the bullish assessment and size of the head-and-shoulders, the December $90/$105 bull call spread is one favored way to better protect and serve investors’ trading accounts.
Intel (INTC)

Source: Charts by TradingView
Intel is the next of our semiconductor stocks to trade. Unlike AMD stock though, Intel’s index-trending 16% year-to-date gain appears in jeopardy of failing on an absolute and relative basis.
Technically, the observation is this chip stock’s double top pattern hasn’t finished with its bearish business. As much, INTC stock also looks like a bearish short.
To be fair and quite similar to Advance Micro, shares have formed a near identical two candlestick bottoming configuration. Unlike AMD though, which failed to break its neckline, I’m keen on respecting INTC’s bearish May pattern confirmation, backed by an alarming stochastics setup in neutral territory.
7 A-Rated Biotech Stocks to Buy Now
This semiconductor stock is a short. However, to play the part of a smarter bear, I’d suggest a September $55/$52.50 bear put spread to fully appreciate a price correction in INTC stock toward price and Fibonacci support from roughly $47.50 to $52.50 a share.
Semiconductor Stocks: Nvidia (NVDA)

Source: Charts by TradingView
The last of our semiconductor stocks to trade is Nvidia. What can you say about the Nasdaq’s most valuable chip play? If nothing else, it’s that the price momentum responsible for adding nearly 37% in 2021 and ballooning NVDA stock’s valuation to $450 billion isn’t finished. And that makes Nvidia a buy today.
Technically, this semi has been painting the tape green for a third straight month. Shares are hitting record highs after a “gotcha” pattern above and below triangle support took both bulls and bears for unprofitable thrill rides. Today is a different story though.
Right now thrill seekers have every reason to buckle up for more upside with stochastics bullishly crossing over in neutral territory. And bottom line, NVDA’s squiggly price line should make even Redditors typically focused on short-squeeze plays like AMC (NYSE:AMC) or cryptos such as Dogecoin (CCC:DOGE-USD) take notice.
To position for continued momentum in this semiconductor stock, I’d simply and smartly go with buying into NVDA’s price strength with an August $730/$790 bull call spread.

2021-06-17 00:00:00+00:00,U.S. senators propose 25% tax credit for semiconductor manufacturing,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/u.s.-senators-propose-25-tax-credit-for-semiconductor-manufacturing-2021-06-17,,,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON, June 17 (Reuters) - A bipartisan group of U.S. senators on Thursday proposed a 25% tax credit for investments in semiconductor manufacturing as Congress works to increase U.S. chip production.
The proposal sponsored by Senate Finance Committee Chairman Ron Wyden and the top Republican Senator Mike Crapo along with
four other senators would provide ""reasonable, targeted incentives for domestic semiconductor manufacturing,"" they said in a statement.
The group did not immediately respond to a request for a cost estimate for the measure, which is on top of recent semiconductor funding. Last week, the Senate approved $52 billion for production and research on semiconductors and telecommunications equipment. That included $2 billion dedicated to chips used by automakers, which have seen massive shortages and made significant production cuts.
Supporters of funding note the U.S. share of semiconductors and microelectronics production has fallen to 12% from 37% in 1990.
The senators said up to 70% of the cost difference for producing semiconductors overseas results from foreign subsidies.
""The United States can’t allow foreign governments to continue to lure companies’ manufacturing overseas, increasing risks to our economy and costing American workers good-paying jobs,"" Wyden said.
U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said last month the funding could result in seven to 10 new U.S. semiconductor plants.
Raimondo anticipates government funding would generate ""$150 billion-plus"" in investment in chip production and research - including contributions from state and federal governments and private-sector firms.
""We just need the federal money ... to unlock private capital,"" Raimondo said.
The tax credit could benefit Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC) 5425.TWO, which is building a $12 billion semiconductor factory in Arizona, and Dutch chipmaker NXP Semiconductors NV NXPI.O as well as U.S. firms such as Intel Corp INTC.O and Micron Technology Inc MU.O.

June 17 (Reuters) - Advanced Micro Devices Inc AMD.O and Alphabet Inc's GOOGL.O Google Cloud on Thursday said Google will offer cloud computing services based on AMD's newest data center chip, a move likely to intensify AMD's push to grab market share from rival Intel Corp INTC.O.
Cloud computing providers such as Google, Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O and Microsoft Corp MSFT.O are some of the biggest buyers of data center chips. They build services on top of the chips to rent the computing power out to millions of customers.
Google said on Thursday it will start offering services based on AMD's ""Milan"" server chip, which AMD released in March. Google said customers such as Snap Inc SNAP.N and Twitter Inc TWTR.N are testing the new AMD-based services.
AMD has been gaining market share against Intel, which was long the dominant player in data center chips but whose offerings have inferior performance on some measures because of years of stumbles in Intel's manufacturing operations.
Intel in April announced its ""Ice Lake"" chip competitor to AMD's ""Milan"" chip and said all major cloud providers would support it, but Intel has not said when Google will start offering services based on its latest chip.

2021-06-16 00:00:00+00:00,Qualcomm's Interest in Arm Reveals Its Greatest Fear,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/qualcomms-interest-in-arm-reveals-its-greatest-fear-2021-06-16,,,"Qualcomm's (NASDAQ: QCOM) incoming CEO, Cristiano Amon, recently told The Telegraph his company would be interested in buying a stake in Arm Holdings with a consortium of other investors if regulators block NVIDIA's (NASDAQ: NVDA) $40 billion bid for the chip designer.
Amon suggested the consortium could make that investment if Softbank (OTC: SFTB.Y) spins off Arm, which it acquired in 2016, in an IPO. In a statement, NVIDIA dismissed Qualcomm's suggestion and declared that taking Arm public again would throttle its development of new chip designs.
Qualcomm's statement marks a continuation of its protests against NVIDIA's takeover of Arm, which was initially announced last September. Let's see why Qualcomm desperately wants to keep Arm out of NVIDIA's hands, and why its desire to buy a stake in Arm also reveals its greatest fear.
Image source: Getty Images.
Reviewing Qualcomm's weaknesses
Qualcomm is one of the world's largest producers of mobile chips and baseband modems. It also owns the largest portfolio of cellular patents. In the earlier days of smartphones, Qualcomm comfortably dominated the mobile chip market with its Snapdragon SoCs (systems on chips), which bundle together application processors, GPUs, and modems. Its licensing business also collected royalties from every smartphone maker worldwide -- even those that didn't use Qualcomm's chips.
But over the past year, Taiwanese chipmaker MediaTek (OTC: MDTKF) overtook Qualcomm as the world's largest mobile chipmaker. Between the first quarters of 2020 and 2021, MediaTek'sglobal marketshare rose from 24% to 35%, according to Counterpoint Research, as Qualcomm's share dipped from 31% to 29%. Top smartphone makers, including Apple, Samsung, and Huawei, also continued to use their own first-party application processors instead of Qualcomm's chips.
Antitrust regulators have also forced Qualcomm to reduce its licensing fees in several major markets, including China, over the past few years. That pressure throttled the growth of its licensing business, which had previously generated much higher-margin revenue than its chipmaking business.
In the past Qualcomm pushed other mobile chipmakers, including NVIDIA and Texas Instruments (NASDAQ: TXN), out of the market by bundling its chips with lower licensing fees. NVIDIA and TI couldn't match those prices, so they eventually surrendered the smartphone market to Qualcomm.
Arm is the ultimate gatekeeper of mobile chips
In that context, it seems ironic for Qualcomm to oppose NVIDIA's takeover of Arm. However, the deal could threaten Qualcomm in two ways.
First, Arm only collects royalties from its chip designs; it doesn't manufacture chips. About 95% of all mobile chips across the world -- including those produced by Qualcomm, NVIDIA, Apple, Samsung, and Huawei -- use Arm's designs.
Image source: Getty Images.
After buying Arm, NVIDIA won't need to pay Arm any royalties on its own Tegra SoCs -- which are primarily used in cars, gaming consoles, and set-top boxes -- and it will collect royalties from all the other Arm chipmakers.
That shift could also enable NVIDIA to make its Tegra SoCs cheaper than Qualcomm's Snapdragon SoCs. The Tegra hasn't been aimed at smartphones since NVIDIA discontinued its Icera modem business in 2015, but the chipset could still challenge Qualcomm in markets that don't require cellular connections -- such as connected TVs and Arm-based PCs.
Second, Qualcomm believes NVIDIA could eventually prevent Arm, which is often called the ""Switzerland of chips"" for its neutral positioning, from offering its most advanced chip designs to chipmakers other than NVIDIA. NVIDIA dismissed those claims, but its recent introduction of the Grace CPU -- a high-end Arm-based chip for data centers -- indicates it has big plans for Arm-based chips beyond the Tegra.
Qualcomm has repeatedly failed to crack the data center market, which is dominated by Intel, with its higher-end Arm-based chips. However, NVIDIA might produce a much more powerful data center chip by pumping more cash into Arm -- and quietly keep those designs to itself.
Should Qualcomm's investors worry?
NVIDIA's takeover of Arm still faces many hurdles, including antitrust probes across the world and legal battles against the CEO of Arm China, who has refused to resign after being ousted by the board. Therefore, NVIDIA will likely need to make major concessions before the deal is approved.
In other words, a doomsday scenario for Qualcomm -- in which NVIDIA hoards all of Arm's latest designs, raises licensing fees across the board, and launches more advanced Arm chips to challenge its Snapdragon chips -- probably won't occur. NVIDIA will also likely focus on the PC gaming and data center markets instead of clashing with Qualcomm again in mobile chips.
Buying a stake in Arm would help Qualcomm, since it could reduce is own licensing fees, but an NVIDIA takeover also won't derail its growth. For now, Qualcomm's investors should pay more attention to MediaTek, which is gradually creeping into the high-end smartphone market, and the global chip shortage, which could throttle its shipments this year.

2021-06-16 00:00:00+00:00,Investing in the Intel Turnaround? Don't Be Too Quick to Draw Comparisons With AMD,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/investing-in-the-intel-turnaround-dont-be-too-quick-to-draw-comparisons-with-amd-2021-06,,,"The world's largest semiconductor company (as measured by revenue), Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), has not been having a good go of it as of late. The company has fallen behind technologically to leading chip fabrication behemoth Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE: TSM), and myriad other chip designers like NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) have been scooping up sales from Intel's dominant PC and data center biz.
Intel has a plan to invest heavily in its fabrication process and revamp its product designs, though, and some investors have drawn parallels between Intel now and where scrappy general purpose chip company AMD (NASDAQ: AMD) was in the years following the Great Recession of 2008-2009.
I'm not so sure it's a good comparison. Intel of 2021 is nothing like AMD of the early 2010s. Intel may indeed be a long-term value trading at just 12.5 times trailing-12-month free cash flow as of this writing. But don't expect a massive resurgence like AMD experienced -- one that has sent AMD stock soaring 950% over the last 10-year stretch. Intel has serious issues that won't be solved by a simple ""turnaround story."" Here are two simple reasons why.
Image source: Getty Images.
Intel isn't called ""chipzilla"" for nothing
First consider the fact that a turnaround story for Intel would simply mean it gets to hold on to its leadership in market share of the global chip industry. With nearly $78 billion in total revenue over the last year, Intel alone accounts for nearly 20% of global spending on semiconductors.
In stark contrast, AMD was a tiny player in the industry in 2012, when it started getting aggressive with its restructuring plan (it spun off GlobalFoundries as a separate entity that year, but more on that in a moment). Nearly a decade ago, global semiconductor spend was sitting at about $300 billion a year, and AMD hauled in just $5.4 billion in sales that year (less than 2%global marketshare) to Intel's $53 billion (about 18% market share, close to the same as today).
The point here is that AMD wasn't just trying to find its way again. It also had a lot to gain at the expense of some much bigger rivals when it embarked on its makeover. Intel is (and has been for a long time) the global chip leader. While the semiconductor industry is still a growth trend, Intel has the most to lose -- not the most to gain from getting itself back on track. And right now its business is stagnating while peers like AMD, NVIDIA, and others grow at a double-digit percentage clip. This is a very different situation than what faced AMD 10 years ago.
No drastic action to simplify its operations
Today, AMD's sales have grown to about 3% share of global spend -- and this is without the help of its former fabrication business GlobalFoundries (GloFo) that it spun off in 2012. You see, as part of AMD's rebound, it decided to narrow its research and development focus only to chip design, then contract actual manufacturing out to GloFo and other firms (like the aforementioned Taiwan Semiconductor). The simplification strategy worked, and AMD's product suite is now taking lunch from Intel.
To date, Intel plans to make a comeback by doubling down on its manufacturing business, and tapping other foundries to manufacture some of its own designs. Additionally, it might license out its chip architecture to other designers, a licensing strategy employed by ARM (which is in the regulatory review process before being acquired by NVIDIA) that has turned licensees like Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Alphabet's (NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) Google into chip engineers too. Put simply, the semiconductor landscape is changing, and Intel has no focus. Sounds like a complicated mess to me.
Intel has said it will be investing $20 billion to construct some new fabrication lines. Sounds like a bold move, but this kind of construction takes years to complete. In the meantime, other outfits (again, Taiwan Semiconductor) have already been in the process of upgrading their manufacturing tech all along. Intel won't be able to just simply throw money at this problem to get a quick fix. Catching up on the technology curve is no small task, and more drastic action (like AMD shrinking in 2012 with the longer-term goal of becoming a bigger chip designer) is often needed to pull it off.
The positive spin here is that Intel has deep pockets and spends tens of billions of dollars every year on new research and development. Who knows what kind of tricks it might be able to pull out of its wide-brimmed hat? However, this is a very large ship, and getting it to turn won't be nearly as easy as it was to turn AMD around a decade ago. Since it's already the world's largest chip company by sales and has dozens of smaller peers nipping at its heels, I think there are far better places to invest money for the long term in the semiconductor industry than a possible Intel ""turnaround"" story.

But that quote is often misunderstood -- it doesn't mean the Oracle of Omaha never sells any stocks. It also doesn't mean investors should stubbornly hold on to shares of broken businesses.
Instead, stocks that can be held forever often share three strengths: They dominate their respective markets, they generate plenty of cash, and they still have decades of growth ahead. Here are three stocks in my portfolio that check all three boxes: Disney (NYSE: DIS), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), and ASML Holding (NASDAQ: ASML).
Image source: Getty Images.
1. Disney
I accumulated most of my shares of Disney in 2012, 2014, and 2016. I expected the growth of its film and theme park businesses -- buoyed by Marvel, Star Wars, Pixar, and its other evergreen franchises -- to offset the impact of cord cutters on its cable business.
Disney has repeatedly tested my patience over the years, especially with the costly expansion of its streaming platforms and the shutdown of movie theaters and theme parks during the pandemic. Yet I stuck with Disney because no other entertainment company can match its long-term appeal.
Disney's network of theme parks should continue to evolve and expand, its box office hits should outweigh its bombs, and Disney+ will likely achieve its goal of 230 million to 260 million subscribers by the end of fiscal 2024 -- and finally silence any lingering concerns about its loss of cable TV viewers.
Disney already generated a total return of more than 400% over the past decade, but I believe its growth engines will propel it even higher over the long term -- which makes it a great stock to hold forever.
2. Amazon
I bought most of my shares in Amazon in 2015 and 2016. I turned bullish on Amazon after it started disclosing the profitability of its cloud platform AWS (Amazon Web Services), since I realized it could easily support the expansion of its lower-margin retail business with the cloud unit's profits.
None of Amazon's brick-and-mortar and online competitors had that unique strength. Meanwhile, Amazon leveraged AWS' growth to expand its e-commerce ecosystem with lower-margin and loss-leading strategies, including new perks for Prime members and cheap hardware devices.
That virtuous cycle generated plenty of cash for fresh acquisitions, including its $13.7 billion takeover of Whole Foods in 2017 and its planned takeover of MGM Studios for $8.5 billion. Those acquisitions highlight Amazon's unique ability to expand across seemingly unrelated sectors, then tether those sectors' customers back to its prisoner-taking Prime ecosystem of over 200 million paid subscribers.
Amazon is already synonymous with online shopping in many countries, and AWS is already the world's largest cloud infrastructure platform. I expect both businesses to remain strong for decades to come -- and I'm willing to hold on to my shares to profit from those gains.
3. ASML
ASML is one of the latest additions to my portfolio. I started accumulating shares of the Dutch semiconductor equipment maker in early March for a simple reason: The world's top chipmakers can't manufacture their most advanced chips without its lithography systems.
ASML sells the world's most sophisticated EUV (extreme ultraviolet) lithography systems, which print circuit patterns onto silicon wafers. The world's most advanced chip foundries -- TSMC (NYSE: TSM), Samsung, and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) -- all need to use its EUV systems.
ASML developed its technology over the past two decades, so it doesn't face any meaningful competitors in the high-end EUV space. As a result, its margins continue to expand, and it consistently plows its excess cash into buybacks and dividends.
In the near-term, ASML will benefit from the ongoing semiconductor shortage as the world's largest foundries purchase even more EUV systems. It's also getting ready to roll out next-gen EUV systems, called high-NA systems, for the production of even smaller chips. Over the long term, ASML will remain the linchpin of the global semiconductor market -- and remain a rock-solid long-term investment.

2021-06-16 00:00:00+00:00,ANALYSIS-Nvidia's closing of $40 bln Arm deal could hinge on Europe,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/analysis-nvidias-closing-of-%2440-bln-arm-deal-could-hinge-on-europe-2021-06-16,,,"By Stephen Nellis and Foo Yun Chee
June 15 (Reuters) - Nvidia Corp NVDA.O may not be able to meet a March 2022 deadline for closing its $40 billion acquisition of British chip technology firm Arm Ltd due to European regulators' reluctance to consider the case until after the summer holidays, people familiar with the matter told Reuters.
Nvidia announced the Arm deal last year, sparking an immediate backlash in the semiconductor industry, where Arm has long been a neutral player licensing key intellectual property to customers who are otherwise intense rivals, including Qualcomm Inc QCOM.O, Samsung Electronics Co Ltd 005930.KS and Apple Inc AAPL.O.
The company needs regulatory approval from U.S., European and Chinese authorities, all of which are expected to scrutinize the transaction closely. While Nvidia told investors last year that it plans to close the deal by March 2022, the purchase agreement gives the two companies the option to extend the deadline to September 2022. But at that point, either party has the option to walk away if the deal does not receive government approval.
Nvidia has not yet filed an application to clear the deal with the European Commission. Officials there have made it clear to the company that they need until September to gather enough information to accept Nvidia's formal application for approval, according to three people familiar with the matter.
That could make it difficult for Nvidia to close the deal by March of next year as planned, these people said. Technology news publication The Information earlier on Tuesday reported the possibility of a delayed filing in Europe.
The U.S. Federal Trade Commission has been gathering information about the deal, people familiar with the matter told Reuters. Nvidia has filed for approval of the deal in China, the Financial Times reported last week.
In a statement, Nvidia said that “many jurisdictions have a pre-notification period, where the parties have a detailed and ongoing dialogue with regulators. Our discussions with regulators have been thorough and constructive. We’ll continue to work throughout the summer, as we anticipated all along, and expect to close in early 2022.”
By the letter of the law in Europe, Nvidia can file its application at any time. But in practice, regulatory attorneys said, most companies wait until receiving an informal go-ahead from regulators before formally filing.
One regulatory attorney who has worked on European deals said a move to file before regulators have signaled they are ready to act on the application would be ""suicidal"" for Nvidia's good relations with European regulators.
""After nine months, the commission still feels there are very serious concerns,"" the attorney said. ""They are not ready to take this filing. If Nvidia goes down this road, it's a very confrontational strategy with a very powerful agency.""
The Nvidia-Arm deal also faces headwinds in the United Kingdom, which has said it will conduct a national security review of the deal. Headquartered in Cambridge, England, Arm is considered a crown jewel of the country's tech industry, and British regulators required it to set UK headcount targets before allowing it to be sold to Japan's SoftBank Group Corp 9984.T in 2016.
Nvidia's stock has risen 37% this year, versus a 12% rise in the Nasdaq composite .IXIC.
The fear among chip firms is that Nvidia will give itself early access to Arm's innovations rather than distributing them to the entire industry on an equal basis. Nvidia and Arm officials have told Reuters they intend to keep ""firewalls"" in place at the combined company to prevent that from happening.
Questions on how Nvidia will run Arm took on new urgency in April when Nvidia said it will make an Arm-based central processor chip for data centers, its first major Arm effort and the centerpiece of its strategy to challenge rivals Intel Corp INTC.O and Advanced Micro Devices Inc AMD.O.

Nokia (NYSE:NOK), the Finnish telecom company, changed its dividend policy on Mar. 18 with its Capital Markets Day presentation. After having withheld a dividend payment last year even though the company was profitable, it has now decided to “update” its policy. As a result, NOK stock might have a chance of moving significantly higher this year — if it starts paying out.

Of course, it’s not as though the stock has been languishing. For example, year-to-date (YTD), NOK stock is up from $3.91 on Dec. 31 to $5.22 as of Jun. 16. That represents a YTD gain of 33.5% so far this year.
That said, NOK stock has also risen just over 22% in the past one year. This is not a bad result necessarily, but nothing to really write home about. However, let’s not get picky. After all, both Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and AT&T (NYSE:T) are still negative in their 12-month performances.
NOK Stock: Estimating the Potential Dividend
Here’s exactly what Nokia’s new updated dividend policy stated:
“Today, Nokia also updated its dividend policy. It is target [sic] recurring, stable and over time growing ordinary dividend payments, taking into account the previous year’s earnings as well as the company’s financial position and business outlook.”
This means that the company will no longer pay a variable dividend as a percent of profits. That is what U.K. and European companies do. Instead, it now wants to follow the American policy of paying a steady dividend. In addition, Nokia provided an updated forecast for 2021, saying that it would “assess the possibility of proposing a dividend distribution for the financial year 2021 based on the updated dividend policy.”

7 A-Rated Biotech Stocks to Buy Now
Analysts now estimate that Nokia will make $26.18 billion in revenue this year and $26.7 billion in 2022. Moreover, in the first quarter, the company’s free cash flow (FCF) was about $1.35 billion, based on figures from Seeking Alpha. This implies a run-rate annual FCF of $5.4 billion. That represents a very high FCF margin of 20.6% for this year alone. By 2022, its FCF would be about $5.5 billion.
Using this number, we can estimate the potential dividend payment. Most companies pay out one-third to one-half of their FCF. Let’s say that Nokia decides to pay out one-third, or $1.79 billion. In 2022, the dividend would be $1.83 billion.
Today, NOK stock has a market capitalization of $29.6 billion. So, the one-third of FCF dividend payment in 2021 would represent a dividend yield of 6.04% (i.e., $1.79 billion / $29.6 billion). This implies a dividend of 31.5 cents per share (i.e., 6.04% x today’s price of $5.22).
What to Do with NOK Stock
For comparison, Intel currently has a dividend yield of 2.4% while AT&T has a 7.10% dividend yield. I use these two stocks simply because they are non-performing tech stocks that still pay a dividend. The mid-point between them is 4.75%.
So, if we use a 4.75% dividend yield, NOK stock should be priced at $6.63 per share. Here’s why: if we take the potential dividend of 31.5 cents per share and divide it by 4.75%, the result is $6.63.
This also implies that NOK stock is worth 27% more using its current price and the estimate of $6.63 per share. This is based on a conservative estimate of its dividend payout and a typical dividend yield. But keep in mind that, if the company decides to pay out a higher portion of its FCF, the stock will be worth considerably more.
Moreover, assuming Nokia pays out one-third of 2022 FCF, the dividend yield will be 6.18% (i.e., $1.83 billion / $29.6 billion market value). This implies a dividend of 32.3 cents. Therefore, using a 4.75% dividend yield, the target price is $6.80.
What does this all mean? In my view, sometime between now and the end of 2022, NOK stock will likely rise between $6.63 and $6.80, or to the midpoint of $6.71. That implies a potential return on investment (ROI) of nearly 29% from today. In addition, it could be significantly higher if the payout ratio is closer to 50%.

2021-06-15 00:00:00+00:00,ANALYSIS-Nvidia's closing of $40 bln Arm deal could hinge on Europe,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/analysis-nvidias-closing-of-%2440-bln-arm-deal-could-hinge-on-europe-2021-06-15,,,"By Stephen Nellis and Foo Yun Chee
June 15 (Reuters) - Nvidia Corp NVDA.O may not be able to meet a March 2022 deadline for closing its $40 billion acquisition of British chip technology firm Arm Ltd due to European regulators' reluctance to consider the case until after the summer holidays, people familiar with the matter told Reuters.
Nvidia announced the Arm deal last year, sparking an immediate backlash in the semiconductor industry, where Arm has long been a neutral player licensing key intellectual property to customers who are otherwise intense rivals, including Qualcomm Inc QCOM.O, Samsung Electronics Co Ltd 005930.KS and Apple Inc AAPL.O.
The company needs regulatory approval from U.S., European and Chinese authorities, all of which are expected to scrutinize the transaction closely. While Nvidia told investors last year that it plans to close the deal by March 2022, the purchase agreement gives the two companies the option to extend the deadline to September 2022. But at that point, either party has the option to walk away if the deal does not receive government approval.
Nvidia has not yet filed an application to clear the deal with the European Commission. Officials there have made it clear to the company that they need until September to gather enough information to accept Nvidia's formal application for approval, according to three people familiar with the matter.
That could make it difficult for Nvidia to close the deal by March of next year as planned, these people said.
The U.S. Federal Trade Commission has been gathering information about the deal, people familiar with the matter told Reuters. Nvidia has filed approval of the deal in China, the Financial Times reported last week.
In a statement, Nvidia said that “many jurisdictions have a pre-notification period, where the parties have a detailed and ongoing dialogue with regulators. Our discussions with regulators have been thorough and constructive. We’ll continue to work throughout the summer, as we anticipated all along, and expect to close in early 2022.”
By the letter of the law in Europe, Nvidia can file its application at any time. But in practice, regulatory attorneys said, most companies wait until receiving an informal go-ahead from regulators before formally filing.
One regulatory attorney who has worked on European deals said a move to file before regulators have signaled they are ready to act on the application would be ""suicidal"" for Nvidia's good relations with European regulators.
""After nine months, the commission still feels there are very serious concerns,"" the attorney said. ""They are not ready to take this filing. If Nvidia goes down this road, it's a very confrontational strategy with a very powerful agency.""
The Nvidia-Arm deal also faces headwinds in the United Kingdom, which has said it will conduct a national security review of the deal. Headquartered in Cambridge, England, Arm is considered a crown jewel of the country's tech industry, and British regulators required it to set UK headcount targets before allowing it to be sold to Japan's SoftBank Group Corp 9984.T in 2016.

Bloomberg reports that Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) has made a $2 billion offer to acquire SiFive. SiFive designs processors using the open-source RISC-V standard and sells the designs to its customers, similar to rival ARM.
So What?
There could be a couple of factors driving Intel’s interest. Firstly, with Nvidia’s planned deal for British chip design major ARM, customers of ARMs services could be looking to hedge their bets with designs from another company, such as SiFive. Secondly, Intel is also looking to double down on the foundry space and it could potentially sell CPU designs from SiFive as well as fabrication services to customers.

In the last couple of years, Intel has been losing market share to AMD (NASDAQ: AMD) and NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA), but it feels as if the company has reached rock bottom, and it might be the perfect time to pick up some shares.
On paper, things look better than what you might hear. The company reported non-GAAP revenue of $18.6 billion, flat year over year, which exceeded January guidance by $1.1 billion. And if this is rock bottom, the only way is up.
The comeback
Twenty-five years ago, the U.S. manufactured 37% of the semiconductors in the world. Today that number is down to 12%. You've probably heard this before, but there's a global chip shortage, and it's affecting most if not all industries on the planet because semiconductors nowadays are used in almost everything. For example, automakers are expected to lose $60 billion globally due to the chip shortage.
Intel recently announced a $20 billion factory expansion in Arizona. Intel will be offering contract manufacturing jobs, and this will become a core part of the business. Last year Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) ditched Intel for TSMC (NYSE: TSM) because Apple is starting to manufacture its own chips and because TSMC can make five-nanometer chips while Intel can't. But with the new factory being built in the United States, Apple might want to diversify where it gets its chips from, and that might be a win for Intel.
Even if Intel can't reach TSMC's level, it can certainly take a significant chunk. But in the meantime, Intel is set to outsource select CPU production to TSMC.
Mobileye
In 2017, Intel acquired Mobileye for $15.3 billion. Mobileye develops self-driving cars and advanced driver-assistance systems. Last quarter, it generated $377 million, up 48% year over year. As we move toward self-driving cars, we can expect this segment of Intel's revenue to grow significantly over the years. As cars and the world in general become more digital, the demand for semiconductors will only increase.
If we can learn something from AMD's comeback in recent years, it's that nothing is impossible. Obviously this isn't a guaranteed success, far from it. Building new factories will take time, and making high-end processors isn't easy, either. But AMD's moving in the right direction.

asdaq and global asset manager Invesco are expanding their partnership with the launch of two new exchange-traded funds (ETFs), the Invesco Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF (IBBQ) and the Invesco PHLX Semiconductor ETF (SOXQ).
The new ETFs track the Nasdaq Biotechnology Index (NBI) and PHLX Semiconductor Sector Index (SOX), both of which are the longest-standing benchmarks for the respective themes that have become increasingly relevant amid the global pandemic.
The biotech index provides access to over 270 innovative companies listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market, including large-, mid- and small-cap companies at every stage of growth. Some of the securities in IBBQ include Amgen (AMGN), Gilead Sciences (GILD), Illumina (ILMN), Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) and Moderna (MRNA). Meanwhile, the semiconductor index includes the 30 largest names in semiconductor design and manufacturing, such as Texas Instruments (TXN), Intel (INTC), Broadcom (AVGO), QUALCOMM (QCOM) and NVIDIA (NVDA). 
“We are excited to expand our relationship with Nasdaq in order to offer investors another way to access innovative companies currently shaping the way we live and work,” said Invesco’s Global Head of ETFs and Indexed Strategies Anna Paglia. “There has never been a more relevant moment for these two themes, and we are happy that we could ensure investors now have the most cost-effective way to invest in Nasdaq-listed companies through indexes that have been live for almost three decades.”
With the Invesco Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF and the Invesco PHLX Semiconductor ETF, Invesco aims to have the most competitively priced products in their respective categories. While the new ETFs each have a total expense ratio of 19 basis points, Invesco, in partnership with Nasdaq, will waive advisory fees of both ETFs until Dec. 17, 2021, “effectively bringing the total expense ratio of each ETF to 0 basis points,” the press release noted.
“Adding these two ETFs bolsters our already robust offerings in the technology sector and thematic industries within that sector,” said Paglia. “Invesco continues to expand its ETF offerings to provide clients with the ability to select the exposures to help them produce the best outcomes.”
The addition of these new ETFs builds upon Invesco’s innovation suite, which encompasses the Invesco QQQ ETF (QQQ), the Invesco Nasdaq-100 ETF (QQQM), the Invesco Nasdaq-100 Index Fund (IVNQX) and the Invesco Nasdaq Next Gen 100 ETF (QQQJ).
“Nasdaq is proud to be the exchange partner to a global community of healthcare and semiconductor leaders,” said Lauren Dillard, Executive Vice President and Head of Investment Intelligence for Nasdaq. “Leveraging our rules-based and transparent indexes, we are pleased to build on our partnership with Invesco, bringing investment products that enable investors to gain meaningful exposure to the pioneering companies who are transforming tomorrow.”

This video was recorded on June 2, 2021.
Chris Hill: It's Wednesday, June 2nd. Welcome to MarketFoolery. I'm Chris Hill, with me today, our man in Colorado, Tim Beyers. Good to see you.
Tim Beyers: Good to see you, sir. How are you today?
Hill: I'm good, we have another acquisition to discuss. We've got news in the semiconductor chip industry, but we're going to start today with the Zoom Video. First quarter revenue grew 191%, and I'm laughing because that seems like a made up number, but it grew 191%. Gross margins are getting fatter, and yet shares of Zoom Video are down a couple of percentage points due to guidance. I get that the growth is slowing down, Tim, but I looked at this quarter and I just thought, I don't think I would want to be in the position of having to make a strong bear case against Zoom Video.
Beyers: No, I mean, can you imagine? I guess here's my question for anybody, and maybe I'll pose to you Chris. The investor on the other side here, potentially. Zoom is disappointing like, ""How many yachts can you water-ski behind?"" like, ""How many yards are you going to water ski behind?"" Come on, what do you want here? When I look at these numbers, Chris, and let's just hit some of them very quickly here. Just under $1.6 billion in free cash flow, that includes a pretty fat contribution from stock-based compensation, but not a ton under $350 million. This is an inorganically growing business, like you said, revenue up 191%, $956.2 million. Remember that the consensus here was, I think, $906 million. They didn't just edge out the consensus here, they blew the doors off the consensus. 497,000 customers, that's up 87% year over year. 12th consecutive quarter of dollar-based net expansion rate up 130% or higher. Large customers, those that are spending at least $100,000 a year on Zoom, that's up over 160%. This company, I don't like to necessarily quote my boss, Ron Gross, but firing on all cylinders. Firing on all cylinders, right?
Hill: Of all the numbers you just hit, that one at the end there in terms of the people who are paying them the most money and sort of what direction that's going. Because we talk about this all the time, whatever business you're in, the cost of acquiring new customers is expensive. It's certainly more expensive than keeping them. If you're keeping them satisfied, then they're going to stay with you because there are switching costs associated with switching away from Zoom video, particularly if your business if you're saying, ""Okay, we're not happy with them. We're going to go with the solution offered by Cisco Systems."" or some other company. They're doing a good job taking care of their customers because keep in mind, you go back 15 months and that was the question about Zoom Video. It was, ""Well, sure. Everyone's using them now that the pandemic has started because they've got this free solution. But how many people are going to pay them?"" Here we are, 15 months later. Turns out the short answer is a lot. A lot of businesses are going to pay them.
Beyers: Right. I mean, you can just imagine. You can almost imagine it here where you have the consensus, saying ""Hey, Zoom is just a pandemic stock."" and Eric Yuan saying, ""Can you see my numbers? Here's a nice tall glass so shut the heck up."" I mean, come on. What do you want for me here? But let's just hit a couple of other things here because what you said, Chris, I think is really illuminating. The first is that when you have customers that want to stick with you and spend more than your unit economic costs go down. The net effect of that when you look at the financials here, you get a fatter balance sheet and your cash flow goes up. Your turning more dollars that you sell into actual cash you can use to reinvest in the business. I ran a couple of numbers here, Chris, just for some perspective. There is a metric that I used called cash flow return on investment. Essentially the idea here is, when a company generates a dollar of cash from its business, how does it put that dollar to work to generate new assets and then keep that from creating new liabilities on its balance sheet. The higher the number, it's sort of an indicator, if not a perfect indicator of what sometimes we call return on invested capital, like this business takes a buck, puts it back into its business and generates a return on it.
With Zoom, even if you take out the contributions from stock-based comp, it's over 30%. That's a massive number. We're not in the middle of the pandemic anymore, these are not artificially inflated numbers. I think when I look at this business, Chris, it reminds me a lot of Microsoft, let's say 20 years ago. It has a business that appeals to consumers in a way, giving consumers that are using this, using the free version. Then you have companies that are saying, ""This is a part of our workflow."" It's like ""Hey, I'm going to use maybe some of the free office tools. But as a company, I got to have Word, I got to have Excel. I'm going to pay the money to have the Office Suite. I think that's what's happening with Zoom.
Hill: Let's move on to the semiconductor industry. Taiwan Semiconductors is in the news because they're building a new factory in Arizona, they plan to spend $12 billion on the project. Because there's a chip shortage and because by the way, the U.S. Federal government is talking about spending tens of billions of dollars in subsidies for the semiconductor chip industry. This seems like the type of investment that you would want to see if you were a Taiwan Semiconductor shareholder.
Beyers: You absolutely want to see it. I'm a Taiwan Semiconductor shareholder and here's the thing, so this groundbreaking is now there won't be any real production here until what appears to be 2024. But here's why this is so important for Taiwan Semi and if you're a Taiwan Semiconductor shareholder, they are still the biggest manufacturer of Apple chips. Let me tell you how good it looks come 2024 when Apple says hey, we're going to build our M2 chip, right now it's M1 chip and all the Macs, we're going to build the M2 chip in Arizona, we're going to source all of our iPhone chips and all of our iOS device chips. We're going to do that in Arizona and we have an American-made story, that's amazing. It's what the Biden administration wants, I think that's what Americans want too. We were thinking for a while there, Chris, that this was going to be a little bit of an Intel story that Intel was going to come back, it was going to get government money, it was going to stand up new fabrication facilities and we're going to have an American company with American-made chips into computers and devices here in U.S. shores. It turns out the Taiwan Semiconductor has said, ""You know what? Give us a piece of that action and we will invest in your country."" I think that's a brilliant move by Taiwan Semiconductor, and I expect it to pay off long-term if for no other reason that you keep happy the customer that is paying a big chunk of your bills, and that's Apple.
Hill: So, there are few essentially macroeconomic stories that have gone on over the last six months.
Beyers: Yeah.
Hill: At some point when you're looking at these stories somewhere on the list of questions. For all of them you get to the question, when is this going to stop?
Beyers: Right.
Hill: Housing prices and the spiking housing prices that we've seen across the country. Looking at that and saying, when is that going to stop or slow down? I think another one is the semiconductor chip shortage.
Beyers: Absolutely.
Hill: Which affects so many industries. Obviously, they're just starting these plans to build this factory two years before it's online, what should we be watching for, if not as investors just as consumers to feel, OK, we're through the worst of this shortage, or are we already through the worst of it?
Beyers: I don't think we're through the worst of it and I think it's going to be a long term shortage, Chris, because the way the semiconductor industry works is you have to build capacity far ahead of actually delivering product. The semiconductor industry works in cycles, let's say you build out a new process for manufacturing chips at a much smaller form factor and you have companies like Intel and AMD and NVIDIA putting out their road maps way in advance so that you have the supply chain actually building out and fine-tuning equipment to be able to manufacturer chips at the scale they are talking about, put that equipment into fabrication facilities like what you have at Taiwan Semiconductor and it can be two, three years. I think you're going to see supply constraints, maybe not the same extreme shortage that we've been seeing recently, but I think you're going to see constraints for multiple years. If you're a Taiwan Semiconductor investor, that gives Taiwan Semi a little bit of pricing power, it allows them to be selective, it allows them to keep their customers close and they can be fairly well assured. I'm not going to say it's impossible, but it's a little difficult for Taiwan Semiconductor to get over its skis over the next three years. Chris, does that make sense?
Hill: That makes sense.
Beyers: When I look at it, I really do believe this company is very well-positioned and to put a final point on your question to answer it, if there's something you had to look forward to say, have we moved from extreme shortage to maybe constrained? I think just look at the backlog, look at things like the PC backlog. If it takes you to say, two weeks to get your new Mac instead of two months, things are improving.
Hill: Let's move on to Etsy, because Etsy is buying Depop, a second hand fashion app. They're paying $1.6 billion. Depop, which I've never heard of before this morning.
Beyers: Me either.
Hill: It lets people buy and sell used clothes through its online marketplace. They've got 30 million users on their platform. Shares of Etsy were up 2% this morning. That tells me they got a good deal at a good price, did they?
Beyers: I think they did. Let's be clear about something that Etsy gets very little credit for. This is a cash-generating monster. Etsy generates a ton of cash every single year. Let me just pull up the numbers here, what I show is around $795 million in free cash flow just over the trailing 12 months here, Chris. Clearly, there's a premium here. Depop would not sell if they weren't selling at some kind of premium. We know that that's happening but how long is it going to take Etsy to draw down its cash and pay this out? Probably less than a year, maybe six months to pay that out, tuck it in, and make it an important part of its branded offerings. I think it's very smart for Etsy as it builds out brand because here's the thing that as far as Etsy is concerned, the brand is Etsy. It's not like Etsy is a holding company and it has a bunch of brands and those brands are attractive and it benefits from that. Just like Apple has Beats by Dre, people do want Beats. So, here's an opportunity for Etsy to go out and say, ""You know what, here's a brand that you know, we have all of the infrastructure, all of the mechanisms to keep Depop what it is, it's still amazing, and now we're going to give you more logistical support. We are going to make it easier to buy, we're going to give you everything you need but this is still the same brand that you love. I think it's an interesting tuck-in acquisition, Chris.
Hill: One of the things that I find interesting about this deal is that it's mostly cash. The only reason that surprises me is the way Etsy stock has performed over the past year. I would have thought if they were going to make it a cash and stock deal, they would lean more on the stock side. But the way Josh Silverman has been running this company for the last four years. I don't think I or anyone else is in a place to share how they structured this deal.
Beyers: Well, and let me give you some perspective here on that. Like, we don't know this for sure. But what I like about that, Chris, is you do want to preserve equity not only to honor shareholders, but you may want to preserve equity as a pool to give to the Depop people coming in. Because you want those people to be really excited about being Etsy owners. You don't want them to just say, ""Well, here it is, I got my payout and I'm out."" You don't really want that. I think you want to have some equity for people that you can say the most valuable Depop people who are coming in, you are going to give them equity grants. You need that equity to attract great people, particularly when you are in the business that season. You don't have to keep the equity close to your best, but keep more of it, especially when you've got such a massive cash-generating business, why not?
Hill: It will be interesting to see once this is integrated because I think they're expecting this deal to close in the third quarter of this year, six months from now. What sort of integration on the main Etsy platform are we seeing? Because my hunch is there are some people who have set up shops on Etsy. When they hear about this deal, they're thinking to themselves, ""Oh, fashion, this aligns wonderfully with the shop that I've got, and there might be some cross-marketing opportunities,"" so it's on the list of reasons to do this deal. What this can do for some of the existing sellers on Etsy's platform is somewhere on that list.
Beyers: I think so and I also think it may be the beginning of Etsy taking a look at can we find some brands that fit with what we're trying to accomplish that we can tuck in. There's some power in having more than one brand that can pull you in and then pull you across the offerings that the platform can provide. This is the sort of thing that we've seen at companies like Stitch Fix. Stitch Fix is another one that's trying to bring in some brands and get you to think about, ""Hey, here's our in-house brands and then we also have some of these other partnerships, and so don't you want to do more business with us because we've got clothes you love, and we have brands you love."" I think Etsy is trying to go for something similar here. It's an interesting first step, but really it's just a first step.

2021-06-10 00:00:00+00:00,Intel debates buyout of SiFive to bolster chip technology against Arm -source,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intel-debates-buyout-of-sifive-to-bolster-chip-technology-against-arm-source-2021-06-10,,,"By Stephen Nellis
June 10 (Reuters) - Intel Corp INTC.O is debating a possible offer to buy SiFive Inc, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters, a company closely associated with open-source technology that is challenging the rise of Intel's rival, Arm Ltd.
SiFive, a San Mateo, California-based startup, employs several of the creators of RISC-V, an open-source chip technology that is challenging Arm, the British chip technology firm being acquired by Nvidia Corp NVDA.O for $40 billion. Both Arm and SiFive sell intellectual property such as chip designs to others who ultimately produce the chips.
Intel and SiFive both declined to comment.
Bloomberg on Thursday reported Intel's interest, citing a source saying that the Santa Clara, California-based chipmaker is mulling a $2 billion offer. Intel, along with rivals such as Qualcomm Inc QCOM.O, is already an investor in SiFive, which raised $61 million in a funding round led by Korea's SK Hynix 000660.KS.
SiFive is designing computing cores using the RISC-V architecture. While the underlying architecture for those cores is open-source, the specific core designs themselves can be sold.
Purchasing SiFive could give Intel a library of intellectual property it could use both in its own chips and that it could offer to license to future customers as it works to build a business by opening up its chip factories to outsiders. Intel has already said it plans to license out computing cores based on its own proprietary x86 architecture to customers as part of its contract manufacturing business.
But Intel would also gain a software boost. SiFive is also working on making it easier to program to different kinds of computing chips and last year hired Chris Lattner, a prominent Silicon Valley computer scientist.
Lattner spearheaded the creation of the Swift programming language for Apple Inc AAPL.O that has become the primary way developers write apps for iPhones. More recently, Lattner oversaw programming language teams for Alphabet Inc's GOOGL.O Google Brain and TensorFlow artificial intelligence teams.

2021-06-10 00:00:00+00:00,Intel Is Starting to Look Like Quite the Bargain,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intel-is-starting-to-look-like-quite-the-bargain-2021-06-10,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Intel Corp. (NASDAQ:INTC) has had a rough ride this past year. INTC stock is down 9.45% in the past year, as of June 10. However, now it’s starting to look like something of a bargain.
Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com
A new CEO, Patrick P. Gelsinger, started at the company in February, and his job is to turn things around. Analysts now seem to think that is possible. They are raising their out-year estimates. My new valuation for INTC stock is now $69.84, or 22.3% above today’s price.
Here is how I see that valuation works out.
What Intel Is Worth
A recent bullish Seeking Alpha article on Intel says analysts forecast Intel’s earnings per share (EPS) will hit $5 in 2023. That will be quite a turnaround if it happens.
For example, last year, EPS was $4.94 on a GAAP basis and $5.30 on an adjusted non-GAAP basis. But this year, analysts expect EPS will fall to $4.09, a decline of 17.2% on a GAAP basis.

The 7 Best Growth Stocks to Buy During the Next Dip
I cannot verify the statement that analysts now expect $5 in EPS for 2023. By that, I mean I cannot verify this is the average of analysts for 2023. Right now, the best estimate is $4.79 EPS for 2023, based on the Marketwatch.com analyst estimate page.
This means that INTC stock today, at $57.15, is trading at just 11.9 times 2023 earnings estimates. That is very cheap. For example, there are two ways we can see that this is cheap.
First, Morningstar.com reports that the average price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is 14.58 times earnings on average for the past five years. This implies that INTC stock should be worth around $69.84 (i.e., 14.58 x $4.79). However, keep in mind that this is for earnings two years in the future.
To be intellectually honest, we need to discount those earnings back to the present due to the time value of money. Let’s say that we use a 5% discount rate for a two-year period. That results in a discount factor of 90.7%. So the $4.79 EPS number falls to $4.35 per share (90.7% x $4.79). This is an effective way that investors are compensated for having their money tied up for two years.
So the second method of valuing INTC is to discount its earnings and multiplying it at 14.58 times the lower EPS figure. That results in a price target of $63.42. This is just 11.26% above its price today of $57.15.
What to Do With INTC Stock
This time, I think it is more appropriate to stick with the first valuation method. This is simply because it is not as if Intel now is a super growth company. The company’s earnings by 2023 will simply be rebounding to former heights. In this situation, I don’t think it is necessary to discount those earnings.
Moreover, other analysts tend to agree with me. For example, TipRanks.com reports that the average price target of 31 Wall Street analysts who’ve written about INTC stock is $65.54. This is 14.06% above today’s price and is close to my price target of $69.84 as shown above.
In addition, Yahoo! Finance says that 35 analysts have an average price target of $64.87 and Marketwatch indicates that analysts have a $65.42 average target. In other words, analysts have very close price targets, but they all assume that Intel will rebound from here.
Based on this and the changes that analysts assume the new CEO will make to turn the company around, it appears INTC stock is a good bet. My best guess is that the stock will reach $69.84 sometime in the next year or so, 22.3% over today’s price.

2021-06-10 00:00:00+00:00,Interesting INTC Put And Call Options For July 30th,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/interesting-intc-put-and-call-options-for-july-30th-2021-06-10,,,"Investors in Intel Corp (Symbol: INTC) saw new options begin trading today, for the July 30th expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the INTC options chain for the new July 30th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $56.50 strike price has a current bid of $1.95. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $56.50, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $54.55 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of INTC, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $57.34/share today.
Because the $56.50 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 100%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 3.45% return on the cash commitment, or 25.19% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Intel Corp, and highlighting in green where the $56.50 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $58.50 strike price has a current bid of $1.93. If an investor was to purchase shares of INTC stock at the current price level of $57.34/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $58.50. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 5.39% if the stock gets called away at the July 30th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if INTC shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Intel Corp, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing INTC's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $58.50 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $58.50 strike represents an approximate 2% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 3.37% boost of extra return to the investor, or 24.57% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.
Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $57.34) to be 38%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.
