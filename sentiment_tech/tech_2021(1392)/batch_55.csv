In general, dividends are not always predictable, following the ups and downs of company profits over time. Therefore, a good first due diligence step in forming an expectation of annual yield going forward, is looking at the history above, for a sense of stability over time. This can help in judging whether the most recent dividends from these companies are likely to continue. If they do continue, the current estimated yields on annualized basis would be 4.27% for Verizon Communications Inc, 1.59% for Brady Corp, and 0.47% for Marvell Technology Group Ltd.
In Tuesday trading, Verizon Communications Inc shares are currently down about 0.1%, Brady Corp shares are trading flat, and Marvell Technology Group Ltd shares are down about 0.6% on the day.

This video was recorded on March 29, 2021.
Chris Hill: It's Monday, March 29th, welcome to the MarketFoolery. I'm Chris Hill, with me today, Jason Moser. Good to see you.
Jason Moser: Good to see you. How was your weekend?
Hill: My weekend was good.
Moser: Yeah?
Hill: My weekend was good, looking to ease into spring break here.
Moser: Beautiful weather.
Hill: We're going to talk about semiconductors. But we're going to start with, I don't know where to begin. This is a complicated story [laughs]. Let me start there. This is a complicated story and there are, I think, ripple effects for us as individual investors. Let's start with the context that over the last six months, shares of Discovery Communications (NASDAQ: DISCA) and ViacomCBS (NASDAQ: VIAC) have done quite well. They'd been bid up, I think they've roughly doubled over the last six months. Over the past week however, both of those stocks have been cut in half due to forced selling by the firm that had been buying it up. I will also add that today shares of Credit Suisse are down 15% because they said they face a highly significant and material hit to first quarter results, after an unspecified fund had defaulted on margin calls to Credit Suisse and other banks. This is a firm I'd never heard of until today. I think a lot of people had not heard of it until today. Archegos or Archegos Capital Management.
Moser: I think it might be Archegos but anyway.
Hill: Archegos, there you go. The third way, Archegos Capital Management. This is a family office and that's not a quaint term that is an official designation. Apparently, they'd just been amassing all of this stock and reportedly had ownership stakes of both Discovery and Viacom north of 10%. That was not disclosed because they did not have to disclose it. Now we've got two of the most exciting words in investing, and that's margin call [laughs]. There are a lot of different ways we could go with this. Start wherever you like.
Moser: I mean, there are a lot of things at play here into your point. Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank, Credit Suisse. There are a number of banks that served as brokers. Let's go with Archegos. I may be wrong, but I'm just going to stick with that, at least to be consistent. That ultimately meant that they were the banks that processed trades and lent cash and securities to this fund. I think it was something, I mean, this was a highly leveraged fund. I think they were managing somewhere in the neighborhood of $10 billion or something like that, but had $30 billion worth of exposure due to short positions and in margin and whatnot. There are a lot of different ways we can go with this. Ultimately what I was thinking about this all morning, there's so much to unpeel here that I feel like it lent itself very well to a David Letterman style of top 10 list. You remember back in the day of the Letterman show, the top 10 list?
Hill: Absolutely.
Moser: Yeah, that is iconic. To me this is just a great opportunity for a David Letterman style top 10 list. Let's go ahead and jump into the top 10 lessons learned from the Archegos Capital's failure or demise. Lesson No. 10, leverage is dangerous. Lesson No. 9, learn to think for yourself. Lesson No. 8, if something doesn't look like it makes sense, maybe it doesn't. Lesson No. 7, sometimes the road less traveled, is less traveled for a reason. Lesson No. 6, hey Chris, guess what? Fundamentals actually matter. [laughs] Lesson No. 5, don't short, it's not worth it. Lesson No. 4, there are greater forces at play in the market that we'll never be fully or even partly privy to. Lesson No. 3, diversification matters, you should do it. Lesson No. 2, there are some things we just can't foresee and know as investors, it's always a leap of faith, but that is not the reason to invest, you simply have to go in with that context, with that assumption already in place. It's why we invest, the way we do. Lesson No. 1, from Archegos Capital's demise here. Chris, you ready? If someone gives you the chance to get in on the ground floor with Bill Hwang's next fund, maybe just take a pass. [laughs]
Hill: Well done, sir.
Moser: Well, thank you. I spent a few minutes putting that together and while that was a lot of fun, I really do feel like all of those lessons really do come into play here. It's interesting in regard to that idea, there are some things we just don't know and we can't really foresee. There's a lot of stuff going on, there are a lot of forces at play in the market that we just don't really have insight to. I think part of this is tied to the way some of these trades were set up via swaps. I think swaps gave Mr. Hwang some anonymity in this regard, which is why ultimately, those ownership stakes that you mentioned earlier, were I guess either never disclosed or they didn't have to be disclosed. I think he held those types of states in a number of different companies. Ultimately, like you said, shares of ViacomCBS, and Discovery a year today, going into after the close last Friday, they were up 161%, 157% respectively a year today. When you look at the fundamentals of those businesses, that is a very big head-scratcher. Now we're starting to really understand exactly what's been going on.
Hill: For individual investors, it's totally reasonable to imagine a scenario where people look at the rise of streaming over the past year. We saw it with Netflix, we've certainly seen it with Disney+, and to varying degrees of success, HBO Max, Peacock, etc. You can imagine a scenario where individual investors look at Discovery Communications, ViacomCBS and say, ''Hey if I just want to bet on all the horses in this race, I'm going to buy some shares of each one of these,'' and then in some cases they look at the rise of those last two stocks and think, ''Okay, maybe I'm late, but this thing appears to be doing nothing but go straight up.'' They bought it two weeks ago. Now they're sitting on significant losses as a result of that on paper. I did an interview last week, where the host of the show was asking me about everything that we've seen play out with Reddit and WallStreetBets and GameStop and that sort of thing. He asked me, do you think we're going to see some regulatory overhaul? I prefaced my answer by saying, I'm not a lawyer, but on the surface there, I'm not really seeing where the necessary changes need to be made. I could see it being made with this, because in this situation and I have to credit CNBC because I thought their coverage this morning was particularly informative in terms of laying the groundwork of what's really going on here and the family office designation.
This is essentially a private fund and when the Dodd-Frank law was passed, apparently, family offices heavily lobbied Congress not to include them in significant SEC registration and regulatory approvals and all that sort of thing. A big part of their argument was, look, these are family offices. These are private funds, these are conservatively managed and therefore they don't need to be a part of this. Well, now, you're looking at anywhere between 5,000 and 10,000 of these funds around the world managing in excess collectively of $6 trillion.
Moser: Yeah.
Hill: The ripple effect for individual investors is real. This is a situation where I could see this being revisited because it's not just mom-and-pop investors who bought shares of ViacomCBS, and Discovery Communications. I'm pretty sure the people at Credit Suisse are not happy about what's happening. We'll see where it goes from here. But for the moment anyway, the damage appears to have been contained.
Moser: I think you're right. I think just like anything, you work within the rules that you're given and whether it's a game or whether it's taxes, or whether it is, in this case investing in the financial markets. I'd like to believe that this is probably just one bad apple, but my suspicion is that given the number of funds out there with this designation, it's not the only one trying to use the rules to its advantage. That conservatively managed descriptor there is important because I think you could argue that this fund was not conservatively managed. Perhaps it was in Mr. Hwang's eye's. I think most of us would disagree. The question regarding swaps and anonymity. We live in an age now where information is available with the snap of a finger and I think that as time goes on, as technology continues to level the playing field for investors to me, it only makes sense that we see a trend toward more transparency as opposed to the other way around. But I reckon time will tell.
Hill: Our email address is marketfoolery@fool.com. We got a question from Seth Thompson. He writes, 'As you might know, there's a serious shortage of semiconductors in the world right now. I've been researching Nvidia, AMD, Intel, and a few other companies involved in the industry. But I would love to hear which companies you think have the best chance to deliver strong results during this time of extreme semiconductor demand, and do you think the current shortage will have any effect on the way the market moves over the next few quarters. I'll just take that second one first. Yes. [laughs] Yes. All you have to do is look at any news out of the automotive industry and how, crippled is probably too strong a word, but compromised, I think, is a good word to describe the automotive industry with the way that they do their supply chains. The ripple effect of the semiconductor shortage is really compromising automotives.
Moser: Yeah. Much like the [laughs] traffic jam in the Suez Canal. This is a traffic jam of a different sort, but clearly, it's something that's having a material impact on a lot of businesses, a lot of markets. It's not going to be something that remedies itself anytime in the immediate near future. I'm glad you referred to the automotive market because I think that's one where a lot of people just don't even really give it a second thought. But if you think the way cars are today, you're going to see anywhere from upwards of 50 semiconductors in a vehicle these days. Think about that. These are just computers on wheels at this point, and so for one car to have that much exposure to technology, you can see what just any little crimp in supply could do. It just plays out in virtually everything we do now given this move toward everything in our lives being digital and tech-related, the market opportunities, and Internet of Things, 5G roll. There are just so many tailwinds in regard to technology and really the semiconductor industry is a crucial part of it. To see what's going on, it's understandable why it's happening, it's good to know that it is a temporary thing, it's not something that is going to last forever, but it is something that is going to be around for a little while longer. I like that the companies pointed out there by Louis, in Nvidia, in AMD, in Intel, I think they all provide some interesting and different looks. Nvidia being clearly named at the top of mind for its graphics capabilities, and then AMD, a stalwart of the industry that probably a lot of people haven't really thought about a whole heck of a lot lately, but they've got that acquisition for Xilinx that's getting ready to close. Intel making a big pivot.
That Foundry news, I think, was pretty fascinating and we'll have to wait and see how that ultimately plays out to see if that was a good decision or a bad one. I like those ideas. This is certainly something that I follow in the 5G service that I run here at work, so I enjoy it a lot. They're definitely a lot of companies that come into play here beyond just those Louis, and some to keep in mind, companies that I've enjoyed following, one of them is Qorvo. The ticker there is QRVO. But Qorvo, this is not all that it does, but it has a specific focus on ultrawideband technology or UWB, and that's basically short-range radio technology. It's used to move large quantities of digital data over short distances. It's known for delivering superior location accuracy, and security, and latency compared to other short-range technologies. It's not the only company that focuses on the UWB opportunity, but it is one member of a small club and they made an acquisition here a little while back, a company called Decawave, a $375 million acquisition to give them more presence in that space. Qorvo management on the most recentearnings call they did make mention of the supply chain constraints. It's not something you can just remedy as an individual company, you have to just weather the storm, so to speak. It may keep a lid on growth here in the next couple of quarters but that growth will ultimately flow through.
They do have a big customer in Apple, but that oftentimes can be a very good thing, particularly as you've established that relationship over a long period of time. Qorvo, I think, is one to keep an eye on with a focus on that UWB technology. Another one that I feel like over the past five-plus years has really flown under a lot of radars, and for a good reason it's been pretty stagnant, thanks to saturation in the smartphone market, is Qualcomm. A name I'm sure probably everybody out there is familiar with at this point, but Qualcomm has just a tremendous business on both the chip side and its technology side. It's got a valuable IP portfolio and really generates a lot of operating income just over licensing the technology that it has in its portfolio, I think somewhere in the neighborhood of 140,000 plus patents in their IP portfolio that really give them just, it feels like, a presence in virtually every device that we own. Again, they absolutely made note of the shortage on their most recent call. Again, they see a very similar timeline to what was described by Qorvo.
Then, finally one that it's a sleeper I think for a lot of folks, and again, I think a lot of this has to do with the fact that it really hasn't grown over the last several years, and a lot of that is for the same reasons as something like a Qualcomm, but Marvell Technology. The ticker for Marvell is MRVL, and Qualcomm is QCOM. But Marvell Technology is a semiconductor company that focuses on high-performance data infrastructure products, and the markets it focuses on are automotive carrier, data center, and enterprise. For Marvell, they've been more or less stagnant over the last several years, but they've been investing all the way and I think that's been held against them a little bit here. When I say investing, I mean investments in R&D have been around 35% of revenue on average each year since 2016, so that I think has crimped profitability for the business. But they have made a lot of investments in this 5G roll out and they are seeing a lot of demand for it now. Management did note on the most recent call this shortage and some of the reasons for it, understanding part of it is COVID-19, part of it as this just growing role of tech in our lives and whatnot. But from their perspective, Marvell keeps a pretty concentrated customer base, but they have seen with their customer base that this is going to be something where it's more delayed, those customers aren't able to go somewhere else, it's simply more or less a timing thing.
Then I think with Marvell, they've also got this acquisition of Inphi, which is getting ready to close as well. Inphi is a company that focuses on helping move that data within the data center and outside of the data center. I think that that acquisition of the Inphi is going to give them a nice little boost to that overall market opportunity that they pursue. To my mind, I think Marvell is actually a little bit of a coiled spring going on here. I wouldn't be surprised at all to see Marvell have a great upcoming five years here. But there's a few names in the space beyond what you mentioned there, Louis, I think it's a tremendous opportunity that we're going to watch play out here over the next several years and I'm going to enjoy following it.
Hill: Thank you for reminding me. It was a great email. It was also a little confusing in the fact that up in the header it said his name was Seth and then he signed it Louis.
Moser: [laughs] Oh, yeah.
Hill: We're just going to go with both.
Moser: I'm going with Louis because I didn't even hear Seth. I just saw Louis and I thought, ""Okay."" But, yeah, [laughs] either one, thanks for the email either way. [laughs]
Hill: That's happened a few times over the years.
Moser: Sure. [laughs]
Hill: It's like the pronunciation of Archegos.
Moser: Yeah, exactly.
Hill: I think I pronounced it three different ways, so hopefully one of those three is correct.
Moser: It's whatever you want it to be, big guy, whatever you want it to be.
Hill: Jason Moser, great job from you. Thanks for being here.
Moser: Thanks, Hill.

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.

2021-03-25 00:00:00+00:00,Interesting MRVL Put And Call Options For May 7th,MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/interesting-mrvl-put-and-call-options-for-may-7th-2021-03-25,,,"Investors in Marvell Technology Group Ltd (Symbol: MRVL) saw new options become available today, for the May 7th expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the MRVL options chain for the new May 7th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $41.00 strike price has a current bid of 94 cents. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $41.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $40.06 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of MRVL, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $44.63/share today.
Because the $41.00 strike represents an approximate 8% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 73%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 2.29% return on the cash commitment, or 19.46% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Marvell Technology Group Ltd, and highlighting in green where the $41.00 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $45.00 strike price has a current bid of 42 cents. If an investor was to purchase shares of MRVL stock at the current price level of $44.63/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $45.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 1.77% if the stock gets called away at the May 7th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if MRVL shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Marvell Technology Group Ltd, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing MRVL's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $45.00 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $45.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 49%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 0.94% boost of extra return to the investor, or 7.99% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.
The implied volatility in the put contract example is 85%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 79%.
Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $44.63) to be 46%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

Thanks to the sell-off in tech stocks that has sent the broader market into a tailspin, the chipmaker has failed to carry over its impressive 2020 momentum into 2021 even though its business has stepped on the gas.
MRVL data by YCharts
But investors looking to buy a 5G and cloud computing play on the cheap shouldn't miss this opportunity as Marvell has a lot going for it, and the company's latest earnings report sparked optimism. Let's take a look.

Marvell Technology Group is about to get better this year
Marvell had a solid fiscal 2021, which ended in late January, with its revenue growing 10% over the prior year to $2.97 billion. Adjusted net income jumped a whopping 41% to $627.4 million. Marvell's results exceeded its own expectations for the fiscal fourth quarter, with the company's revenue of $798 million landing $13 million ahead of the midpoint of its guidance thanks to a strong showing in the networking business.
Marvell management pointed out on the latest earnings conference call that the company's ""growth initiatives in 5G, cloud, and automotive drove results in these key end markets, which, collectively, more than doubled in revenue from the prior year to represent more than 25% of fiscal-year 2021 revenue.""
These markets are about to drive stronger growth for Marvell, as evident from the chipmaker's guidance for the current quarter. Marvell expects $800 million in revenue this quarter at the midpoint of its guidance, which would translate into a 15% year-over-year increase. What's more, Marvell expects its non-GAAP gross margin to increase 700 basis points to 63.5% this quarter.
The improved margin profile and higher revenue will push Marvell's adjusted earnings to $0.27 per share at the midpoint of its guidance, up from the year-ago period's adjusted net income of $0.18 per share. For comparison, Marvell delivered 11% year-over-year revenue growth last quarter.
This acceleration in Marvell's growth isn't surprising as the markets it operates in are expected to get better in 2021. Marvell's 5G revenue, for instance, has grown sequentially for six quarters in a row, and the momentum looks all set to continue thanks to new deployments and customer ramps.
Fujitsu, for instance, will be deploying Marvell's baseband processors in 5G base stations. Samsung and Nokia are the other key companies playing a crucial role in driving Marvell's 5G business higher. For instance, the chipmaker says that it has won ""additional content"" at Nokia that will add to the existing production ramp at that customer.
These 5G base station wins are great news for Marvell Technology and the demand for these chips can keep growing at a tremendous pace in the long run as the global base station market is expected to clock a compound annual growth rate of 32% through 2028.
Meanwhile, Marvell's automotive business is also stepping on the gas thanks to the growing usage of Ethernet connectivity in vehicles. The segment's revenue ""crossed into the double-digit million run rate"" last quarter, according to management, and things are expected to get much better this year on the back of new design wins and content expansion at existing OEMs (original equipment manufacturers). In fact, the chipmaker expects fiscal 2022 to be a ""breakout year for this business.""
Don't miss this buying opportunity
Marvell Technology's networking business is on a roll. The segment accounted for 55% of the company's business last quarter and its revenue increased 24% year over year, after accounting for the divestment of the Wi-Fi business that was sold in December 2019. This business could keep getting better this fiscal year as Marvell's existing catalysts become stronger and new ones -- such as the automotive ramp -- join the fray.
Not surprisingly, analysts expect Marvell's revenue to grow a high-teen percentage this year. That would be a big improvement over last year's growth, and also give the company's bottom line a nice boost. In fact, the chipmaker's earnings are expected to clock impressive growth over the next couple of years.

2021-03-11 00:00:00+00:00,Interesting MRVL Put And Call Options For April 30th,MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/interesting-mrvl-put-and-call-options-for-april-30th-2021-03-11,,,"Investors in Marvell Technology Group Ltd (Symbol: MRVL) saw new options become available today, for the April 30th expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the MRVL options chain for the new April 30th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $45.00 strike price has a current bid of 71 cents. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $45.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $44.29 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of MRVL, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $45.75/share today.
Because the $45.00 strike represents an approximate 2% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 57%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 1.58% return on the cash commitment, or 11.53% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Marvell Technology Group Ltd, and highlighting in green where the $45.00 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $50.00 strike price has a current bid of 44 cents. If an investor was to purchase shares of MRVL stock at the current price level of $45.75/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $50.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 10.25% if the stock gets called away at the April 30th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if MRVL shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Marvell Technology Group Ltd, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing MRVL's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $50.00 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $50.00 strike represents an approximate 9% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 64%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 0.96% boost of extra return to the investor, or 7.03% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.
The implied volatility in the put contract example is 87%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 98%.
Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $45.75) to be 52%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

2021-03-11 00:00:00+00:00,These 3 Mega-Cap Stocks Got Too Cheap for No Good Reason,MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/these-3-mega-cap-stocks-got-too-cheap-for-no-good-reason-2021-03-11,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
The price action on Wall Street has been nutty. Often this brings about some crazy good opportunities. The indices stumbled a bit of late, and the bulk of the pain was in the Nasdaq. Great mega-cap stocks just simply fell off a cliff, and without warning. Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) to name two fell 25% and 40% respectively from their highs. They both bounced hard this week and that’s the point of today’s opportunity.
You can’t keep great stocks down for no reason. The markets will have to crash for quality companies will rise again. Passive investing will come back to the drinking fountain every time. Up until a few months ago, these big-cap tech stocks were the wild growth ones. Now it’s the bunch making the rounds on Reddit. The Russell 2000 has a bunch of them like GameStop (NYSE:GME), AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC), and Novavax (NASDAQ:NVAX). Just yesterday GME spiked 40%, then crashed 50% and then rallied back 60%. All this in mere hours, so they definitely now own that moniker.
These large dips in mega-cap stocks were gifts for anyone looking for upside opportunities. They say they don’t ring bells, but one look at the NVDA or Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) charts and you just pounced. By Monday, my list of tickers that alerted me for entry points was more than 50. Today I will share three of them with an important caveat.
7 Stocks to Buy That Are Cheering for March Madness
Even as volatility remains 27% above its average, the indices are still near records. That alone is not reason to short, but it definitely suggests caution. Regardless of how great the upside opportunity is in mega-cap stocks, it has to work within the market. They cannot rally on their own. Because of that, I lower my conviction a notch or two. The companies are:
Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX)
Take-two Interactive (NASDAQ:TTWO)
Marvell Technology (NASDAQ:MRVL)
Mega-Cap Stocks to Buy: Netflix (NFLX)
Source: Charts by TradingView
Netflix stock continues to be out-of-favor of late. After the jubilation of its earnings report, it has failed to recapture momentum. This week it fell as much as 17% from the January high. Now it sits inside important support zones that should hold up. I wrote about this about a month ago suggesting that the dip to these levels are buying opportunities. This is my follow-up to confirm that buying Netflix stock at these levels makes sense.
The underlying assumption is that the markets in general are on solid footing. The bears will need to work extremely hard to break through these levels. Any subsequent dips from here into $480 will find buyers lurking. Technically losing the support would generate a new bearish leg lower. If that happens, investor should be ready to expect another $50 of pain. This would bring Netflix back to last June’s breakout zone.
The fundamental metrics are not going to help support the stock-price action. Netflix is not cheap. However I contend that its price-to-sales (P/S) of 9 is very reasonable. This is in line with Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and just above Apple. Having a low P/S means that the stock holders have realistic expectations. They are not likely to be afraid of bearish stents.
My thesis is that it should meander higher and test $550 per share in the next two months. The streaming trend is still in its exponential phase. Case in point, Disney (NYSE:DIS) reported this week reaching more than 100 million subscribers. While this sounds like a threat to Netflix, it is not. It validates NFLX’s outlook. The migration from cord to no cord is still in its infancy. Theglobal marketis massive, so the upside is big enough to sustain all providers.
Take-Two Interactive (TTWO)
Source: Charts by TradingView
Take-Two stock has been under fire having lost more than 20% since the highs a month ago. The business is undergoing important changes so it’s going through a rough patch. The last earnings report was not stellar but the assets they own and operate are. I bet its fans and users are calm enough to sit through the transition.
Within the mediocre results there was an important statistic in the sales mix. Subtle improvements like recurring consumer spending increased 57%. The more exciting part is that it accounted more than 60% of the total revenue.  This is a big step in the right direction, in my estimation.
Patient investors should see upside from TTWO stock. The weekly chart suggests that it merely reverted to the mean. This is normal price action after a large rally. Post-pandemic, the company rallied more than 100%. Giving back half of it is acceptable and does not break the company. The stock will find footing soon, even though it’s not going to be a hard floor. Meanwhile, investors should be ready to see another 5% drop if they lose Mondays lows.
Selling puts below $140 is a viable alternative to buying shares outright. Otherwise, investors should use stop losses to avoid riding it down much further. It is important to note that if the rally comes, it will face resistance levels. The first is at $175 per share and another just $10 above that.
7 Stocks to Buy That Are Cheering for March Madness
Fundamentally, value is not likely to provide much help. It has a 40 price-earnings ratio, which is not cheap. The saving grace is that the P/S is under 6 and that is solid. Surprise upside may come from too far left sources. The first is once the mania over GME stock dies, more gaming funds will come back to gaming stocks. The other is the ubiquity of 5G will open more opportunities for gamers on many platforms. Streaming should be faster in many more aspects of life because of it. This fits well within the logic that the problem is temporary as the company adjusts and adapts.
Marvell (MRVL)
Source: Charts by TradingView
My third pick today is the longest shot of them all. With a $29 billion market cap, it’s a tiny mega-cap but it plays among them. Chip stocks are now massive and this one could be, too. Therein lies the idea of owning it for the long term. Marvell is not a young company but in reality I consider it to be one. Just like Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU) has been around for eons, only recently the world came into their arenas. Finally the current trends fit their business models perfectly.
MRVL stock has been under fire lately, down 30% from its highs at one point. Since then it has rebounded a bit but will face resistance as it approaches $46 per share. My thesis today is that owning it for the long term makes sense. The whole world is going digital, and totally connected. These guys have the stuff that we will need to make that happen. I’m not sure if this is the bottom, but it’s close. With a P/S ratio of 10 I’m confident it’s not bloated.
The recent drop accelerated after the earnings report and that’s on management. They delivered boring results and very muted forecasts. To make matters worse, they did it during a time when investors were already hating on tech stock. When popular stocks like Tesla are down 7% a day, they’re not likely to step up to buy MRVL.
Technically, it needs to hold the recent lows or it will open the door for more selling. This is where investors need to decide if they want to stop out or not. My guess is that the bottom will hold, and if it doesn’t, there is more support at $36 per share. This could turn out to be a swing-trade opportunity back to $50. Otherwise, it’s a long-term investment to set new highs in the next two years. Here again it will benefit it too will benefit from the launch of a 5G cycle.

2021-03-07 00:00:00+00:00,These 2 Growth Stocks Are Great Bargains Right Now,MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/these-2-growth-stocks-are-great-bargains-right-now-2021-03-07,,,"Technology stocks have pulled back sharply of late on concerns of overvaluation and rising inflation. The tech-heavy NASDAQ-100 Technology Sector Index has seen almost all its 2021 gains wiped out in recent weeks as investors have panicked and scrambled to book profits.
However, savvy investors should look for buying opportunities in such a scenario. That's because the market is known to correct substantially every 16 months on an average before shooting higher, and buying solid companies at great valuations during such a phase could lead to impressive long-term gains.
^NDXT data by YCharts.
Cirrus Logic (NASDAQ: CRUS) and Marvell Technology Group (NASDAQ: MRVL) are two stocks worth buying right now, as they are not just cheap but are also enjoying terrific growth on the financial front. Let's see why these tech stocks deserve your attention.
1. Apple could supercharge Cirrus Logic once again in 2021
The success of Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL) iPhone 12 lineup has given audio-chip supplier Cirrus Logic a big shot in the arm. The chipmaker recorded terrific sales and earnings growth last quarter as iPhone 12 demand exceeded expectations, helping Cirrus beat the higher end of its own revenue guidance range.
Apple accounted for 87% of Cirrus Logic's revenue last quarter. That's going to be a tailwind for the chipmaker in this era of 5G smartphones, which Apple is expected to dominate. There have been reports that Apple plans to substantially increase iPhone production in the first half of 2021 to satisfy the huge end-market demand.
And now, the latest supply chain gossip indicates that the 2021 iPhone model could be produced in bigger numbers than the iPhone 12. Daniel Ives of Wedbush estimates that Apple could place an initial order of 100 million units for the rumored iPhone 13, which would be a nice jump over the iPhone 12's initial build orders of 80 million units.
Image source: Getty Images.
This suggests that Apple could be on track for multi-year growth in iPhone shipments. The tech giant is expected to ship close to 250 million units this year, and the stronger initial build estimate of this year's devices indicates that 2022 could be a better year. For comparison, Apple shipped 206 million iPhones last year, according to IDC.
Cirrus is one of the best bets to take advantage of this growth given its close ties with Apple. In fact, the potential success of Apple's 5G-enabled iPhones is already being factored into Cirrus' future earnings performance.
CRUS EPS Estimates for Current Fiscal Year data by YCharts.
Analysts have hiked their earnings expectations this year, and that's not surprising given the way the new iPhones are dominating in the 5G space. That's why investors looking to buy a hot 5G stock at a cheap valuation shouldn't miss Cirrus Logic. The stock is trading at just 23 times trailing earnings, while a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of less than 16 means that big earnings growth is in the cards.
It is worth noting that Cirrus shares have rarely been this cheap over the past couple of years. The stock had an average P/E ratio of 42 in 2019 and 32 in 2020, making it an ideal bet for investors hunting for a mix of value and growth during this stock market correction.
2. Marvell Technology is switching into a higher gear
Marvell Technology Group stock trades at less than 21 times trailing earnings versus a five-year average multiple of over 43. This makes Marvell a great stock to buy right now because its revenue and earnings growth are about to switch into a higher gear, as evident from the company's latest results.
Marvell finished fiscal 2021 with $2.97 billion in revenue, up 10% from the prior year. Adjusted full-year earnings increased to $0.92 per share from $0.66 in fiscal 2020. The company's top line jumped 11% year over year in Q4 of fiscal 2021, while earnings rose from $0.17 per share a year ago to $0.29 last quarter.
Marvell's guidance suggests that it will step on the gas in the new fiscal year. The company anticipates $0.27 per share in adjusted earnings on $800 million in revenue this quarter, according to the midpoint of its guidance range. That would translate into revenue growth of over 15%, and a 50% increase in earnings per share compared to the prior-year period.
Analysts expect Marvell to sustain this impressive momentum for the remainder of the year, ending fiscal 2022 with 17% revenue growth and earnings of $1.38 per share. What's more, these numbers are expected to get better in the next fiscal year as well, with Marvell forecast to clock strong double-digit revenue and earnings increments.
The good part is that Marvell looks capable of achieving higher growth rates this year thanks to the businesses it is operating in. The company's networking segment, which produced 55% of total revenue last quarter, is benefiting from the rollout of 5G wireless networks and the growing demand for cloud computing.
The networking business recorded 22% revenue growth last year. It could do better this year thanks to Marvell's relationships with key original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) rolling out 5G network infrastructure. Nokia, for instance, is one of the companies using Marvell's 5G chips. It is expected to use more of the latter's content this year, as CEO Matt Murphy said on the latest earnings conference call:
And then we have our second customer, Nokia, which, this year, will be our first full year -- not even a full year. It's ramping this year into production with our baseband product. It will be a full year in '22. And then we have additional content with that customer, which was all publicly announced last year, that will start to phase in after that.
Marvell expects additional content from its other networking customer as well, probably pointing toward Samsung, which is procuring multiple generations of 5G baseband processors from the chipmaker.
In all, Marvell Technology has a lot going for it thanks to secular tailwinds in the networking business. Throw in an attractive valuation, and it becomes easy to see why Marvell Technology is a beaten-down stock worth buying right now, as its fortunes could turn around sooner than later.

2021-03-06 00:00:00+00:00,Analysts Have Made A Financial Statement On Marvell Technology Group Ltd.'s (NASDAQ:MRVL) Yearly Report,MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/analysts-have-made-a-financial-statement-on-marvell-technology-group-ltd.s-nasdaq%3Amrvl,,,"It's been a mediocre week for Marvell Technology Group Ltd. (NASDAQ:MRVL) shareholders, with the stock dropping 14% to US$41.51 in the week since its latest full-year results. The statutory results were mixed overall, with revenues of US$3.0b in line with analyst forecasts, but losses of US$0.41 per share, some 3.5% larger than the analysts were predicting. Earnings are an important time for investors, as they can track a company's performance, look at what the analysts are forecasting for next year, and see if there's been a change in sentiment towards the company. So we gathered the latest post-earnings forecasts to see what estimates suggest is in store for next year.
NasdaqGS:MRVL Earnings and Revenue Growth March 6th 2021
Taking into account the latest results, the most recent consensus for Marvell Technology Group from 26 analysts is for revenues of US$3.49b in 2022 which, if met, would be a solid 18% increase on its sales over the past 12 months. Earnings are expected to improve, with Marvell Technology Group forecast to report a statutory profit of US$0.37 per share. Before this earnings report, the analysts had been forecasting revenues of US$3.46b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$0.41 in 2022. The analysts seem to have become a little more negative on the business after the latest results, given the minor downgrade to their earnings per share numbers for next year.
The consensus price target held steady at US$52.92, with the analysts seemingly voting that their lower forecast earnings are not expected to lead to a lower stock price in the foreseeable future. That's not the only conclusion we can draw from this data however, as some investors also like to consider the spread in estimates when evaluating analyst price targets. Currently, the most bullish analyst values Marvell Technology Group at US$64.00 per share, while the most bearish prices it at US$35.00. As you can see, analysts are not all in agreement on the stock's future, but the range of estimates is still reasonably narrow, which could suggest that the outcome is not totally unpredictable.
Taking a look at the bigger picture now, one of the ways we can understand these forecasts is to see how they compare to both past performance and industry growth estimates. It's clear from the latest estimates that Marvell Technology Group's rate of growth is expected to accelerate meaningfully, with the forecast 18% annualised revenue growth to the end of 2022 noticeably faster than its historical growth of 4.8% p.a. over the past five years. By contrast, our data suggests that other companies (with analyst coverage) in a similar industry are forecast to grow their revenue at 8.3% per year. Factoring in the forecast acceleration in revenue, it's pretty clear that Marvell Technology Group is expected to grow much faster than its industry.
The Bottom Line
The most important thing to take away is that the analysts downgraded their earnings per share estimates, showing that there has been a clear decline in sentiment following these results. Happily, there were no major changes to revenue forecasts, with the business still expected to grow faster than the wider industry. There was no real change to the consensus price target, suggesting that the intrinsic value of the business has not undergone any major changes with the latest estimates.
With that in mind, we wouldn't be too quick to come to a conclusion on Marvell Technology Group. Long-term earnings power is much more important than next year's profits. We have forecasts for Marvell Technology Group going out to 2026, and you can see them free on our platform here.

2021-03-04 00:00:00+00:00,Implied MMLG Analyst Target Price: $27,MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/implied-mmlg-analyst-target-price%3A-%2427-2021-03-04,,,"Looking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at ETF Channel, we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. For the First Trust Multi-Manager Large Growth ETF (Symbol: MMLG), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $27.13 per unit.
With MMLG trading at a recent price near $23.99 per unit, that means that analysts see 13.07% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of MMLG's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are Marvell Technology Group Ltd (Symbol: MRVL), Snowflake Inc (Symbol: SNOW), and NIKE Inc (Symbol: NKE). Although MRVL has traded at a recent price of $45.56/share, the average analyst target is 15.92% higher at $52.81/share. Similarly, SNOW has 15.84% upside from the recent share price of $247.03 if the average analyst target price of $286.17/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting NKE to reach a target price of $155.24/share, which is 15.63% above the recent price of $134.26. Below is a twelve month price history chart comparing the stock performance of MRVL, SNOW, and NKE:
Below is a summary table of the current analyst target prices discussed above:
NAME SYMBOL RECENT PRICE AVG. ANALYST 12-MO. TARGET % UPSIDE TO TARGET
First Trust Multi-Manager Large Growth ETF MMLG $23.99 $27.13 13.07%
Marvell Technology Group Ltd MRVL $45.56 $52.81 15.92%
Snowflake Inc SNOW $247.03 $286.17 15.84%
NIKE Inc NKE $134.26 $155.24 15.63%
Are analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past. These are questions that require further investor research.

2021-03-04 00:00:00+00:00,MRVL April 23rd Options Begin Trading,MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/mrvl-april-23rd-options-begin-trading-2021-03-04,,,"Investors in Marvell Technology Group Ltd (Symbol: MRVL) saw new options become available today, for the April 23rd expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the MRVL options chain for the new April 23rd contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $41.50 strike price has a current bid of 68 cents. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $41.50, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $40.82 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of MRVL, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $41.96/share today.
Because the $41.50 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 56%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 1.64% return on the cash commitment, or 11.97% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Marvell Technology Group Ltd, and highlighting in green where the $41.50 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $43.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.50. If an investor was to purchase shares of MRVL stock at the current price level of $41.96/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $43.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 6.05% if the stock gets called away at the April 23rd expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if MRVL shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Marvell Technology Group Ltd, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing MRVL's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $43.00 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $43.00 strike represents an approximate 2% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 3.57% boost of extra return to the investor, or 26.12% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.
The implied volatility in the put contract example above is 84%.
Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $41.96) to be 53%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

2021-03-04 00:00:00+00:00,Marvell Drops 6% After 1Q Outlook; Street Says Buy,MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/marvell-drops-6-after-1q-outlook-street-says-buy-2021-03-04,,,"Shares of Marvell Technology Group fell 6% in extended market trading on March 3 after the semiconductor company issued financial guidance for 1Q FY22 and quarterly earnings came in line with analysts' estimates.
Marvell (MRVL) expects revenues of $800 million in 1Q while non-GAAP diluted earnings per share (EPS) are forecasted to be between $0.23 to $0.31 per share. Consensus estimates were for revenues of $787 million and diluted EPS of $0.27 in 1Q. The 1Q outlook takes into account export restrictions on some Chinese customers by the US government and the uncertainty due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
The company reported net revenues of $798 million in 4Q, up by 11.2% year-on-year that exceeded the midpoint of its guidance provided in the preceding quarter and topped analysts’ estimates of $794.3 million. Non-GAAP diluted EPS came in at $0.29 and in line with analysts' estimates. (See Marvell Technology stock analysis on TipRanks)
Marvell CEO Matt Murphy said, “Marvell ended fiscal year 2021 on a strong note with fourth quarter revenue exceeding the mid-point of guidance. We delivered outstanding fiscal year 2021 performance, with robust revenue growth of 10%, led by our networking business which grew 22% driven by strong 5G and Cloud product ramps.”
“We are excited about the numerous opportunities ahead in fiscal 2022. We anticipate strong growth in the first quarter of fiscal 2022, projecting revenue to grow approximately 15% year on year at the mid-point of guidance,” Murphy added.
Following the earnings results, Oppenheimer analyst Rick Schafer reiterated a Buy and a price target of $60 on the stock. Schafer said in a note to investors, ""We see storage off seasonally in F1Q but likely up at least 10% this year. Auto presents additional upside optionality. Supply constraints should ease going forward but likely linger through CY21.""
""Channel (~25% of sales) inventories remain below target (2.5 weeks) and delinquencies high, though the sole-sourced nature of MRVL's business likely sees demand pushed forward vs. lost...Given a strong play in 5G, cloud, and auto, we see MRVL positioned for sustained outsized growth,"" Schafer added.
The rest of the Street is bullish on the stock with a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 11 Buys and 1 Hold. The average analyst price target of $57.83 implies around 27% upside potential to current levels.

With that, I'll turn the call over to Matt for his comments on our performance. Matt?
Matt Murphy -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Ashish, and good afternoon, everyone. Let me start with a recap of Marvell's highlights for fiscal-year 2021. Our GAAP revenue was $2.97 billion. GAAP gross margin was 50.1%, and GAAP loss per diluted share was $0.41.
On a non-GAAP basis, our gross margin was 63.3%, and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was $0.92. Our consolidated revenue grew 10% year on year, led by our networking business, which grew 22% year on year. Revenue growth, combined with strong operating leverage from our business model, enabled non-GAAP EPS to grow 39% year on year. I am very pleased with our outstanding performance during what has been an otherwise challenging year.
Our growth initiatives in 5G, cloud and automotive drove results in these key end markets, which, collectively, more than doubled in revenue from the prior year to represent more than 25% of fiscal-year 2021 revenue. We are really pleased with the performance of Avera and Aquantia, who both delivered revenue above our expectations. We successfully completed the integration of both businesses and overachieved on our synergy targets. We also made great strides with our technology platform, announcing the jump to five nanometer, and along with it, the industry's first 112-gig SerDes for cloud data center infrastructure.
This move was a direct result of our multiyear strategic shift to focus on data infrastructure and brings our process node cadence to the cutting edge. The power of our five-nanometer platform and the benefits it provides for customers is evident in our opportunity funnel which has grown significantly since we adopted this new node. The activity level on five nanometer continues to accelerate, and we have already secured multiple leading-edge design wins, each meaningful from a revenue perspective. Our advanced technology is also a key enabler of our custom ASIC offering, which has continued to gain momentum, particularly in cloud.
Following on from the design win we announced last quarter, activity levels continue to increase, and we are now involved in advanced discussions with multiple hyperscale data center customers. Our ability to offer customization, coupled with Marvell's leading standard product IP, has proven to be highly compelling to cloud customers. Given its strategic importance, let me provide some more detail on the evolution of the custom ASIC model, bringing to light some of the key trends that make the opportunity so compelling. Traditionally, the primary customer base for custom ASICs has been large-system OEMs whose core business is developing hardware to sell as a product.
These customers design their own system hardware and build unique technology into the hardware itself through custom chip development to differentiate their products. We do much of the chip design directly and work with a semiconductor partner to license IP and manage the physical layout in front and back-end manufacturing. Today, in addition to these system customers, hyperscale data center operators are also designing their own silicon, and I'm often asked if this trend is good or bad for Marvell. We believe this trend is very good for us as we believe we are ideally positioned to help them solve their unique challenges.
Their core business is the cloud service they provide, not the hardware itself. They are building custom hardware because they need incredibly efficient and optimized infrastructure. As a result, they are looking for a semiconductor collaboration that goes well beyond the traditional custom ASIC model and allows them to leverage IP that the silicon partner already has available. The design is typically done in true partnership with the customer focusing on the portions proprietary to their use cases and Marvell bringing our own unique compute, security, networking and storage IP to the table.
Therefore, the end solution is a semi-custom design, which represents the best of both worlds and provides a faster time to market. Because these engagements use our IP, we believe this leads to a more strategic and valuable relationship with these key customers. In addition, compute is becoming increasingly important in this market as hyperscalers are looking to move beyond standard x86 servers and integrate custom ARM-based compute solutions into their architecture. As this trend accelerates, Marvell should be an even more important partner.
Our long history in successfully developing and delivering multiple generations of highly complex, multi-core, ARM-based processors, including server processors, is unique in the industry. Marvell is emerging as an ideal partner for these customers, and our recent cloud engagements involve deep engineering collaboration on all key aspects of design, including chip architecture, memory density, high-speed SerDes integration, advanced packaging, power optimization and flexible processor implementation. Now let me move on to our quarterly results and expectations. Revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 was $798 million, $13 million above the midpoint of guidance, growing 6% sequentially and 11% year over year.
Adjusted for the divestiture of Wi-Fi, year-on-year revenue growth was even greater at 15%. Our GAAP income per diluted share was $0.02. Our non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was $0.29, growing 16% sequentially and 71% year over year. As expected, supply constraints limited our ability to fully meet the growing demand for our networking products.
We also saw strong demand for our storage products, which drove the upside in revenue relative to the midpoint of our guidance. Although these industrywide supply shortages are now well known, I expect that they may still be a topic of particular interest during our Q&A session. So in anticipation of your questions, let me provide as much detail as I can for you now. As you are aware, despite or perhaps more accurately due to the impact from COVID-19, demand has grown significantly across a range of semiconductor end markets as data infrastructure has become even more critical to the world's economy.
However, the supply chain was not completely prepared for the surge in demand and needs time to increase capacity. While we are confident that the industry will respond to these challenges, we anticipate a supply gap for at least through fiscal 2022. Lead times have extended across the board. We are seeing shortages for multilayer complex substrates, IC packaging capacity and fab constraints in certain technology nodes important for our products.
From our vantage point, the increase in demand we are experiencing for our 5G, cloud and auto products appears closely tied to the long-term secular growth drivers present in these end markets. This, combined with the sole source nature of most of our design wins, would suggest that most of the demand we are not able to satisfy in the near term is not perishable. Marvell is collaborating even more closely with our customers to manage demand forecast over an extended time horizon, and our operations team is continuing to drive our suppliers to match supply appropriately to mitigate impacts and minimize disruptions. In addition, we are taking extraordinary measures, including securing capacity in advance, over much longer-than-typical time periods.
And we are working with customers to get their assistance in helping absorb some of the incremental costs associated with prioritizing their continuity of supply. Let's now discuss our two businesses in more detail. First, in our networking business, revenue during the fourth quarter was $439 million, consistent with our outlook of being flattish to the prior quarter. Year-on-year growth remained robust with revenue growing 24% compared to the fourth quarter fiscal 2020 results, adjusted for the divestiture of Wi-Fi.
The year-on-year growth in networking was led by our 5G and cloud businesses. In addition, revenue from our Ethernet switch and PHY portfolio grew significantly as new design wins started to ramp. Let me provide some color on sequential revenue movements in networking. In 5G, we delivered our sixth straight quarter of sequential revenue growth.
This growth was driven by standard and semi-custom product shipments to Samsung and Nokia, partially offset by a decline in 5G ASICs as deployments in China take a pause. Looking past the typical lumpy nature of individual regional rollouts, 5G infrastructure deployments are expected to continue to strengthen worldwide. As an example, the U.S. recently concluded the first phase of the C-band spectrum auction.
This was the highest grossing spectrum auction ever held in the U.S. with gross proceeds exceeding $80 billion. A record level of interest is a clear indicator of the potential revenue opportunities carriers expect from 5G technology. Other regions around the world are also opening up spectrum for 5G services, and wireless industry experts expect deployments to gather strength later this year.
We launched our open RAN platform in December 2020 and are gaining traction in the marketplace. For example, we recently announced that we are joining the Evenstar program, and we'll be working with Facebook connectivity to provide a 5G open RAN distributed unit design. This design will be based on our leading OCTEON Fusion baseband processors and ARM-based OCTEON multi-core DPUs. Evenstar DU design will enable a new generation of RAN suppliers to deliver high-performance, cost-optimized, interoperable DU products to the rapidly expanding open RAN ecosystem.
We recently announced that Fujitsu will be using our industry-leading OCTEON Fusion baseband processors in its new 5G base stations and also plan to engage with us on open RAN distributed unit products. They are the second 5G regional customer I referenced last quarter. In cloud networking, we benefited from strong customer demand in the fourth quarter for our smartNIC DPUs, while the cloud ASIC declined, as expected. Looking forward, we expect to continue benefiting from the secular growth in cloud capex on semiconductor solutions for data processing.
Turning to our automotive business. Quarterly revenues crossed into the double-digit million run rate, driven by the ramp of multiple Ethernet design wins in model year 2021 vehicles. Engagements are expanding as additional large OEMs and bookings have continued to strengthen. We believe that fiscal 2022 is shaping up to be a breakout year for this business.
The fourth quarter was robust for our Ethernet switch and PHY business with product ramps at multiple customers. The design wins we won over the last couple of years are now starting to ramp, and we expect these will contribute higher levels of revenue as we progress into fiscal 2022. Let me now discuss the outlook for the first quarter of fiscal 2022 for our networking business. Reflecting strong demand, despite continued supply constraints, we project revenues to grow close to 10% on a sequential basis and continued strong year-on-year growth exceeding 20%.
We expect this growth to be broad-based, led by our cloud DPUs, standard and semi-custom 5G solutions, automotive products and Ethernet networking solutions, partially offset by softness in 5G ASICs. Turning now to our storage business. Storage revenue for the fourth quarter was better than expected across all product lines, growing 18% sequentially to $326 million. This was a very strong quarter for our storage business with 10% year-on-year growth, driven by our custom SSD controller and cloud HDD products.
I'm very pleased with the tremendous progress we have made over the last few years in enabling high-capacity nearline HDDs, which are critical for cloud customers. We have extended our long-standing relationship with Toshiba, and we recently announced that our controllers and preamps are powering their new 18-terabyte cloud-scale HDDs. Toshiba's 18-terabyte products deliver industry-leading data storage capacity by utilizing MAMR technology and advanced signal processing developed in close partnership with Marvell. The close coupling of Marvell's rechannel and preamplifier IP enables leading-edge features and HDD capacity to extend Toshiba's position in the cloud data center market.
Let me now provide some additional color on storage revenue on a sequential basis. In the fourth quarter, our custom SSD controller revenue benefited from the ongoing ramp at a Tier 1 OEM, as well as the initial ramp at a major cloud customer. In HDDs, demand was strong across multiple end markets, including enterprise, smart video, retail and client, and our business benefited from aggregate HDD unit TAM growth of about 10% sequentially. Our revenue from cloud HDDs also grew on strong customer demand for our products.
In our fiber channel business, demand recovered significantly from the COVID-19 impacts earlier in the year. Our operations team was able to increase supply to help our OEMs restock and deliver more product to their customers. Looking to the first quarter of fiscal 2022, we project a seasonal decline in storage controller demand. In addition, after last quarter's inventory replenishment by customers, we expect a more than seasonal decline in fiber channel demand.
As a result, after a very strong fourth quarter, we expect our storage revenue to decline in the low teens sequentially on a percentage basis. However, we expect a continued year-on-year growth of over 10% in the first quarter. In closing, needless to say, last year was a very challenging period as we adjusted to operating in the presence of a pandemic. It was almost exactly a year ago today when shelter-in-place policies were coming into effect and we're in the midst of taking action to protect our 5,000-plus employees and an extended support team of contractors and suppliers.
None of us really knew how the year would evolve or how the pandemic would impact our productivity or the demand for our products and technology. I can now look back and applaud a strong performance by the Marvell team in the face of adversity: incredible program execution, record design win achievement, stronger customer relationships, double-digit revenue growth and significant margin expansion. I'm very proud of our employees, and I would like to thank them for their collective efforts in positioning Marvell to emerge even stronger from the pandemic. We ended fiscal 2021 on a strong note, and we are kicking off fiscal 2022 with solid growth expectations, guiding revenue at the midpoint for the first quarter to grow 15% year on year, despite ongoing supply challenges.
We expect strong year-on-year growth from both our networking and storage businesses in the first quarter. Non-GAAP EPS at the midpoint for the first quarter is now -- is projected to grow by 50% year on year, demonstrating the operating leverage in our business model. In fiscal 2022, we expect revenue growth from custom SSD controllers, preamplifiers, automotive Ethernet and enterprise networking, in addition to our expanding 5G and cloud businesses, which is still early in their growth cycles. Our team is also focused on closing key design wins from the large funnel of five nanometer and cloud engagements I discussed earlier.
We are getting closer to completing the Inphi transaction. And as part of integration planning, we recently concluded a series of joint strategic planning sessions. The conclusion of these meetings, our teams walked away more excited than ever about the depth of technology and the level of talent across the combined company. The addition of Inphi broadens the opportunity set for the combined company, and this will be a key factor in setting future investment priorities.
As a reminder, the closing of the Inphi transaction remains subject to obtaining shareholder and regulatory approvals and satisfying other closing conditions. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jean for more detail on our recent results and outlook.
Jean Hu -- Chief Financial Officer
Thanks, Matt, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with a review of our financial results for the fourth quarter and then provide our current outlook for the first quarter of fiscal 2022. Revenue in the fourth quarter was $798 million, $13 million above the midpoint of our guidance. Networking represented 55% of our revenue, and storage contributing 41%.
Revenue from other accounted for 4% of our revenue. GAAP gross margin was 52.8%. Non-GAAP gross margin was 63.9% of revenue, both consistent with our guidance. GAAP operating expenses were $423 million and include the cost of share-based compensation expenses, amortization of acquired intangible assets, legal segments and acquisition and divestiture-related costs.
Non-GAAP operating expense were $283 million, just above midpoint, due to slightly higher project costs. GAAP operating loss was $2 million. Non-GAAP operating profit was $226 million or 28.4% of revenue. For the fourth quarter, GAAP income per diluted share was $0.02.
Non-GAAP income per diluted share was $0.29. Now turning to our balance sheet. During the quarter, cash flow from operations was $158 million. We returned $40 million to shareholders through dividend payment.
During the quarter, we paid down $150 million of our term loan and exit the quarter with $748 million in cash and cash equivalents and total debt outstanding of $1.2 billion. Our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 0.5 times on a trailing 12-month basis. We have temporarily suspended our share repurchase program due to the pending acquisition of Inphi. For the full fiscal year of 2021, we returned a total of $186 million to shareholders through $161 million in dividends and $25 million in share repurchases.
In addition, we paid down $250 million of our term loan. During fiscal 2021, we also generated strong cash flow from operations of $817 million. Turning to our guidance. For the first quarter of fiscal 2022, we are forecasting revenue to be in the range of $800 million, plus or minus 5%.
We expect our GAAP gross margin will be approximately 52.5%. We project our non-GAAP gross margin will be approximately 63.5%. We project our GAAP operating expense to be approximately $391 million. We anticipate our non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $300 million.
We expect our non-GAAP tax rate of 5%. We expect our basic weighted average share outstanding will be 677 million, and our diluted weighted average share outstanding will be 619 million. As a result, we anticipate GAAP earnings per share in the range of a loss of $0.05 per share on the low end to an income of $0.05 per diluted share on the high end. We expect non-GAAP income per diluted share in the range of $0.23 to $0.31.
Finally, two housekeeping points. As a reminder, our GAAP EPS is calculated using basic weighted average shares outstanding when there's GAAP net loss, and they're calculated using diluted weighted average shares outstanding when there is GAAP net income. Non-GAAP EPS is calculated using diluted weighted average shares outstanding. In terms of expenses, you should expect us to continue to invest in our long-term growth with disciplined resource allocation.
We expect our operating expense growth to be well below our revenue growth. Our opex increase year over year will be primarily due to employee merit increase and the normal inflation on items such as EDA 2. Our outlook for operating expense in the first quarter reflects the seasonal increase in payroll taxes. This seasonal effect is expected to dissipate in the second quarter, offset by a partial quarter of merit increase.
The full impact from merit increase will be present in the third quarter. By the time we exit the fiscal year, we estimate our non-GAAP operating expense in the fourth quarter will increase in the range of 3% to 4% on a year-over-year basis. Operator, please open the line and announce Q&A questions. Thank you.
Questions & Answers:

Operator
Certainly. [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Harlan Sur from J.P. Morgan. Your question, please.
Harlan Sur -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst
Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. Appreciate the commentary on supply constraints. And I'm not asking the team to endorse higher revenues in the second half of the year, but I would expect China 5G spend to come back in the second half.
5G outside of China remains strong. Sony is going to double their PS5 shipments this year, and then you have continued momentum in cloud. But if the backlog supported higher revenues in the second half, let's say, 10% higher versus the $800 million in April, is the team confident that you can support quarter-on-quarter revenue growth through the second half? Or do you think that that will be a challenge, just given the tight wafer substrate and assembly and test capacity constraints?
Matt Murphy -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Sure. Thanks, Harlan. Yeah. No.
I think you highlighted some of the growth drivers. So just a few comments. I think the first is we are -- we have been planning for growth in our FY '22. I think we're off to a good start for the year.
If you look at our Q1 guidance alone, it's going to be up 15% year over year versus a year ago. We've got some very strong secular growth drivers. You mentioned 5G, and there's certainly some positive signs, especially for the second half there. We have our cloud business, which is also growing on a secular basis, as well as our new product ramps.
And actually, we also have automotive, which is really off to a good start this year, and we see that continuing. So we've got that as a tailwind behind us. I'd say we've been able to drive growth, even if you look at FY '21, pretty consistently. We've been growing each quarter, quarter over quarter and year over year.
Q4, we were able to actually exceed guidance and make up -- service some of the demand that was there. So that was a positive side. I think -- so I think the message is we've been delivering well. There's been a new sort of increased surge, and that's really where we're focused is working with our supply chain partners to be able to capture that upside above and beyond the growth rate that we've already been achieving.
So bottom-line answer to your question is I'm very confident that we can grow revenue in the second half based on the capacity that we've secured and worked hard with our supply chain partners to put in place. And we're also going to look to see if there's upside opportunity to pursue that as well. And that's not only for this year. But as I look even into our FY '23, we're starting to work with our supply chain partners there as well to really give them advanced notice because we see those trends like 5G, cloud and automotive being even stronger in the out-years with new products ramping, new customers coming online.
And we're pretty excited about our future there. So yes, I think we'll be in -- we're working hard on the -- on all fronts.
Harlan Sur -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst
Great. Thank you, Matt.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya from Bank of America. Your question, please.
Vivek Arya -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst
Thanks for taking my question. Matt, when I look back at this earnings season, most semiconductor companies reported and guided to trends well ahead of expectation, right, so much so that investors, right, have often complained about over shipments or pull-in of orders. But when I compare your Q4 and Q1 against expectations, it's been more measured. I'm curious how much of this would you attribute to a different end market mix, right.
How much of this is due to supply constraints? And then more importantly, what changes or gets better the rest of the year so you can start to accelerate your sales growth? Thank you.
Matt Murphy -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Sure. Yeah. Think, Vivek, it's a couple of things. I think, first, it has a lot to do with the end markets that we're in.
I mean, fundamentally, remember, we're one of the only pure-play infrastructure companies, so we don't have consumer demand that's sort of very volatile, maybe good one quarter, maybe not so good in two quarters. We don't have a lot of demand that sort of comes and goes. We tend to -- and this is sort of by design, by the way. The business model that we've put together is to bring together these various end applications and drive consistent and ideally predictable growth.
So while we may not be as flashy in some quarters as certain companies that really have some explosive demand, but then maybe it abates later, we're focused on slow and steady wins today and continuing to execute and grow our company quarter over quarter and year over year. Certainly, there's opportunities out there to secure some upside, and we're working on that. But I think, even if you saw in Q4, for us, we were quite pleased with the overachievement on revenue, and we're very comfortable with the first-quarter guide as well. So I think it's more around we've been one of the faster growers in the last few quarters and also our end-market dynamics.
Ideally, we'll deliver more repeatable and sustainable long-term growth with maybe less quarter-to-quarter variation. That's been the strategy.
Vivek Arya -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst
And anything changed in the second half versus what you have seen in the last two quarters? What gets better from here?
Matt Murphy -- President and Chief Executive Officer
In terms of the demand or the supply?
Vivek Arya -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst
Yeah, on the demand and the market -- end market mix.
Matt Murphy -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Sure. Yeah. Well, I think a couple of things are going on. If you -- as I indicated in my comments earlier with Harlan, we certainly have -- 5G in the second half will continue to accelerate.
We have -- there are new geographies coming online. We believe that the U.S. will -- shows very good prospects for the second half. We believe that China, as well, will go through their digestion phase, and then you have Japan and you have new countries.
Even India is talking about potentially pulling in their spectrum auction. So that's all positive. So we expect that to continue. Our cloud business continues to grow, and we see that continuing, both on a secular basis, as well as new products, including our ASIC storage and our DPUs, which are doing quite well in terms of smartNICs.
Automotive, the same thing. We've got a good ramp going with our calendar -- our model year, sorry, '21 ramps. We've got more to come in model year '22 with additional OEMs coming online, as well as expanded content. And even some of the new automotive, I call it, the new breed of automotive OEMs, the EV-only focused companies, really aggressively adopting our solutions.
So we're positive there. And then we've got custom SSD controllers, both for cloud as well as for our system OEM. And finally, on top of that, our enterprise business has done extremely well if you look at -- which was surprising, but if you look at even our results in last year, that business with our switch and PHY products grew significantly, primarily on our own product cycle, and we also are very optimistic about that as well. So there's a number of good things that are happening in our business, Vivek, both from an end market as well as a product cycle standpoint.
And so as Harlan pointed out, we've got to go, just continue to make sure we've got the right supply profile to meet that, but we're working hard on that.
Vivek Arya -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri from UBS. Your question, please.
Timothy Arcuri -- UBS -- Analyst
Hi, thanks. Matt, I just had a question on the storage business. It was well above seasonal Q4 and a little below seasonal for fiscal Q1. I guess I'm a little surprised that it will be below seasonal for fiscal Q1, while all your customers are talking about controllers being on allocation.
So I guess I wanted to just talk about that. And then I was wondering if maybe you can talk about what sort of you see as normal season in fiscal Q2. I think, typically, it's up like mid-singles. Do you also have flatter tail happening as well? So can you just sort of talk about those two factors?
Matt Murphy -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Sure. Maybe, Jean, I'll have you answer the first part on storage. And then, Tim, I'll have you repeat your question. You broke up a little bit on the second part of it.
But Jean, why don't you go ahead and give us some comments around storage?
Jean Hu -- Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. Hi. On storage side, in Q4, we really had a really strong quarter, and the performance, really, is a combination of our own product cycle and also strong end-market demand across the board. So in HDD and the fiber channel, certainly, we see the demand in nearline, which our business performed really well, and also just broad demand for -- on the client side, too.
On fiber channel, we do see the demand bouncing back and also the customers are restocking because of the supply challenge in the last year has caused a lot of problems in fiber channel. So fiber channel is a little bit lumpy. And then if you look at the Q1, frankly, the storage controller business, when you look at HDD and SSD, they are actually quite seasonal. It's declining quarter over quarter, very consistent with the broad market.
The fiber channel is where it becomes really lumpy. The Q4 performance is pretty good and strong, but the customers also are restocking. So we do see Q1 fiber channel, again, is declining much more than seasonal. But if you look at the overall, in the longer term, fiber channel business actually is quite stable.
So the quarter-over-quarter lumpiness is definitely exaggerated last year by the supply chain constraints. I think you need to repeat your second question because we did not hear it clearly.
Timothy Arcuri -- UBS -- Analyst
Thanks a lot. OK. You can hear me now. So I guess the question was just given all that movement, how you think about what normal seasonal is for fiscal Q2, like it's typically up sort of mid-singles.
Is that the right way to think about it into fiscal Q2? Thanks.
Matt Murphy -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. I think we'll -- I think, Tim, so first of all, I think we're -- we have a -- I don't even know what the new normal is in storage anywhere -- anymore, but there certainly is a seasonality effect to that, but we're not really guiding out that far at this point. What I want to emphasize, though, is that even on the sort of lumpiness of fiber channel, which has definitely started, I think, with the shelter-in-place orders that went into effect earlier in 2020, there's just been a -- it's been a lumpier business than normal, and so it had a very good Q4. And then, obviously, we've guided it down for Q1.
But if you just sort of step back, storage, overall, for Marvell is up 10% year over year in Q1 is what we're guiding. So -- despite some of the lumpiness. And this is a higher sort of beta business than the rest of our businesses. We're still pretty pleased with the trajectory of this business.
And we do expect the fiber channel portion to normalize throughout this year, assuming that there's no more supply chain surprises.
Timothy Arcuri -- UBS -- Analyst
OK, Matt. Thanks much.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Pitzer from Credit Suisse. Your question, please.
John Pitzer -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst
Yeah, good afternoon, guys. Matt, glad to see the 10% sequential growth expected in networking in the April quarter. But I'm kind of curious, when you look back at the January quarter, I'm a little surprised that networking was down sequential. I mean, it was essentially flat, in line with your guide.
But just given the level of delinquencies, did the supply problem get worse? Or is this maybe a function that when you look at the networking business, there's portions that are just tied to campus and enterprise? And then there's sort of the growthy parts of your business. I guess, that the growthy parts grow sequentially, and there was an enterprise overhang. As you look out throughout the balance of the year, how do you think about just a reopening trade around enterprise and the impact it's going to have on your networking business?
Matt Murphy -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. No. I think, as we've said, the supply impacts we've seen have been more pronounced in the networking business. So that has limited our ability to deliver upside, like we want to.
Even then, you got to remember, too, our -- the compare is a little bit tough because we did have a very strong Q3. I mean, you've got to now go back to sort of what are you comparing it to. If you remember, Q3 was up very significantly from our Q2. And then year over year, it was up a ton.
So the flat compare, while we wish we could have done a little better, it's still, on an annual basis, still growing really well. I wouldn't really break out that there was sort of weakness in one or the other. I think we're coming off a big Q3 and then also the 5G was up and enterprise has continued to be up, and we've actually seen, from a year ago, everything growing. So I think it's more of a sequential issue.
And certainly, we're pleased with the Q1, 10% up, and that business continues to do very well for us.
John Pitzer -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst
And then, Matt, just on the cost side, how much are you absorbing versus being able to pass on? Is it material to gross margins? And is that something that sticks around for most of this fiscal year? Or is that something that could reverse itself in the second half?
Jean Hu -- Chief Financial Officer
Hey, John. This is Jean. Yeah, I'll take this question. So definitely, as Matt mentioned earlier, we are working with the customers to share the increased cost.
And the way we're looking at it is our first priority is to really meet customer demand, especially with the increased demand for our product. As far as the gross margin, we are very pleased with our Q4 performance and the Q1 guide. And the Q1 guide, if you look at it, it's primarily driven by mix and we'll continue to improve our gross margin to our target level. We discussed during our investor day, which is 65%.
I think the pace of that improvement is probably different in today's supply constrained environment versus a normal environment because we do want to make sure we meet customers' demand, increase the demand on this current supply constraint situation. So the pace will be a little bit different, not as we expected during our last investor day.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis from Barclays. Your question, please.
Blayne Curtis -- Barclays -- Analyst
Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Just I just want to ask, I know you answered a lot on the storages and said it would be short all year. You did miss some shipments in January, and I thought at the time you were thinking of catching up in April.
So as you look to the guidance of 10% for networking, one, I just wanted to know, you're catching up on some of those January shipments within that 10%. And then I think I heard you say basically everything but 5G ASICs would be up. I was wondering if you could give us any more color as to what the primary drivers of that growth is.
Matt Murphy -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Well, Yeah. No. On the second part, you're right, other than 5G ASICs, which were mostly tied to the China deployments in 5G, which were extremely strong in calendar '20. And we're seeing that digestion now.
Yeah, the rest of it is up, but there's not necessarily a catch-up, per se, in Q1. I mean, we are seeing demand increase. And I think we've -- we see revenue going up, and we see -- so I'd say it's more demand-driven than just, oh, well, we've caught up and now the demand is flat. We actually have a pretty robust demand picture for that particular business, both year on year and sequentially.
Jean Hu -- Chief Financial Officer
And overall, to just add to what Matt said, overall, we continue to have a similar delinquency, right, so it's certainly supply chain constraint.
Blayne Curtis -- Barclays -- Analyst

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse from Evercore. Your question, please.
C.J. Muse -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst
Yeah. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess to clarify, Jean, are you implying opex in fiscal '22 is growing roughly 2.5%? And then I guess for the primary question, Matt, can you discuss your engagement with hyperscale customers? Can you kind of walk us through the initial work on perhaps discrete ASICs and how that kind of relationship is evolving to perhaps more custom solutions across increased areas of processing? Thanks so much.
Jean Hu -- Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. Our opex year over year, you can think about, is around 3%, the typical inflation year over year. We are managing our resource allocation to ensure we continue to invest in all the growth platforms we have. So that's how you can model it.
Matt Murphy -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. C.J., I'll take your other question. So I think the -- if you even go back to our purchase of Avera, there was really two -- we had a thesis there on two fronts. One was to be more relevant in the 5G market and be able to offer full custom design capability, along with the semi-custom that we had developed with our lead customer.
And as you've seen, that's gone really well. The second was that the recognition that in the cloud hyperscale market that more and more of the -- particularly compute-based solutions, were going to go to full custom or even semi-custom but a need to really have a full ASIC capability. And these are -- there's a range of applications, by the way. These things could be anything from AI or ML chips to server-class CPUs to networking products, smartNICs, so there's a variety of applications.
And as I said in my prepared remarks, this trend is here to stay, and we think it's good for us. I think there is a world that, that's post x86 or certainly coexist with it where more and more of the compute and more and more of these solutions are moving to very, very customized products. And we have all the ideal pieces to support that in terms of our process technology, our in-house IPs, like our SerDes, both for short reach and medium and long-reach at the highest frequencies, including 112 gig. And our ability to really partner closely and deeply and be flexible in our business model as well.
And what I mean by that is we can do standard ASICs that are the traditional model you think of. But increasingly, what I'm seeing is the engagements with the cloud companies are really more partnership-oriented where it's solutioning together and it's proposing architectures and proposing four different ways to do something and then coming up with a model that really suits their needs. And so I think sort of our go to market, plus our technology road map and then having all these key pieces, whether it's networking IP, very, very strong compute portfolio with all of our history from the Cavium side and ARM-based processors to security, to storage. And then within PHY coming in, obviously, the optical connectivity.
So I think we're going to -- we can be an ideal partner here, and we think this is going to be a very big opportunity, and it's going to be one that's here to stay.

Hi, guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. Just a clarification then a question. The clarification, just, Jean, usually, you give a little color on what the other segment is going to do.
But the main question for Matt is on the 5G side of things. I think everybody knows the digestion period that's going on in China now, some of the transitions going on geographically and the optimism people have in the second half, but you're really outperforming that -- during that transition period that we have right now and it sounds like you'll continue to in the back half. So I guess what I'm getting at is when you think about your company-specific drivers, separated from the market as a whole, improving in the back half, do you think that outperformance you're delivering now accelerates or decelerates? And what are the drivers of that performance above and beyond what the end market itself is going to do?
Matt Murphy -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Sure. Why don't I take the 5G question, then Jean, you can comment on other. So yeah, Ross, I think you're right. I mean, we've we performed really well on the cycle.
We had six quarters of sequential revenue growth in 5G, and we were able to power through as new products ramped. And new customers came online when some others maybe felt different paces of digestion. So I think we're pleased with that outperformance in that run. The China, in particular, deployments last year were very large.
And so as you pointed out, I think a number of companies are going through a similar digestion, but we do expect this business to accelerate and continue to outperform for a couple of reasons. I think one is our lead customer has certainly gained momentum in some of the markets that we'll be ramping in the second half, plus in calendar '22. So that's a positive sign. And there's also -- within them, there's programs where we have new sockets where content is also -- it's new content for us.
And then we have our second customer, Nokia, which, this year, will be our first full year -- not even a full year. It's ramping this year into production with our baseband product. It will be a full year in '22. And then we have additional content with that customer, which was all publicly announced last year that will start to phase in after that.
So I think there's -- yeah, there's a number of Marvell -- very specific Marvell drivers with some of the most important companies in this space. And then even looking beyond that horizon, we've got really good traction with our ORAN initiatives. And we're in the mix on a number of very important sockets across all the OEMs that will keep driving growth here. So we feel very good about our 5G position that it can continue to outperform and accelerate going forward.
Jean Hu -- Chief Financial Officer
Yeah, Ross, on the other question, just a reminder, other is largely for our printer business today. And quarter over quarter, it's actually going to be just up a couple of million dollars sequentially.
Ross Seymore -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tore Svanberg from Stifel. Your question, please.
Tore Svanberg -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst
Yes. Thanks. And I'll keep it to the one question. So Matt, you referenced some strategic meetings with Inphi.
I know the deal is not going to close for a few more months. But from those meetings, could you perhaps give us a few examples on how the two companies are combining the IP to go out and target some new opportunities?
Matt Murphy -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. So yeah, let me give you a little background on what we did, how we're thinking about it and maybe some broad brush strokes on the opportunities. Certainly, we're not -- we're still two separate companies, so I think more to come on that, Tore. And some of the opportunities as well, some are pronounced and some are nuanced, but the bottom line is, first of all, Ford and Lloyd, the founder of N5, put together just an incredible team.
I mean, we've now gotten exposure through this process, which was great. Their key engineering leadership, their key product marketing people, their business unit leaders and also same on our side. So it was really a very, very powerful, I'd say, joint meeting where we reviewed all of our various businesses, and we were able to identify a number of exciting areas where we certainly can work together. In general, the technology is obviously very complementary, but we do sit in the same systems.
And certainly, there's things like process road map and customers where we can go in together. So I'd say the net -- and the way we -- the reason we did this is we're really approaching this as a merger with the Inphi team. And so we're going to bring them in, and we're going to look at really the combined company spending and identify jointly the best opportunities to get the highest ROI and drive the best top line growth. And so what we found is we believe this is going to give us an opportunity to allocate some additional spending in some very targeted areas within the Inphi team to actually accelerate some of their ambitions and growth.
And I can tell you from our side and my entire management team, multiple layers down, is very excited about the team coming over and their product lines and their prospects. And I look forward in future meetings to actually start articulating some of these in a lot more detail. But I'd just end it by saying thematically, combined, I think we've become much more important and much more relevant in the cloud hyperscale market than either company would have been independently. And I think, together, given the system-level complexity that these companies are dealing with, the cutting-edge performance they need, the deep sort of real technical and strategic partnerships they're looking for, we believe that this can be as important and strategic a market and probably larger market combined than 5G.
And so I think we're -- our strategy we laid out at the investor day, which was a little bit before Inphi, but certainly was on our mind, which was really think about 5G as this wave of growth that we're seeing right now, the cloud then following that. And certainly, Inphi layering in will accelerate our opportunity there. And then we have a lot more to share at a later date as well on our automotive opportunities, which is starting with Ethernet, but it's now branching out into other aspects of Marvell, including storage and security, compute, ASICs, and some other additional networking type of solutions. So all in all, I think the combined company is going to be very, very relevant in this cloud market, especially.
Tore Svanberg -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst
Thank you for that context.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Rolland from Susquehanna. Your question please.
Christopher Rolland -- Susquehanna International Group -- Analyst
Thanks for the question. Going to the ASIC side of the business, maybe piggybacking on some that have already been asked, but maybe you can talk about where this new design pipeline is coming from? Is it storage? Is it networking? Is it compute? Where are you getting the most traction there? And then as we look out, let's say, five years, Matt, what percent of your business do you think or expect or would like ASICs to be?
Matt Murphy -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. I think -- let me give you the backdrop. So I think the exciting part of our ASIC opportunity, and I would even broaden that to say our broader, I'd call it, advanced technology opportunity, of which ASIC is certainly an important piece. This would be what I would call our five -- just think about our five-nanometer platform as its own potential growth opportunity.
We publicly announced this in August of 2020, but we have been securing designs in this technology as early as end of 2019 type of time frame, early 2020. And so since that time frame, we've grown this design opportunity funnel to be very significant size relative to anything we've seen before on a single sort of process node. And it's very broad, Chris. I think that's sort of the point I want to make.
I think there are -- if you go by market, certainly, there are 5G designs that we've already won and secured as an example there, and there's a large pipeline in front of us as people move from sort of 12-, 14-, 16-nanometer type of products, and they want to go all the way down. There are significant cloud hyperscale opportunities, some of those I mentioned earlier. But also in enterprise, we've had good success in promoting our OCTEON-based CPUs into that market. That would be more of a standard product, by the way, not a custom.
And then even in storage, we've seen some very important customers in the storage market take a leadership role and work directly with us to develop state-of-the-art flash controllers for things like data center and enterprise applications using our five-nanometer technology. So it's -- this is much broader, Chris, than just, oh, well, Marvell has got a five-nanometer thing and they can go offer ASICs with a standard sort of model, and that will generate some revenue. It's really a transformational platform for us, which we're -- we could use for traditional ASICs. But increasingly, we're finding that these custom opportunities that people come and ask us for, several of them have now converted into Marvell products where we're designing the entire product based on a spec.
And designing the product for them rather than -- and then, of course, there's more value that can be captured there. It's a more stickier engagement. And these are all very significant type of opportunities, in particular, in the cloud market. So I hope that's helpful context to sort of broaden it because certainly, we had a view maybe going back to when we bought Avera.
Hey, this will be great. We can have a nice big ASIC business, but it's turned into much more than that. And yes, and we're excited to talk about that in the coming quarters as we close designs and we take advantage of the pipeline that our sales team and our business units have developed, which is extremely strong.
Christopher Rolland -- Susquehanna International Group -- Analyst
And what percent do you think it could be in five years?
Matt Murphy -- President and Chief Executive Officer
That's hard to say. And I think it depends on what you mean, like is it -- how much is ASIC versus how much is semi-custom versus how much is in 5G, but this is clearly a -- this is the future growth of the company. So you should assume these things are multibillion type of opportunities for the whole platform going forward, right? I mean, this is where we're going to be the growth engine of the company. So it's very significant.
These are not nichey one-off designs that we're winning that will kind of be a nice sort of headline news product, this is going to be really the driver of the company's revenue growth. So in aggregate, all of this becomes a very significant portion of our future company revenue.
Christopher Rolland -- Susquehanna International Group -- Analyst
Excellent.
Matt Murphy -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley. Your question, please.
Joe Moore -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst
Great. Thank you. In terms of the constraints, I wonder if you could talk to -- you mentioned substrates as being maybe the biggest factor and then certain geometry wafers, which geometries are those? And then just as a bigger picture aspect to this, it seems like from Marchex, that networking chips in general are tighter than other things, even though there's tightness in graphics and that you have to be able to grow quite a bit. Is there something different with substrates and things like that, where this is affecting the infrastructure businesses more than it's affecting other areas?
Matt Murphy -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. I think on the first question, Joe, it's hard to say. I mean, this is such a dynamic environment, right? We've been reviewing every part of the supply chain as a team for months, right? And we're finding that we solve one issue and then another one seems to appear. And if you even go back to our lastearnings call I remember there were some questions there like, tell me about the supply chain issue and you fast-forward three months and the U.S.
automotive industry is in disarray because they can't get chips, right? So things are moving at a very rapid pace. I will note that we're supplying quite well actually on our automotive products, so don't make that comment with Marvell. That's more of a general one. But we do see point capacity stress with complex substrates, for sure.
We see some of the ""older nodes"" and what I would mean by that is this isn't sort of five, seven-nanometer type of things. These are more going back to, call it, 28 and above, right, that have different pain points that companies are working with. And that's where a lot of this automotive, I think, tends to sit. So it's -- there's not a silver bullet.
It's just going to take a lot of hard work. And even things like -- I think I noted in the last call, things like wire bonders have -- those lead times have stretched. So our OSATs are just having a hard time keeping up. Now they're spending money, and they're certainly adding capacity, and we're engaged in that planning process to make sure we're OK, but that's maybe a little bit more detail on that side.
And then what was your second question?
Joe Moore -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst
Yeah. No. That was basically the question is just, is there something different --
Matt Murphy -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Oh, on the networking chips, yes.
Joe Moore -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst
Yeah. I mean, graphics chips are in short supply, but people are kind of growing 20% faster than they thought and then constrained at that level where it seems like the networking shortages are just as severe. We're hearing about them from your customers, but demand doesn't seem to be on that kind of crazy trajectory.
Matt Murphy -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. It's hard for me to benchmark since we're not in the graphics business. I know that's a little bit of a different scale. But certainly, the complexity level of these products when you look at just the complexity of the substrates alone, I mean, I think the number of layers, if you go to these advanced products in, call it, 14, 16 nanometer and below, have probably doubled in terms of the complexity of the substrates.
And they're just extremely large die. These are thousands of IOs and some of these die are virtually the size of a credit card. So you've just got very low die per wafer, and you got a lot of demand. And it's been difficult for people to keep up.
There's also test constraints that the test times on these things are very long because of the complexity of the product. So there's just -- maybe that's the reason. But I run an analog business and now I run Marvell, but I've never run a graphics business. I don't --
Joe Moore -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst
Yeah. No. I'm just trying to compare and contrast. Just comparing and contrasting.
That's very helpful. Thank you so much.
Matt Murphy -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, you're welcome.

Thank you. And our final question for today comes from the line of Srini Pajjuri from SMBC Nikko. Your question, please.
Srini Pajjuri -- SMBC Nikko Securities -- Analyst
Thanks for squeezing me in. Hey, Jean, I have a question on opex and also on the margins. I guess as you ramp some of this five-nanometer designs and as you engage more in five nanometer, I'm just wondering how you're thinking about opex, if there's going to be more volatility as we go forward? And also, I guess, as we go to second half of this year and beyond, and 5G and ASICs become a bigger portion of your revenue, do you see any further opportunity to improve your gross margins from these levels? Thank you.
Jean Hu -- Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. On opex, right, our team has done excellent job to manage operating expense. But you're right, there are some variabilities quarter over quarter due to the project cost. And also, we are working with our customer together.
Sometimes the customer portion of it may accelerate or push out, so there are variations, but I feel quite comfortable. Look at the overall for fiscal '22, we can manage the opex at the same time investing. So for instance, our Q4, our opex is slightly higher because of project cost, but we'll manage it overall. On the margin side, I think our No.
1 objective is really to meet the demand. We have significant opportunities for the company, and we have increased the demand across all the growth platforms, as Matt mentioned, the 5G, cloud and also automotive. So that's actually our No. 1 objective, and we certainly will continue to improve gross margin and make sure we get the most margin dollars out of our business.
Srini Pajjuri -- SMBC Nikko Securities -- Analyst
Got it. Thanks, Jean.

Tech stocks have been on many investors’ radar again. The first two months of 2021 saw the sector rise to unprecedented highs. It was so impressive that the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite had reached an all-time high last month. The index has since taken a breather along with the broader market. What had fuelled this epic rise in the tech sector? Many companies that thrived in this digital acceleration in the last year were tech companies. With that, tech stocks proliferated in that time span. As the pandemic forced many people to stay at home and businesses to shift online, demand for tech products and services skyrocketed.
You only need to look at top tech stocks like Marvell Technology (NASDAQ: MRVL) and Okta (NASDAQ: OKTA) to see how successful they have become. Both stocks have doubled in valuation in the last year itself. Marvell develops and produces semiconductors and related technology while Okta provides cloud software to companies. Both industries enjoyed explosive growth when more people stayed at home and businesses shifted online. Given all of this, would it still be a good time for investors to jump into tech stocks? I believe so given how many people have already adapted to the pandemic era and given how the conveniences from tech are here to stay. With that in mind, here is a list of top tech stocks to watch in thestock market today

2021-03-01 00:00:00+00:00,This Hot 5G Stock Could Be a Terrific Buy,MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/this-hot-5g-stock-could-be-a-terrific-buy-2021-03-02,,,"Marvell Technology Group (NASDAQ: MRVL) has been in terrific form on the stock market over the past year, with shares of the chipmaker doubling thanks to tailwinds in the networking and storage businesses.
MRVL data by YCharts
Marvell's impressive rally will be put to test on March 3, when the company releases its fourth-quarter results for its fiscal year 2021. Let's see what's expected and look at whether the chipmaker's results and guidance are likely to be strong enough to help it sustain its momentum.
Image source: Getty Images.
Marvell Technology has its work cut out for it
Marvell Technology's third-quarter results disappointed investors in December. The chipmaker's impressive top- and bottom-line growth failed to match Wall Street's expectations as supply constraints affected sales of its networking products.
The fourth-quarter revenue guidance also turned out to be softer than expected. Marvell expects $785 million in revenue (plus or minus 5%) for the recently concluded quarter at the midpoint of its guidance range. That would translate into a year-over-year gain of almost 10%. Analysts are expecting the company to deliver nearly $795 million in revenue.
The consensus earnings estimate of $0.29 per share is in line with the midpoint of Marvell's guidance range of $0.25 to $0.33 per share. It also points toward substantial gains over the prior-year period's figure of $0.17.
Marvell will have to turn in a better-than-expected top-line performance to keep investors in good humor. The Wall Street guidance is certainly within Marvell's reach, as the upper end of its revenue expectation sits at $824 million.
It is also worth noting that the chipmaker may have issued cautious revenue guidance considering the supply constraints it is facing. Marvell had explained on its December 2020 earnings conference call that it is working ""closely with our supply chain partners to alleviate constraints and meet the growing demand from our customers.""
A successful production ramp will be a tailwind for Marvell and help it meet or exceed revenue expectations. Failure to do so could send the stock down, but that could also open an opportunity for savvy investors to buy a top growth stock at an attractive valuation.
Why it makes sense to buy on a dip
Marvell Technology stock trades at 23 times trailing earnings, which seems reasonable considering that the multiple is lower than its five-year average price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 44. A post-earnings dip would make the stock more affordable, and a look at the bigger picture indicates why that may be a buying opportunity.
Marvell supplies chips that are used in two fast-growing verticals -- networking and storage. The networking business -- accounting for 59% of the total revenue -- has been in fine form of late thanks to the growing demand from data centers and 5G wireless networks.
Marvell's networking revenue shot up 35% year over year in the fiscal third quarter. The company is confident of maintaining momentum thanks to a bunch of solid catalysts. For instance, Marvell has been shipping its 5G ASICs (application-specific integrated circuits) to Samsung and started shipments to Nokia last quarter.
Supplier relationships with these two companies bode well for Marvell from a long-term perspective for a couple of reasons. First, the 5G base station market is growing at a terrific pace, which means that demand for ASICs used in these base stations will continue to remain strong. Second, Samsung and Nokia are big players in the global telecom equipment market with a combined market share of nearly 30%, as reported by market research firm Dell'Oro.
Meanwhile, Marvell's cloud business is also gaining impressive traction thanks to its recently launched data processing unit platform that opens another exciting opportunity for the company.
The chipmaker estimates that the 5G and cloud growth drivers discussed above will help it achieve 25% year-over-year revenue growth in the networking segment in the fiscal fourth quarter. However, these markets will drive Marvell's growth beyond just one quarter and strengthen its bottom line over the long run.
MRVL EPS Estimates for Current Fiscal Year data by YCharts
What's more, analysts expect Marvell's revenue to grow at a faster pace of over 16% in the fiscal year that has just begun. That would be a big improvement over the most recent year's estimated top-line growth of 10.5%.
Marvell Technology is about to switch up a gear in the new fiscal year, and it could keep growing at a fast clip thanks to the markets it operates in. That's why buying Marvell's dip in the event of a weaker-than-expected quarterly report would be a smart thing to do.

2021-03-01 00:00:00+00:00,Marvell to supply chips for Facebook-backed 5G effort,MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/marvell-to-supply-chips-for-facebook-backed-5g-effort-2021-03-01,,,"March 1 (Reuters) - Marvell Technology Group Ltd MRVL.O said on Monday its chips will be included in a project from Facebook Inc FB.O designed to make it easier and cheaper to deploy 5G networking equipment.
In the past, telecommunications gear tended to come from a handful of major players such as Nokia NOKIA.HE, Ericsson ERICb.ST and Huawei Technologies Ltd, who supplied everything from software to run the networks to gear for radio towers, along with custom chips inside the gear.
But companies like Facebook, the social networking giant that maintains a business focused on improving internet infrastructure, have pushed for what are called open radio-access networks, which are made up of software and hardware designs that can be mixed and matched and are sometimes free to use. The goal is to lower costs.
Facebook has focused on developing software for the open networks while partnering with hardware companies to come up with designs for hardware. Marvell on Monday said it had partnered with Facebook on a circuit board design for what is known as a ""distributed unit,"" or DU, which sits near the bottom of a cell tower to crunch data coming in through the tower's radio units.
The design will be free for telecommunications firms to use, but contains multiple Marvell processors. The move is aimed at making it easier for telecommunications firms to get networks up and running because the design work is already done, while at the same time helping Marvell sell more chips.
""What we are designing for Facebook is a system that anyone, in the fullness of time, can deploy,"" Raj Singh, executive vice president of the processors business group at Marvell, said in an interview.

Tech stocks are off to a slow start this week. U.S. stocks, in general, were mixed today as market interest rates around the world climbed amid improving recovery hopes and a near-term end to the global pandemic. This latest slump does not mean that the tech sector is crashing. Rather it may be that tech stocks are lagging behind other sectors that are exposed to the traditional economy. These sectors usually benefit from more fiscal stimulus and U.S. lawmakers will debate on Joe Biden’s $1.9 trillion stimulus this week. 
With the U.S. reaching herd immunity possibly by April, this raises the prospects of a post-pandemic boom as businesses may open by then. Due to the effectiveness of the vaccine, U.S. cases have already dropped by over 70% in the last 6 weeks.
How will top tech stocks fare in a post-pandemic world? Given how we have adopted tech so much into our lives in the last 1 year, our dependency on them would be here to stay. Today, we have already gotten used to shopping on Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and have all our entertainment needs on Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX).
