At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the INTC options chain for the new February 2022 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $51.00 strike price has a current bid of $2.14. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $51.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $48.86 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of INTC, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $51.52/share today.
Because the $51.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 4.20% return on the cash commitment, or 35.62% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Intel Corp, and highlighting in green where the $51.00 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $52.00 strike price has a current bid of $2.01. If an investor was to purchase shares of INTC stock at the current price level of $51.52/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $52.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 4.83% if the stock gets called away at the February 2022 expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if INTC shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Intel Corp, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing INTC's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $52.00 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $52.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 52%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 3.90% boost of extra return to the investor, or 33.12% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.
The implied volatility in the call contract example above is 37%.
Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $51.52) to be 32%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

2021-12-23 00:00:00+00:00,"EXCLUSIVE-Italy, Intel intensify talks over $9 billion chip factory, sources say",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/exclusive-italy-intel-intensify-talks-over-%249-billion-chip-factory-sources-say,,,"By Giuseppe Fonte and Giulio Piovaccari
ROME, Dec 23 (Reuters) - Intel and Italy are intensifying talks over investments expected to be worth around 8 billion euros ($9 billion) to build an advanced semiconductor packaging plant, two sources close to the matter told Reuters.
A deal of this size would secure Italy about 10% of the 80 billion euros the U.S. company is looking to spend over the next decade in Europe on cutting-edge manufacturing capacity to help avoid future shortages of semiconductor chips.
Sources had previously told Reuters that the investment size was in a 4 billion to 8 billion euro range.
As part of this plan Germany, the European Union's largest economy, is in the lead to land Intel Corp's INTC.O planned European 'megafab' plant, although France remains in the running, Reuters reported in October.
Intel said it is ""having constructive investment conversations with government leaders in multiple EU countries"" but declined to comment specifically on talks with Italian officials.
""We are encouraged by the many possibilities to support the EU’s digital agenda and 2030 semiconductor ambitions. While current negotiations are ongoing and confidential, we plan to make an announcement as soon as possible,"" the company said in a statement.
Chipmakers are scrambling to boost output after explosive demand for consumer electronics such as smartphones and computers resulting from the work-from-home trend during the COVID-19 pandemic led.
Meanwhile EU countries, where many jobs still rely on industries such as automobile manufacturing, are eager to reduce their dependence on semiconductor supplies from China and the United States after recent supply chain problems.
The proposed Italian factory would be an advanced packaging plant using innovative technologies to weave full chips.
Intel and the Italian government of Prime Minister Mario Draghi are discussing an overall investment of $9 billion over 10 years from when construction begins, the sources said.
Negotiations are complex and Rome wants Intel to clarify its plans for Italy before formalising a package of favourable conditions, especially on jobs and energy costs, they added.
If Rome and Intel clinch a deal, they will then proceed with the choice of a site for the plant, the sources said.
However its Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger earlier this month said he hoped to announce the locations of new chip plants in the United States and Europe early next year.
In April, the Italian government used anti-takeover legislation to block a planned sale of a controlling stake in a local semiconductor equipment maker to China's Shenzhen Invenland Holdings Co Ltd.

2021-12-22 00:00:00+00:00,Intel facing China backlash after Xinjiang statement,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intel-facing-china-backlash-after-xinjiang-statement,,,"SHANGHAI, Dec 23 (Reuters) - U.S. chip maker Intel INTC.O is facing a backlash from China after telling its suppliers not to source products or labour from the northwestern region of Xinjiang.
Intel said it had been ""required to ensure that its supply chain does not use any labour or source goods or services from the Xinjiang region"" following restrictions imposed by ""multiple governments"".
The United States has accused China of widespread human rights abuses in the predominantly Muslim region of Xinjiang, including forced labour. Beijing has repeatedly denied the claims.
The Global Times, a nationalist tabloid run by the ruling Communist Party's People's Daily stable of newspapers, branded Intel's statement as ""absurd"", adding that the company - which earned 26% of its total revenues from China in 2020 - was ""biting the hand that feeds it"".
""What we need to do is to make it increasingly expensive for companies to offend China so their losses outweigh their gains,"" the newspaper said in an editorial.
Netizens also expressed anger at Intel's letter.
On China's Twitter-like Weibo microblog service, singer Karry Wang said he would no longer serve as brand ambassador for Intel, adding in a statement that ""national interests exceed everything"".
Many Weibo users also called on Chinese citizens to boycott Intel, with one posting under the name ""Old Catalan"" saying, ""Must resist, do not buy!""
Multinational companies have come under pressure as they aim to comply with Xinjiang-related trade sanctions while continuing to operate in China, one of their biggest markets.
The Global Times said in its editorial that multinationals ""should be able to endure, properly handle and balance pressure from all parties"".
Intel could not immediately be reached for comment.

HONG KONG, Dec 23 (Reuters) - U.S. chip maker Intel apologised on Thursday to Chinese customers, partners and the public for telling its suppliers not to source products or labour from the region of Xinjiang, following a backlash in China.
The company recently published what it described as an annual letter to suppliers, dated December, that it had been ""required to ensure that its supply chain does not use any labour or source goods or services from the Xinjiang region"", following restrictions imposed by ""multiple governments"".
That letter, on the company's website and in several languages, sparked a backlash in China from state and social media, with calls for a boycott of the company's products.
In a Chinese-language statement on Thursday on its official WeChat account, Intel said that its commitment to avoid supply chains from Xinjiang was an expression of compliance with U.S. law, rather than a statement of its position on the issue.
""We apologise for the trouble caused to our respected Chinese customers, partners and the public. Intel is committed to becoming a trusted technology partner and accelerating joint development with China,"" Intel INTC.O said.
U.N. experts and rights groups estimate more than a million people, mainly Uyghurs and members of other Muslim minorities, have been detained in recent years in a vast system of camps in China's far western region of Xinjiang. China denies abuses in Xinjiang and says its policies there help combat extremism.

*Stock Advisor returns as of December 16, 2021
Nick Sciple: Intel announced plans earlier this week to spin out its Mobileye unit. That's the unit that develops chip systems for self-driving cars. Mobileye was publicly traded until Intel acquired the business for about $15 billion in 2015. Today reports are saying they're seeking a $50 billion valuation for Mobileye. John, what do you make of this news?
John Rosevear: Well, I don't follow Intel itself closely, but I know that Intel has not had a great few years. But on the other hand, Mobileye has gone gangbusters. That $15 billion that Intel paid for them was a hefty premium in 2015. But Mobileye has roughly tripled its revenues since then.
We should back up a bit. Mobileye is an Israeli company led by its co-founder Amnon Shashua, who is one of the smartest people in the world working on what we call machine vision, processing images that cameras pick up, hence Mobileye, the name of the company. They do business with just about every automaker in the world with the exception of Tesla and the possible exception of Toyota. But many, many things. They have made advances in self-driving software. They are working with Nio, the Chinese electric vehicle maker, on self-driving taxis that are coming very soon. A very impressive company. Has moved very quickly.
At the time Intel bought it, it was pretty much the only pure-play self-driving stock. Now, of course, the field is a little more complicated, but I think a $50 billion valuation in the current market given current valuations will be easily reached. Let's put it that way.
Nick Sciple: Where do you put Mobileye in this constellation of, now there's Luminar out there, there's Velodyne? Nvidia, to a certain extent, plays in the self-driving universe. Where does Mobileye fit in there? Would you say they're a leader or a disruptor?
John Rosevear: Well, first of all, they're different from companies like Luminar and Velodyne because they're not making lidar. They're making, essentially, computer chips --processing chips that process the images harvested by cameras, lidar, and so forth, to help the self-driving car or driver-assist brain, computer brain make sense of it all. At this point, they've been around 15 years, I want to say something like that, a while. They weren't a new company when Intel bought them in 2015. At that time, they were already selling vision processing chips to most of the world's automakers. If your car can sense when it's wandering out of lane or anything like that, chances are good that there is a Mobileye chip in that system software. They're vision processing systems on chips. They've gotten a lot more sophisticated since 2015. I think Mobileye remains out in front of this. I don't know if you'd call them an incumbent now. [laughs] They're certainly important to a lot of automakers plans, whether that automaker is Ford or Nio, let's put it that way.
John Rosevear owns Ford. Nick Sciple has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. The Motley Fool owns and recommends Intel, Nio Inc., Nvidia, and Tesla. The Motley Fool recommends the following options: long January 2023 $57.50 calls on Intel and short January 2023 $57.50 puts on Intel. The Motley Fool has a disclosure policy.

Dec 21 (Reuters) - Wall Street's main indexes were set to rise on Tuesday, following a steep selloff in the previous session, as strong quarterly earnings from Nike and a positive forecast from chipmaker Micron helped lift sentiment.
A rapidly spreading Omicron variant of the coronavirus has rattled stock markets around the world, triggering major routs in the final month of the year due to worries about the strain's impact on global economic recovery.
Shares of Nike Inc NKE.N rose 4.0%, leading gains among Dow .DJI components trading premarket. It beat quarterly estimates for profit and revenue, and sounded confident of a letup in supply chain problems in its next fiscal year.
Micron Technology Inc MU.O led gains among chipmakers, with a jump of 8.4%, after it forecast upbeat second-quarter earnings and topped Wall Street expectations for quarterly profit and revenue.
Their positive updates helped allay some concerns about broader supply chain constraints in a high inflation environment, which has become a cause for concern for central banks globally.
Shares of fellow semiconductor makers, including Nvidia Corp NVDA.O, Qualcomm Inc QCOM.O, Intel Corp INTC.O and Advanced Micro Devices Inc AMD.O, rose between 0.7% and 3.0%.
""We got oversold yesterday and we are bouncing back a little bit today. This market is more a dead cat bounce as opposed to this new bull market that is going to rage into 2022. There are just too many concerns,"" said Dennis Dick, a proprietary trader at Bright Trading LLC in Las Vegas.
Mega-cap growth firms, including Tesla Inc TSLA.O, Microsoft Corp MSFT.O, Apple Inc AAPL.O, Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O, Meta Platforms FB.O and Alphabet Inc GOOGL.O, rose between 0.8% and 1.3% after taking a beating on Monday.
Investors have taken a more defensive stance this month, with sectors such as consumer staples .SPLCRS, real estate .SPLRCR and utilities .SPLRCU among top gainers in December.
""For the next year, one thing to consider is the January effect — the buying of beaten down names. What you see right now is tax-selling of all these growth names... That abates after the new year, and sometimes beaten down dogs of 2021 might actually become leaders in 2022,"" Dick said.
At 8:29 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis 1YMcv1 were up 283 points, or 0.81%, S&P 500 e-minis EScv1 were up 40.25 points, or 0.88%, and Nasdaq 100 e-minis NQcv1 were up 169.5 points, or 1.09%.
Travel-related stocks, which fell in the previous session on the prospect of tighter curbs, rose on Tuesday. Delta Air Lines Inc DAL.N added 1.4% to lead gains among U.S. carriers, while Wynn Resorts WYNN.O gained 1.5%.
General Mills Inc GIS.N slipped 4.9% after missing analysts estimates for quarterly profit.

2021-12-20 00:00:00+00:00,Interesting INTC Put And Call Options For July 2022,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/interesting-intc-put-and-call-options-for-july-2022,,,"Investors in Intel Corp (Symbol: INTC) saw new options become available this week, for the July 2022 expiration. One of the key inputs that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 207 days until expiration the newly available contracts represent a potential opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the INTC options chain for the new July 2022 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $47.50 strike price has a current bid of $4.15. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $47.50, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $43.35 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of INTC, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $49.24/share today.
Because the $47.50 strike represents an approximate 4% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 59%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 8.74% return on the cash commitment, or 15.41% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Intel Corp, and highlighting in green where the $47.50 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $50.00 strike price has a current bid of $4.40. If an investor was to purchase shares of INTC stock at the current price level of $49.24/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $50.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 10.48% if the stock gets called away at the July 2022 expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if INTC shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Intel Corp, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing INTC's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $50.00 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $50.00 strike represents an approximate 2% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 50%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 8.94% boost of extra return to the investor, or 15.76% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.
The implied volatility in the put contract example is 36%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 33%.
Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 251 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $49.24) to be 32%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

It turns out that $3 trillion is  a lot of money.
AAPL stock fell almost 4% on Dec. 16 and then another 1.3% in after-hours trading on that day. It opened Dec. 17 at about $17o per share, and it’s changing hands for around $169 per share today.  That’s almost 31 times last year’s earnings and almost 7.5 times analysts’ average fiscal 2022 sales estimate of $385 billion. Apple’s market capitalization is $2.82 trillion.
Long-term investors are not sweating the drop. The shares are up five-fold over the last 5 years. Apple’s stock split 4:1 in 2020 after a 7:1 split in 2014. I last got into the name late in 2018, and despite taking some of my money out of it subsequently,  I still have a 131% gain.
New Catalysts
Unlike high-flying tech stocks such as Cloudflare (NASDAQ:NET), which have been pummeled, Apple is seriously profitable. In its last reported quarter, Apple earned $20.5 billion on sales of $83 billion.  For each $4 of its revenue, nearly $1 hit the company’s bottom line. And its sales jumped 29% year-over-year.

Every new iPhone is an earnings catalyst for Apple, and it has other upbeat drivers. The Apple Watch is still just getting started as a health aid. Apple Glasses are reportedly coming. Apple TV is just starting to ramp up, and the company keeps filing patents that indicate it plans to launch an Apple Car.
Apple is also looking to expand its hardware margins by designing more of its own chips. It has already replaced Intel’s (NASDAQ:INTC) microprocessors with designs based on the ARM platform. Apple is also going to design its own modems, replacing Qualcomm’s (NASDAQ:QCOM) offerings. Now it’s looking to dump the chips of Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS) and Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) as well. 
Apple’s Valuation
Apple is one of the five “Cloud Czars” that dominate the global economy. The others are Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:FB), the company formerly known as Facebook.
Apple, however, has distinguished itself by tying its services closer to its hardware ecosystem. For example, Apple Music, the descendant of iTunes, will soon be integrated into its operating system.
So as investors turn to value stocks and companies that make real stuff, Apple’s shares are climbing relative to its “Cloud Czar” peers. The gap between its market capitalization and that of Microsoft has expanded over the last three months. Amazon and Facebook are both down in that time, and Google is treading water.
Given its growth rate and prospects, Apple is already practically a value stock. The average price-earnings ratio in the S&P 500 is over 29, just slightly below Apple’s price-earnings ratio.
Apple does, however, have problems. With over 147,000 employees, that’s inevitable. There’s a hashtag called #Appletoo  that’s being used to complain about sexual harassment within the company. A woman who organized the movement says she was fired for doing so. And the U.S. Labor Department is reportedly probing the company over “environmental and health safety issues.”
The Bottom Line on AAPL Stock
It makes sense for markets to take a breather as the outlook of the economy shifts.
Inflation and supply chains will be a challenge for Apple, as they will be for every manufacturer.
Apple draws 17% of its sales from China, and China still represents a large part of its supply chain, while Apple’s cooperation with China’s government is increasingly controversial.
But Apple is addressing all of those issues. It’s bringing more of its operations in-house, and it’s slowly merging the operating systems of its phone, tablet and PC.
If Apple is overvalued, everything is overvalued. That may be the case, but there are few better places to be than the stock market.

2021-12-20 00:00:00+00:00,Why Nvidia Stock Dropped Again Today,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-nvidia-stock-dropped-again-today-0,,,"What happened
Semiconductor star Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is tumbling along with the rest of the market this afternoon, down 2% as of 11:45 a.m. ET.
Besides the general effect of coronavirus news, there is also a report that Nvidia could face increased competition from Intel for the most-talented employees in the industry.
Image source: Getty Images.
So what
Taiwan's DigiTimes tech newspaper today confirmed reports by Bloomberg last week that Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) is hiring more semiconductor engineers in order to design more of its chips in-house. Right now, according to DigiTimes, this is more of a threat to companies like Qualcomm, Broadcom, and Skyworks Solutions, rather than Nvidia per se. It does, however, play into a broader trend of Apple bringing the design of ever more kinds of chips in-house. In the long term, that could be bad for Nvidia if it shrinks the market for graphics chips in general.
And now comes a new threat. As TechRadar reported this morning, Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) is moving to fight back against Nvidia's growing dominance of the chip sector, setting aside $2.4 billion in cash and stock grants with which to raise employee salaries in 2022. Across Intel's 110,000-person payroll, that works out to an average of $21,000 per person in pay boosts, TechRadar said. But the money will be targeted toward Intel's best-performing employees, in an effort, as Intel said, to ""win the fierce battle for talent in today's competitive market, while strengthening our execution.""
Now what
Nvidia investors seem a little spooked by Intel's move. But according to TechRadar, the bulk of the pay raises being contemplated will come in the form of stock grants. And with Intel stock up only 9% over the past year, and Nvidia stock up more than 108% -- despite recent weakness -- I suspect rational high-tech workers looking for the best chance of profiting from stock options will still gravitate to Nvidia, and shy away from Intel.

Once a top tech stock, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) has had a rough year. The pandemic has been kind on tech stocks, but competitors haven’t. INTC stock faced massive competition in recent years, and it has led to a decline in the market share.

Intel stock hasn’t moved much in the past year. It was trading at $50 in December 2020 and is at the same level today. In October, I wrote about the stock continuing the downward journey and I think anything below $50 is a good entry point. 
The stock did see a few ups and downs during the year and went as high as $68 in April this year. Intel is a strong company and it is not fair to write it off just yet. The company has a lot planned for the coming year which may take INTC stock higher.
With that in mind, let us take a look at two reasons to bet on the stock.
A New Chip Facility In Malaysia
Intel is all about chips and the chip shortage has been troubling several industries this year. The company is planning to invest billions in a new chip facility in Malaysia with an aim to expand production across the world and alleviate the chip shortage.
7 of the Best Clean Energy Stocks for 2022 to Buy Now
Intel will spend more than $7 billion for the chip packaging and testing factory. The Malaysian factory could start production in 2024 and it could change the future of the company. The management plans to spend around $25 billion to $28 billion on the building of the manufacturing facilities in order to become a larger player in contract manufacturing over the years. 
This is a well-planned and well-timed investment that can generate millions in revenue for Intel. There are huge challenges due to the chip shortage and we can see a rise in global demand for chips. Intel will be able to make the most of this opportunity and cash in on the growing demand.
Mobileye Could Change the Game
Intel plans to take the Mobileye business public next year and this move will allow the company to raise cash for the manufacturing plans. It is expected that the company will announce the public offering mid-next year for a valuation of $50 billion. Intel has adequate cash to manage the business expansion and the company believes that it can handle the expansion strategy without the transition of going public. The company had purchased Mobileye in 2017 for $15.3 billion. 
Mobileye is already a market leader in autonomous driving solutions and expects to deliver 40% more revenue in 2021 as compared to 2020. It is a hidden jewel that Intel has and it could transform the business of the company. The company is making the right move to capitalize on the asset and it will benefit the bottom line.
The Bottom Line on INTC Stock
I believe Intel is already a strong, well-established company and with these two moves, it will be able to handle the chip shortage well. The chip shortage may last beyond 2022 and companies need to rethink their manufacturing strategy to ensure that they do not lose out on the revenue and customers due to the shortage. With the new manufacturing unit in Malaysia, Intel will be able to handle the situation without losing a lot of money. 
INTC stock may not be at the top yet, but the future looks bright and Mobileye could turn out to be more successful than it is today. Do not forget the fact that Intel is a dividend-paying company and as my InvestorPlace colleague Mark Hare writes, Intel could be worth 20% more if it raises the dividend by 5%. 
Considering all the factors, INTC stock looks fairly valued with a strong potential to grow in mid-2022.

2021-12-20 00:00:00+00:00,2 Semiconductor Stocks to Watch During This Decline,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/2-semiconductor-stocks-to-watch-during-this-decline,,,"Today's video focuses on bullish and bearish points for Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD). The stock prices of both companies have taken a hit in the past month. Could this drop be a buying opportunity for semiconductor investors? Here are some highlights from the video.
AMD's third-generation server processor continues to win adoption by giant cloud providers. In November, IBM's (NYSE:IBM) Cloud selected third-generation AMD server processors for a new bare-metal offering. In December, Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) AWS expanded its AMD EPYC processor-based offerings.
In Nvidia's most recent quarter, the company reported 50% revenue growth year over year (YOY). The demand for its graphics cards remains high while channel inventories remain low. Nvidia expects yearly and sequential growth in its gaming and data center products for its upcoming quarter.
On the bearish side, AMD and Nvidia are in intense competition against each other and have other competitors like Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). The demand for chips is still high, but if the market slows down because companies over-order, it could trigger a sell-off in the semiconductor industry. These bearish points are not new for AMD or Nvidia, but they're important to keep in mind.

2021-12-17 00:00:00+00:00,Intel Stock Is Worth Nearly 20% More According to Multiple Metrics,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intel-stock-is-worth-nearly-20-more-according-to-multiple-metrics,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
In my article last week on Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), I said that INTC stock looked like a good buy considering its dividend yield.
Source: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com
My Dec. 13 article, “Intel Could be Worth 20% More If it Raises the Dividend by 5%,” showed that INTC stock is cheap. For example, compared to its historic dividend yield of 2.40%, the stock’s current yield of 2.75% makes it cheaper than the historical yield. In this case, the lower the yield, the higher INTC stock can rise.
For example, right now Intel pays an annual dividend of $1.39 per share. If we divide that number by its historical yield of 2.40%, we get a target price of $57.92 per share. That price is almost 14% higher than today’s price (Dec. 16) of $50.83 per share.
Moreover, I argued that since Intel is likely to raise the quarterly dividend in January 2022, the new target price should be even higher.
7 of the Best Value Stocks for 2022 to Buy Now
For example, a 5% dividend hike to $1.46, divided by 2.40%, the new target price will be $60.83 per share. That is 19.7% over today’s price.
Using Other Historical Metrics
Just to underline that this stock is well below its historic norms, I have decided to take the same comparative approach using other metrics. Let’s start with the historical price-to-sales (P/S) ratio.
For example, Morningstar shows that over the past 5 years the  average INTC stock P/S multiple has been 3.23 times. Remember that, on its own, this number simply means that half the time the P/S ratio has been over this multiple and half of the time it has been lower. We don’t know how long on each side, nor the variance. It just means that the mean market cap has been 3.23 times its sales.
Let’s compare that with the estimate for next year. Analysts forecast sales of $73.72 billion for 2021 and $73.54 billion for 2022. Given that Intel’s market cap of $202.1 billion, this puts its P/S multiple at 2.74 times for 2021 and 2.75 times for 2022.
Therefore, if INTC stock were to rise to a point where it hit its historic norm of 3.23 times sales, that would imply an upside of 17.7% for the stock. This is seen by dividing 3.23 into 2.745 (the midpoint P/S multiple for 2021 and 2022).
This implies INTC stock is worth 17.7% more, or 1.177 times $50.83, or $59.83 per share.
This underscores the result we reached with the historic dividend yield model. We can also look at the multiples from a price-to-cash flow (P/CF)standpoint as well. That metric is a little bit more complicated.
Using Price-to-Cash Flow Model to Value Intel
Morningstar’s valuation tab on Intel indicates that its 5-year historical P/CF multiple has been 7.94 times. We can use that to compare with the existing P/CF multiple for INTC stock.
On Oct. 21 Intel released its earnings for the 9 months ended Sept. 25. Page 9 of that release shows operating cash flow for the 9 months of $24.194 billion. Since sales for the 9 months were $58.496 billion, its cash flow margin was 41.36%.
Using the $73.54 billion sales forecast for 2022, and applying the 41.36% cash flow margin leads to a cash flow estimate of $30.416 billion.
Given that Intel has a market cap of $202.1 billion, the puts INTC stock on a P/CF multiple of just 6.64 times (i.e., $202.1b/$30.4b). This implies that Intel stock sells well below its historic average P/CF multiple of 7.94 times.
For example, if it were to rise to its historic average, the implied upside would be 19.6% higher. This is seen by dividing the 7.94 P/CF ratio by 6.64x.
Bottom Line: What INTC Stock is Worth
So using the price-to-sales model, INTC stock is worth 17.7% more, while using the P/CF model implies a 19.6% upside. And using the historic yield model gives us a 19.7% higher stock price.
The average of all three of these models is a potential gain of 19.0%. That represents a price of $60.49 per share, compared with today’s price of $50.83 per share. This is a very good return for most investors.
Keep in mind that there is no reason why INTC stock couldn’t keep falling and get cheaper relative to its historic norms. However, in the long run, its historic price-to-value metrics tend to act as a tether for a stock. Eventually, the price tends to spring back closer to the average. If that happens within the next year, expect to earn a decent ROI investing in INTC stock.

There was a time when Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) stock was a key blue-chip tech stock. Granted, it’s not like INTC is currently having trouble rubbing two pennies together. Its chips still control 91% of the x86 server central processing units (CPUs) in the market, and 30% of that will be its newest Xeon chip.

But the trouble is that its market share is less than it was last year. And INTC’s chief rival, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), while only owning about 9% of the server market, is gaining ground.
What’s more, INTC stock has suffered from recent supply chain issues getting its laptop CPUs built and shipped, so AMD gained some ground there, as well. But recent numbers look like INTC is at 75.5% market share while AMD sits at 24.5%.
INTC Stocks Real Challenge
When INTC started, it was pretty much a necessity that a chip designer also be a chip maker. There weren’t foundries that could take a chip design and build it. But in recent years, “fabless” chip companies have been the way to go.
7 Dividend Stocks to Buy for 2022 With Dividend Yields Over 5%
No longer do chip companies have to spend money for their own chip making facilities. They can concentrate on designing chips and then send them out for production.
However, this has run into its own set of challenges. Frosty relations between the U.S. and China are now affecting foundries in China and even Taiwan. U.S. chip makers are realizing the benefits of managing the means of production in the U.S. or Europe.
But that changes the cost structures, as well. And INTC needs help from western governments to subsidize moving operations back to the U.S. and Europe.
Yet at the same time, Asia is growing rapidly, which makes having operations in Asia crucial.
Also remember that INTC was late on the mobility boom. It lost leadership in a massive megatrend and has been working extra hard trying to turn its legacy into something dynamic for today and tomorrow.
New Thinking May Help Bring New Opportunities
In February, INTC announced new Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Pat Gelsinger was taking the reins. He is a former INTC employee who left after 30 years in 2009 to eventually serve as CEO of cloud and mobility infrastructure firm VMWare (NYSE:VMW).
He brings some outside ideas into the relatively insular culture and has started by rethinking its foundry business. He’s committed to a $20 billion foundry in Arizona and he wants to attract fabless chip companies as customers.
It was recently announced that INTC is going to have an initial public offering for its automotive chip firm Mobileye in mid-2022. This has many investors excited. The company is focused on smart cars and adds some zip to the legacy business.
But there’s a challenge: can INTC stock deliver the numbers and the growth while making these moves toward the future.
Certainly, its massive server and laptop market shares aren’t going to keep the moat they currently have. We’re in a world that has far too many chip designers out there to think that that’s possible.
So the good news is INTC stock is cheap at its current price of $50.92. And its new leadership is addressing some opportunities and eliminating some concerning legacy challenges.
The bad new is it still has to deliver on this vision. And the longer it takes to turn this ship, the more opportunity it leaves for competitors to run holes into its sides.
For now, given its dominance and its new vision, its current price is a good entry point for long-term growth investors. And its 2.7% dividend is a decent return for your patience for now.

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.

2021-12-15 00:00:00+00:00,Why Nvidia Stock Finally Popped Today,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-nvidia-stock-finally-popped-today,,,"What happened
For five long days, it looked like Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock could do no right -- the share price just kept dropping as investors sought out cheaper ways to play the global semiconductor shortage.
That ended Wednesday morning when traders latched on to some positive commentary from an analyst at KeyBanc. As of 10:40 a.m. ET, Nvidia stock was up a solid 2%.
Image source: Getty Images.
So what
What did KeyBanc analyst John Vinn say to stop the slide? Not a lot, actually -- but apparently, enough.
As StreetInsider.com reports, the bank's ""November cloud instance tracker"" is showing strong demand for cloud computing services (and Nvidia's semiconductors help with those). Specifically, ""instances"" of cloud computing services being used grew by 29% year over year in November, and by 6% in comparison to October. The news was best for Microsoft's (NASDAQ: MSFT) Azure business, and Amazon's (NASDAQ: AMZN) AWS, both of which grew faster than average year over year.
Looking at the chipmakers, KeyBanc was most optimistic about Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD), whose chips largely power Microsoft's Azure, and less so about Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), noting that Intel's processor deployments grew 4% month over month and 22% year over year across all major cloud services providers -- below the averages.
Now what
And Nvidia? That's the strange thing. According to KeyBanc, the semiconductor company's ""instances"" number grew only 25% year over year -- good, but still below average. And Nvidia's growth was only 1% sequentially from October.
In the final analysis, KeyBanc declared these results positive for AMD, ""moderately negative"" for Intel, and only neutral for Nvidia. That wasn't great news, but it seems to have been at least enough to stop the sell-off of Nvidia's shares.

2021-12-15 00:00:00+00:00,3 Things About Nvidia That Smart Investors Know,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-things-about-nvidia-that-smart-investors-know,,,"Most investors likely recognize Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) as the world's largest producer of discrete GPUs. They'll also attribute its recent growth spurt to the secular expansion of the PC gaming and data center markets, and point out that it's trying to buy Arm Holdings -- the world's largest designer of mobile chips -- from SoftBank (OTC: SFTB.Y) for $40 billion.
However, those bullet points only scratch the surface of Nvidia's business. To gain a deeper understanding of this complex chipmaker, we should analyze three finer points that only smarter investors have likely spotted.
Image source: Nvidia.
1. It faces a hidden competitor in the data center market
The bullish thesis for Nvidia in the data center market is easy to grasp. CPUs use scalar processing, which process one piece of data at a time, while GPUs use vector processing, which processes a wide range of integers and floating point numbers simultaneously.
CPUs can't process machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) tasks as efficiently as GPUs, so big data center operators have been installing more of Nvidia's GPUs to handle those tasks. That's why Nvidia's data center revenue rose 55% year-over-year last quarter and accounted for 41% of its top line.
But Nvidia faces a hidden competitor in this high-growth market: Graphcore, a private U.K. chipmaker that develops IPUs (intelligence processing units) for data centers. IPUs use graph processing, which process all of the data mapped out on a single graph at once.
Graphcore claims graph processing is more efficient than both scalar and vector processing. Last year, it released the M2000, a plug-and-play AI processing system that directly competes against Nvidia's A100 system. At the time of its launch, the M2000 delivered one petaflop of processing power for $32,450, compared to the A100's price of $39,800 per petaflop.
That price gap highlights a hidden long-term risk to Nvidia, since big data centers require thousands of petaflops of processing power. Nvidia is still much larger and more well-known than Graphcore, but the development of IPUs could challenge the notion that GPUs are the best choice for AI tasks.
2. It's not the world's largest GPU maker
Nvidia controlled 83% of the discrete GPU market in the third quarter of 2021, according to JPR. AMD (NASDAQ: AMD) held the remaining 17%.
Yet Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) is actually the world's largest GPU maker thanks to its integrated graphics chips for lower-end desktops and laptops. If we factor in those chips, Intel controlled 62% of the global GPU market in the third quarter, according to JPR, compared to 20% for Nvidia and 18% for AMD.
That difference wouldn't be worth mentioning if Intel and Nvidia were staying in their own lanes. After all, Intel seemingly abandoned the discrete GPU market more than two decades ago.
But in 2018, Intel announced it would launch a new discrete GPU by 2020. It achieved that goal with the launch of its new Xe GPUs last summer.
The first chips in that series, the Iris Xe Max (DG1), targets Nvidia's GeForce MX and AMD's Radeon RX chips in gaming notebooks. Intel plans to target the desktop market with its higher-end DG2 chips next year, and it's developing an even higher-end GPU (codenamed Ponte Vecchio) to challenge Nvidia's high-end GPUs in the data center market.
Intel hasn't emerged as a major threat yet, but that situation could change as it bundles more of its GPUs with CPUs for OEMs. Nvidia's investors should closely monitor these developments and see if they'll impact the gaming business, which generated 45% of its revenue last quarter.
3. The cryptocurrency market is a double-edged sword
Lastly, investors should pay attention to the cryptocurrency market. The last cryptocurrency boom and bust cycle in 2018 caused major headaches for Nvidia as miners hoarded cards and drove up prices for gamers. After that bubble popped, those miners flooded the secondhand market with used cards, which reduced the appeal of Nvidia's newer GPUs.
Nvidia has taken two major steps to avoid another bubble: It capped the hash rate of its new RTX GPUs to make them less appealing for Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) miners, and released a new line of dedicated crypto mining (CMP) cards to keep its gaming and mining markets separate.
Unfortunately, hackers quickly found a way to bypass Nvidia's hash rate limitations for its RTX cards. Meanwhile, the hot crypto market has recently caused prices for Nvidia's CMP cards to skyrocket, and that trend could make unlocked RTX cards a more cost efficient way to mine Ethereum.
That's the exact scenario Nvidia wanted to avoid, and it could face another ugly boom and bust in the cryptocurrency market in the near future.
Will these factors weigh down Nvidia's stock?
I'm still bullish on Nvidia and its long-term growth potential in the gaming and data center markets. But smart investors shouldn't ignore these three hidden threats, which could all stir up unexpected headwinds and challenge analysts' rising expectations for the beloved chipmaker.

KUALA LUMPUR, Dec 16 (Reuters) - Intel Corp INTC.O will invest more than $7 billion to build a new chip-packaging and testing factory in Malaysia, Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger said on Thursday, expanding production in the country following a global shortage of semiconductors.
The new advanced packaging facility in Malaysia is expected to begin production in 2024, he said.
The 30 billion ringgit ($7.10 billion) investment is expected to create over 4,000 Intel jobs and more than 5,000 construction jobs in the country, the Malaysian government said.
Last month, the United States and Malaysia said they plan to sign an agreement by early next year towards improving transparency, resilience and security in the semiconductor and manufacturing sector supply chains.
A global shortage of semiconductor chips, caused partly by a pandemic-fuelled demand for electronics and disruptions in supply chains has seen car makers cut production and delays in smartphone deliveries at companies including Apple Inc AAPL.O.
Malaysia's chip assembly industry, accounting for more than a tenth of a global trade worth over $20 billion, has warned that shortages will last at least two years.
""This undertaking is indeed timely given the bullish global demand driven by the chip shortages and the potential challenges arising from the recovery of the pandemic globally,"" Malaysian Minister of International Trade and Industry Mohamed Azmin Ali said in a statement.
Intel opened its first production facility outside the United States at a 5-acre assembly site in Penang in 1972. By 1975, it employed about 1,000 people and had become a crucial part of the company's manufacturing chain, its website said.

Nick Sciple: Excited to be here with you. Every time I've had you on the show in the past year, John, there has a lot to talk about. This is a big crazy time in the world of EVs and autos. Let's get to it. First story today: Maybe auto-adjacent Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) announced plans earlier this week to spin out its Mobileye unit. That's the unit that develops chip systems for self-driving cars. Mobileye was publicly traded until Intel acquired the business for about $15 billion in 2015. Today, reports are saying they're seeking a $50 billion valuation for Mobileye. John, what do you make of this news?
John Rosevear: Well, I don't follow Intel itself closely, but I know that Intel has not had a great few years. But on the other hand, Mobileye has gone gangbusters. That $15 billion that Intel paid for them was a hefty premium in 2015. But Mobileye has roughly tripled its revenues since then.
We should back up a bit. Mobileye is an Israeli company led by its co-founder, Amnon Shashua, who is one of the smartest people in the world working on what we call machine vision, processing images that cameras pick up, hence Mobileye, the name of the company. They do business with just about every automaker in the world with the exception of Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) and the possible exception of Toyota. But many things, they have made advances in self-driving software. They are working with Nio, the Chinese electric vehicle maker, on self-driving taxis that are coming very soon. A very impressive company. Has moved very quickly. At the time Intel bought it, it was pretty much the only pure-play self-driving stock. Now, of course, the field is a little more complicated, but I think a $50 billion valuation in the current market given current valuations will be easily reached. Let's put it that way.
Nick Sciple: Where do you put Mobileye in this constellation of, now there's Luminar out there, there's Velodyne? Nvidia, to a certain extent, plays in the self-driving universe. Where does Mobileye fit in there? Would you say they're a leader or a disruptor?
John Rosevear: Well, first of all, they're different from companies like Luminar and Velodyne because they're not making lidar. They're making, essentially, computer chips -- processing chips that process the images harvested by cameras, lidar, and so forth, to help the self-driving car or driver-assist brain, computer brain, make sense of it all. At this point, they've been around 15 years. I want to say something like that, a while. They weren't a new company when Intel bought them in 2015. At that time, they were already selling vision-processing chips to most of the world's automakers. If your car can sense when it's wandering out of lane or anything like that, chances are good that there is a Mobileye chip in that system software. They're vision processing systems on chips. They've gotten a lot more sophisticated since 2015. I think Mobileye remains out front of this. I don't know if you'd call them an incumbent now. They're certainly important to a lot of automakers' plans, whether that automaker is Ford or Nio, let's put it that way.
Nick Sciple: Just to put it in context again to your point, John, of how long they've been around. Gen 1 Autopilot, it was a Mobileye partnership. They've been around since the very earliest days of this business. You mentioned chips. The importance of chips in the auto industry has been a big part of the news this past year. Chip shortage affecting auto supply. Ford made a very significant deal earlier, about a month ago, with GlobalFoundries trying to shore up its chip supply. How does this still fit into the goings-on of the auto industry today?
John Rosevear: Well, it's interesting. In the early days of the auto business, Ford was a pioneer of vertical integration. They had this giant factory in Dearborn, Michigan, where the iron ore arrived on barges, and out the other end came finished cars. They bought rubber, they bought steel, they bought wood at the time when they were making Model Ts and so forth, all stuff. Since then, the auto industry as a whole has gotten away from that. They depend on suppliers. They work with third parties to create parts, and so forth. What we're seeing now, and this is something that Ford CEO Jim Farley has been talking about is going back so that they are taking control of the critical parts of their supply chain. As we've seen over the last couple of years, chips are a critical part of the supply chain. A lot of them come from or have come from China. With geopolitical uncertainties there, also Taiwan. Taiwan is a significant supplier of chips. Likewise, geopolitical uncertainties, and so forth. I think this goes toward automakers wanting factories close to where they build cars generally so that they can drive over or fly over and keep an eye on it [laughs] without needing a passport. GlobalFoundries is a significant company, an established chipmaker, and this is for taking control of another part of its supply chain as we've seen with batteries and other things.
Nick Sciple: Maybe this ties into Ford's ambitions. They said earlier this week they have plans to become the No. 2 EV maker. There has been some reports globally, some reports that they meant in the U.S. But anyway, within the next two years, they want to become the No. 2 EV maker, obviously behind No. 1 Tesla. What do you make of how this fits into Ford's EV ambitions, and I guess, the prospects of them achieving that goal?
John Rosevear: Well, they're not going to become the No. 2 EV maker in the world. I don't think anybody thinks that. For one thing, Volkswagen is ramping pretty aggressively in Europe and China. But it is possible that they could become the No. 2 EV maker in the U.S. or in North America. That would be more aggressive than Ford has led on until recently they say they want to make 600,000 EVs a year in a couple of years. That is significant. I think what Jim Farley with saying when he first said this is we're getting out in front of GM, which has, of course, gotten a lot of plaudits for it's very ambitious EV plans. I think Farley's saying, ""Well, we might not sell them in a couple of years or at least for a little while,"" while they continue to ramp because Ford looked for a long time like they were lagging GM on ramping up to aggressive levels of EV production. But under Farley over the last year and a couple of months, they've really changed that tune a bit. It's just from what they're seeing in their own demand. They've got almost 200,000 reservations for the electric F-150 now. They're saying now they're not going to take any more reservations, or they may close them soon and now start, ""You want one, go to your dealer, place an order."" [laughs]
Nick Sciple: Scarcity mind set.
John Rosevear: Let's do this properly. Somebody at Ford, I think, it might have been Jim Farley himself, said the other day, ""We are frantically trying to figure out how to make twice as many F-150 Lightnings as we had planned."" [laughs] Because the demand is just so high. This is all part of that. Again, I don't think they're going to outdo VW or I do whoever globally. But if they can sell more EVs in the United States than Tesla does, and we know Tesla will be making more EVs, but a lot of those are sold elsewhere. Then that will be a small feather in Ford's cap, and that's what I think that realistically.
Nick Sciple: We'll see how that goes, their one last chip story, Stellantis. This is the company that has been formed from the combination of Fiat, Chrysler, and then the French automaker, Peugeot, announced a deal with Foxconn to develop advanced auto chips. There have been conversations about how much more involved with Foxconn and some of these other traditionally tech suppliers get in the auto industry, and this appears to be much more involved is the answer. What do you make of the Stellantis-Foxconn tie-up?
John Rosevear: Well, two related stories to the chip shortage. First of all, there aren't enough chips for the automakers. Second of other reason there aren't enough. It's because they have until recently relied on these older-style designs that hold up well over time and that serve their function and are inexpensive. The chip manufacturing companies want to move away from those and make more-sophisticated chips that they can get better margins on for personal computers and phones and devices and things like that.
There's two parts to this story with Foxconn. First of all, Stellantis is like everybody else trying to lock in their own chips supply. Second of all, they are working with Foxconn, or the plan is to work with Foxconn to develop more-sophisticated chips for their cars, which would start rolling out in a year and a half, two years, something like that. That is also a trend we're seeing. I mean, there was some talk from around that with the GlobalFoundries deal. GM has been talking about that as well, and others around the world. Let's go to more sophisticated chips. ""Let's take control of our supply chain and get chips tailored for our cars that may offer some sort of advantage."" Because when you step back and look at EVs, there are a lot more similar to one another than internal combustion vehicles are. Automakers are thinking about how do we differentiate our products? How do we get people to buy a Ford versus a Chevy? How do we get people to buy even a Tesla versus what may be coming in a few years, Polestar or something? The answer is software and functionality and features, and if you have your own custom chips, they can play to your strengths and deliver on the features that you want, and so there's that as well here.
Nick Sciple: Yes. I mean, as we see this big wave of EVs come to market. You mentioned this, the strong demand that some of these companies are seeing. You've got to develop the supply chain to deliver those products, and we're seeing that on the chip side with the GlobalFoundries deal. The slot to stay with Foxconn that we talked about. One other place we're seeing it which maybe transitions us to our next story is, yes, you got to have components to make these batteries. You have to have some of these commodities, and so earlier this morning, GM announced a long-term deal with MP Materials to develop, ""A fully integrated U.S. supply chain for rare earth magnets to be used in an upcoming EVs."" What is the significance of this deal, John? You're on mute.
John Rosevear: Damn, I'm sorry, what's? We talked about rare earths. These are elements that are used to make magnets, so not actually rare, it's just that there aren't a lot of them coming out of the ground, or weren't until recently. What GM is doing is locking up supply that isn't dependent on some of the conflict minerals regions like the Congo and so forth, where a lot of cobalt comes from. MP Materials, I don't know a lot about them. I do know that an analyst I trust on this stuff since that their CEO is probably the smartest person about rare earth minerals in North America. GM went to the right company and is doing the right thing. The deal here is their production begins in 2023, and they're going to supply magnets and alloys for ""More than a dozen of GM's upcoming EVs based on its second-generation"", what they call the Ultium platform, which is a modular platform for electric vehicles that it's going to underpin most GM products once they go fully electric.
Nick Sciple: MP Materials. One of these companies that came public in the last year or so, I believe it was a SPAC deal, and so they're going to be developing some US-based rare earth supply. The question was, how much demand is there going to be for this? Clearly, when GM and some of these other companies are signing deals as more and more credibility to that business thesis. Again, we've talked about all this EV supply that needs to, folks want to come to market, whether it's from a public policy point of view or from the consumer demand. Point of view to make that happen, you need some of these raw materials and that's going to trickle through to some companies like MP. Potentially could be an interesting investment will see.
John Rosevear: Yes, this analyst's take was at Ford and Tesla should go cut the same deal with MP as well [laughs] because this hasn't changed. I mean, the analysts' fund is long MP I think, but still, this is another thing like with the chips and so forth, we are going to be seeing more deals coming.
Nick Sciple: Yes, if we're going to make these cars, you got to have the inputs to cars. Either one of those inputs are batteries. Another announcement this week is that Toyota is going to be developing a battery factory in North Carolina. What do you make at this deal?
John Rosevear: A little different take on this one. Toyota among the major global automakers has been kind of dragging their feet a lot on EVs. They want to sell more hybrids. They think hybrids are a better intermediate solution and so forth. I will note that this was a splashy announcement. But if you look at the fine details, this 1.29 billion that they're spending as part of an announcement that they announced earlier this year. It's batteries for 200,000 vehicles, but that's not all EVS, it's hybrids and EVs in a mix to be determined. Production isn't going to start until 2025. This is something that's being done at all possible speed right now. It is an interesting deal. Again, I do feel this is Toyota's management saying, ""Hey wade us too"", [laughs] in light of all these announcements as well. But I think we need to wait and see if Toyota steps up with a more aggressive EV commitment than I have so far.
Nick Sciple: Moving on with, we've talked a bunch about some of these traditional automakers trying nipping at Tesla's heels. Let's talk about Tesla now. I had a strong earnings report, but as always with Tesla, lots of other headlines out there, Elon has sold a significant amount of stock, and there are some reports this week about some SEC related investigations related to solar panels. What do you make of all the news around Tesla?
John Rosevear: [laughs] I mean, Tesla is an entire beat for a couple of reporters all on its own. There are major publications who have people on the Tesla beat full-time. Elon selling given where the stock is, I'm not really surprised [laughs] fairly be selling too. Years and years ago, Elon said his capital would be the last out around the time of Tesla's IPO. But I mean, he did at least make a show of going to Tesla fans and Tesla's shareholders on Twitter and saying, ""Hey, look, I'm thinking about selling. Are you OK with that?"" and the response way sure Elon, sell a bit. He has been doing that. But more to the SEC investigation, there was a battle between Tesla Solar division, the company formerly known as SolarCity, had to deal with Walmart to install solar panels on the roofs of its stores and the installations didn't go well and there were some fire issues and some complaints, and there was the battle back and forth. Now, this is the SEC stepping in and saying, we're going to take a closer look at this. We're going to look at whether you warned your investors properly that there was some risk here. What I'm wondering is if they're going to go way back and reopen the SolarCity merger, which was built as this is a whole brand new component for Tesla. Detractors said it was in-line bailing out is cousins who had started this SolarCity, the solar panel firm. I don't know where this goes. Previous SEC investigations have not had much impact on Tesla, either on its share price or on its behavior. [laughs] So I don't know what this is going to do either. I wouldn't expect too many fireworks. [inaudible 02:45:58]
Nick Sciple: Yeah. What I would say is, the strength of Tesla's business is much stronger than maybe it would've been previously, and there have been similar headlines that the company has persevered through. I think, I wouldn't blame our shareholders for looking through some of the stuff as well. Not to be outdone on the SEC investigations front, Lucid Motors also announced earlier this week, an SEC investigation, shares down about 18 percent in the past week. What's going on with Lucid?
John Rosevear: We don't know, and Lucid doesn't know. What they said in an 8K and SEC filing was, ""We got subpoenaed for some documents. The SEC asked us to produce a bunch of documents. The documents are related to the run-up to the SPAC merger that took us public earlier in the year. We don't know exactly what they're doing, but it appears that's what they're looking at."" That's all Lucid said. The stock has gone down hard. I think, because people in this space are mindful of the past examples of companies like Nikola and Lordstown Motors, where a short seller came out and made allegations, and then the company went away for a couple of months and huddled with some investigators and came back and said, ""Yeah, well, OK, there is something to those allegations."" This might just be the SEC doing a checkup. What I said on the day that this news broke on fool.com is that, unlike Nikola and Lordstown Motors, Lucid is shipping a vehicle that delivers on their claims. They said, our vehicle will have huge range, and it will do this, and it will do that as part of the case for supporting a merger deal, for buying the SPAC, for buying the stock. The Lucid are already shipping, and independent testers have verified that, sure enough, it does have this great range and this advanced technology, build quality is good, and so forth. Reviews have been very positive. I think, the risk that we saw with something like Nikola and Lordstown, where the investment case is based on these grand technological claims, promises of huge numbers of pre-orders, this thing, and then that all went away, and the stock plummeted, and new management came in and had to reset and all that. I don't think that's a likely path for this on Lucid. Sure, there may have been problems with some of the numbers, but I come back to the fact that they're shipping a car that delivered on their promises. I think, the company will weather this, and if you still believe in the story, this might be a buying opportunity.
Nick Sciple: There's much more of a there relative to those other names you mentioned, the Nikola and etc. There's not a car being pushed down a hill, in this case. There's a real car driving public.
John Rosevear: Yeah, exactly. There's a factory building real cars, and real third party reviewers have had their hands on them and said, ""Yeah, Lucid delivered on what it said it was going to deliver."" It's possible that the SPAC leadership was playing financial games or something like that, I don't know. But my sense is that Lucid will weather this just fine, whatever it is. Of course, we may have to update that view at some point. We'll see.
Nick Sciple: There are certainly things to be concerned about, I guess, at a $65 billion market cap. I just looked here, but less of a rug pool situation, I think, as far as the substance, than maybe we've seen with those others. John, we've talked about, a bunch of these stories in the headlines. We do have a few minutes here. You didn't prepare for this, but I'm going to ask you off the top of your head. What is the story we haven't talked about today, that folks should be following, or that's most interesting for you as someone who is intimately familiar with the automotive space?
John Rosevear: Oh, good lord. The Meta story. We talked a little bit about this at the beginning of the program, where we had all the new EV entrance coming to the public markets via SPAC and so forth earlier in the year. We had Tesla's big run-up starting in late 2019 and so on. Now, we're at the empire strikes back, part of the story, and that the big stories in the EV space are about Ford, and General Motors, and Volkswagen, and Stellantis. Even while some of these smaller companies are making headway and stuff, but it's just, the scale of when a company like Volkswagen pivots to EV is just so massive, that it affects the whole supply chain. Billions of dollars have to be spent before any significant volume is attained, and they've already spent quite a few billion dollars. This stuff that's coming, the Ford Mustang Mach-E came out early this year. I think, some people who were very attached to the idea that Tesla is 10 years ahead of the rest of the industry were perhaps pleasantly surprised, I hope pleasantly surprised, by the fact that the Mach-E is a good EV. It delivers on its range claims, it delivers on its performance claims. It's well-built, and it's nice to drive. No, it doesn't have the Tesla's Supercharger network, but on the other hand, nobody's really upset about the build quality either as we've seen on some Tesla models, particularly in early production. I think, that's the big story. This is the part where we see what people like me have been talking about for several years, which is, here comes the big automakers with a whole lot of electric vehicles. This transition is for real.
Nick Sciple: I think, yeah, folks probably underestimating the scale of what this looks like, and also I think, to the things we talked about earlier, how that trickles through the supply chain. Whether that's rare earth materials, or chips, or any of that, we're getting to real scale here now, and this is going to make real impacts in the world. John, always excited to keep up with those impacts and the latest developments here with you, and I look forward to doing it with you again sometime soon.

2021-12-15 00:00:00+00:00,Where Will Intel Stock Be in 10 Years?,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/where-will-intel-stock-be-in-10-years,,,"Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) stock has lagged the broader market by a huge margin over the past decade, and its woes have been accelerated by the loss of its manufacturing and technology lead to rival foundry Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSMC) in 2018.
TSMC leapfrogged Intel when it started the mass production of chips based on the 7 nanometer (nm) manufacturing process. Chipzilla, meanwhile, failed to make the jump to the competing 10 nm process, triggering a downfall in its fortunes on the stock market as rivals such as Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) started eating its cake.
INTC data by YCharts
The bad news is that AMD seems in no mood to take its foot off the gas -- but that doesn't necessarily mean that Intel can't fight back. The company seems to be on the way to reclaiming its lost mojo. Let's look at the steps the chip giant has been taking, and see where they may lead it in the next decade.
Intel is on the road to redemption
AMD's Ryzen processors have been a thorn in Intel's flesh as their superior performance and aggressive pricing have helped them gain market share. However, Intel has been showing signs of turning around thanks to its new products. Citing sales data compiled from German retailer Mindfactory, third-party sources report that Intel has started gaining ground against AMD's Ryzen processors thanks to the launch of its latest Alder Lake chips.
More specifically, Intel's CPU (central processing unit) market share at Mindfactory increased to 30% in November 2021 compared to 23% in October, which is its highest at the retailer this year. While investors should take this market share data with a pinch of salt, as it includes sales from just one regional retailer, they shouldn't forget that Intel's resurgence coincides with the launch of chips based on the 10 nm Alder Lake platform.
Image source: Getty Images.
That's not surprising, as the density of the Alder Lake chips brings them up to par with AMD's latest processors, which are based on a 7 nm manufacturing process. Third-party tests have shown that the Alder Lake processors are giving their AMD counterparts a run for their money, and are priced aggressively. This indicates that Intel may now be on its way to catching up to its rivals, especially considering the company's product roadmap and investments.
First off, Intel believes that it can ship ""several million units of Alder Lake to customers"" in the second half of 2021. These chips will be followed by the Raptor Lake chips in 2022, which will be based on an enhanced version of the 10 nm process, which could help Intel further reduce the technology gap with AMD. However, it is in 2023 that things are likely to get interesting.
Intel's Meteor Lake chips, based on a 7 nm manufacturing process, are currently being tested, and are expected to hit the market in 2023. These processors could level the field with AMD, which is expected to release its 5 nm line-up late in 2022, setting the stage for a showdown between the two companies in 2023.
The early signs seem promising, as the performance of the Alder Lake chips indicates. More importantly, Intel's product roadmap through 2025 is built in a way so that it can regain its process lead from the likes of TSMC and Samsung.
Intel has also laid out an aggressive capital spending plan to ensure that its plan of leaving behind rivals in four years can be realized. It plans capital spending of $25 billion to $28 billion in 2022, which could increase further in the following years to support its product development initiatives. That would be a huge increase over the $20 billion capital expenditure Intel has planned for 2021, indicating that Chipzilla is about to go full throttle to race ahead of rivals.
Looking past 2025
If Intel's medium-term plan of reducing the gap with its rivals sounds promising, then the company's long-term strategy of leaving them behind certainly looks quite ambitious. The chip giant has revealed the way it plans to increase the speed of its chips while reducing their size at the same time beyond 2025.
The chipmaker plans to pack 30% to 50% more transistors into its chips using a three-dimensional process of stacking chiplets that aims to deliver a 10x jump in density improvement. Intel says that this process of fitting ""millions more transistors per die area"" can lead to more powerful computing capabilities in the coming decade.
A denser processor node that packs more transistors closely together means that Intel will be able to deliver a nice jump in computing power while keeping power consumption in check. That's because processors made using a smaller node are more power-efficient since they consume less energy to perform calculations, which allows them to perform more calculations without getting too hot.
As Intel is planning a huge jump in processor density by packing in more transistors, the company is looking to pull ahead of its rivals in the long run. So Chipzilla could once again become the king of the semiconductor industry in the next 10 years. That could infuse life into the stock after years of underperformance -- but Intel will need to ensure that it continues to execute well, and avoid the struggles that led the company to lose its technology lead in the past.
