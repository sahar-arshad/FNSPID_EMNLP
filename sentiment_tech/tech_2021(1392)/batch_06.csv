Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) has been an absolute beast on the long side. Despite that truth, AMD stock can actually be pretty tough to trade at times.

The stock tends to go on sharp, robust runs and then consolidate for quite a while. However, patient bulls in this stock continue to be rewarded. That’s exactly what I’ve been pounding the table on — patience.  
If there’s one industry — or one duo — that I have a good pulse on, it’s AMD and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). Both of these companies are incredibly well run and while the stocks don’t always reflect their great businesses, the share prices eventually reward shareholders. 
With AMD, the writing was all over the wall — almost literally.
Trading AMD Stock

Going into earnings in July, I made the case to own AMD stock regardless of the earnings outcome. A few days later, Advanced Micro Devices reported strong earnings and the stock exploded to new all-time highs as a result. 
This triggered a massive breakout over the $99 to $100 level, but that was followed by a somewhat disappointing 18% correction back to this breakout area. 
Like I said though, the bullish clues that new highs were coming were written all over the charts. We never forgot the massive volume that accompanied the stock’s post-earnings rally. 
Save this chart. Bookmark this article. Whatever you need to do to imprint this image in your mind, because this is what “accumulation” volume looks like. 
That’s when institutions pile into a stock, leaving their “footprints” all over the chart in the form of volume. This had the hallmarks of institutional accumulation. While that doesn’t guarantee new highs necessarily, it’s a decent bet that it means, “there’s more where that came from.”
7 Stocks to Watch Now as Consumer Prices Spike
AMD found support at the prior $99 to $100 breakout zone before giving a powerful weekly-up rotation. That may very well have led to one of the best trades of the year. Further, it helped kick-start an absolutely massive secondary trade in Nvidia, which paid off quite well too. 
Finally, AMD stock gave bulls a nice reset to start off November and the stock responded with a 19.5% burst. Rarely do we get to double dip in a trade like this, catching a bulk of the upside and then catching the downside reversal.
So, What’s the Trade?
From here, we need to give the stock a rest. For traders, that means trimming into strength and/or raising their stop-losses. For investors, it means appreciating the move, but expecting potentially sideways-to-lower price action in the short to immediate term. 
Am I bearish? Absolutely not. But am I cognizant that Nvidia and AMD are up 50% to 60% over the past six weeks and that action can only last so long? Yes. 
Bulls have been quite fortunate in this name. I’m hoping the above chart can serve as an educational tool to readers. It highlights the following:
A massive upside rally with accumulation volume. Learn to spot these!
A pullback to the prior breakout zone.
The weekly-up trigger that launched AMD higher, then the ensuing “reset” trade that sent AMD to new all-time highs. 
Lastly, the reversal trade that let bulls exit the trade with monstrous gains and gave aggressive traders a short-selling opportunity.
Betting on AMD’s Long-Term Future
AMD stock just gave bulls one of the best trades of the year. The best part about all of this is that the company continues to deliver on the fundamentals too. 
It’s a very mixed and mostly downbeat situation for growth stocks. Many of the best growth stocks are well off the highs right now, but not AMD and Nvidia. Both stocks remain superior to picks like Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) too. They are real outliers, outshining growth and value stocks. 
That’s because consensus estimates continue to underestimate what AMD and Nvidia are doing right now. Nvidia just delivered a top- and bottom-line beat and better-than-expected guidance. AMD did the same thing, while delivering 54% revenue growth. 
The more that technology grows, the more that companies need better components. Increased data means increasing data center performance. That equates to more orders for AMD and Nvidia. This new push for the “metaverse” has AMD in demand too. So do computer graphics, gaming, AI and machine learning applications, autonomous driving — you name it. There are countless end markets for GPUs. 
If there’s one fly in the ointment, it’s future growth concerns. 
With one quarter left to go for this fiscal year, analysts expect AMD to grow sales 19.5% next year, then 14% in the following year. Some might say the stock has rallied too far given these estimates. Maybe so. And in that case, we may see a multi-quarter consolidation phase, which most long-term investors are fine with. 
But it’s also possible that these estimates are too conservative. 
In late July, 2022 revenue estimates sat at about $17 billion. After earnings in July, they shot up to $18 billion. After the last report in October, these expectations moved above $19 billion. You can see how this theme has been playing out. 
For now, I still have no reason to bet against AMD (or Nvidia) even though it’s clear that the stocks need a break.

Nov 22 (Reuters) - British technology firm IQE Plc IQE.L on Monday named New York-based peer GlobalFoundries' GFS.O Americo Lemos as its chief executive officer effective Jan. 10, ending a roughly year-long search for a successor to founder Drew Nelson.
Nelson last year announced plans to step down after three decades at the helm of IQE, which makes semiconductor wafers for chips used in Apple AAPL.O products. He will be become president of the board.
""The depth and breadth of (Lemos') industry expertise make him the natural choice to take the business forward in its next stage of growth,"" said IQE Executive Chairman Phil Smith.
Lemos takes charge of the company at a time when countries are poised for a rollout of 5G technology, which is also a significant new market for chipmakers such as IQE.
Lemos, 54, was responsible for development for GlobalFoundries' business in Asia Pacific and China - major regional markets for IQE - and has also had stints with Qualcomm QCOM.O, Intel INTC.O , Texas Instruments TXN.O and Skyworks SWKS.O.

2021-11-20 00:00:00+00:00,3 Top Chip Stocks Ready for Bull Runs,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-top-chip-stocks-ready-for-bull-runs-2021-11-20,,,"The global chip shortage has been generating strong tailwinds for the semiconductor sector over the past year. However, it might be difficult for investors to separate the winners from the losers if they don't understand how the semiconductor supply chain works.
Today, I'll highlight three chip stocks that operate in very different parts of the semiconductor market, why they're all growing, and why they could still generate even bigger returns next year.
Image source: Getty Images.
1. ASML
ASML Holding (NASDAQ: ASML) is a Dutch semiconductor equipment maker. It's the world's largest manufacturer of lithography machines, which are used to etch circuit patterns onto silicon wafers. It's also the only manufacturer of high-end extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machines, which are required to manufacture the world's smallest chips.
The world's most advanced chip foundries -- including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM), Samsung, and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) -- all use ASML's EUV machines, which cost about $150,000 each and require several planes to ship. ASML's dominance of this crucial chipmaking technology, which it refined over the past three decades, makes it a linchpin of the global semiconductor market.
ASML's revenue rose 8% in 2019 and 18% in 2020, and it anticipates about 35% growth this year. It's selling EUV systems as rapidly as it can produce them, and a growing mix of those higher-margin devices boosted its gross margin from 44.7% in 2019 to 52.2% in the first nine months of 2021.
ASML's stock price has more than doubled over the past 12 months, and it isn't cheap at 45 times forward earnings. However, this stock could still have plenty of upside potential as the chip shortage drags on -- since it will be impossible to resolve the crisis without buying significantly more machines from ASML.
2. UMC
ASML's top client is TSMC, the world's largest contract chipmaker and another linchpin of the semiconductor market. However, TSMC's smaller rival United Microelectronics (NYSE: UMC) is a more underrated play on the same trend.
Unlike TSMC -- which manufactures the world's smallest chips for fabless chipmakers like Advanced Micro Devices and Apple -- UMC primarily manufactures older, larger, and cheaper chips for cars, Internet of Things (IoT) devices, and other gadgets.
These chips aren't as powerful as TSMC's top-tier chips, but they're arguably just as essential. UMC's plants are already operating at their maximum capacities, but the company faces less pressure to aggressively upgrade its plants than TSMC, Samsung, or Intel, which are all engaged in the costly ""process race"" to manufacture smaller and more advanced chips.
UMC ranks a distant third in the foundry market behind TSMC and Samsung, but it still generates impressive growth: Its revenue rose 4% in 2019 and jumped 25% in 2020, and analysts expect 18% growth this year.
UMC's stock has more than doubled over the past 12 months, but it still looks reasonably valued at 22 times forward earnings. Like ASML, UMC will continue to profit from the chip shortage. Moreover, the traffic jam at TSMC and other top foundries could eventually divert more lower-end orders to UMC.
3. Micron
Lastly, I believe Micron Technology (NASDAQ: MU) -- one of the world's leading producers of DRAM and NAND memory chips -- is currently undervalued at eight times forward earnings. Micron's stock has risen nearly 30% over the past 12 months, but it's stalled out in recent months amid fears of a cyclical slowdown.
Micron's revenue fell 8% in fiscal 2020 (which ended last September) as a global glut of memory chips caused market prices to plunge. But in fiscal 2021, its revenue rose 29% as those supplies and prices stabilized.
Micron wasn't directly affected by the chip shortage, since it manufactures its own chips instead of outsourcing them to third-party foundries. However, it expects shortages of other PC components -- including CPUs and GPUs -- to indirectly curb the market's near-term demand for its memory chips. That warning, along with a softer-than-expected forecast for the first quarter, spooked investors last month.
Nonetheless, analysts still expect Micron's revenue and earnings to rise 15% and 44%, respectively, this year, as it benefits from the secular expansion of the gaming, data center, cloud, 5G, and automotive markets. Those catalysts might also spark a ""super cycle"" in memory chip upgrades, which could last much longer than previous cycles and propel Micron's stock to fresh highs next year.

2021-11-19 00:00:00+00:00,The 30 Best Stocks of the Past 30 Years,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/the-30-best-stocks-of-the-past-30-years,,,"Advocates of buy-and-hold index investing have a fresh batch of powerful evidence supporting the wisdom of their ways, new research shows.
Not only do the majority of stocks deliver long-term underperformance vs. pretty much the least risky asset you can find, but the great bulk of equity-market wealth is created by just a tiny percentage of the very best stocks.
A study of the performance of more than 64,000 global stocks from January 1990 to December 2020 revealed that the compound returns of 55.2% of U.S. stocks, as well as 57.4% of non-U.S. stocks, underperformed essentially risk-free one-month U.S. Treasury bills. Moreover, the entirety of the $75.7 trillion in net global stock market wealth created over the past 30 years was generated solely by the top-performing 2.4% of stocks.

Accurately identifying the precious few ""home run"" stocks amid the many thousands of underachieving names is extremely difficult. Your portfolio is more likely to suffer because you guessed wrong and failed to invest in the market's best stocks over the long term. (A better alternative to trying to find a needle in a haystack? To paraphrase Jack Bogle, the Vanguard founder and pioneer of index investing: Just buy the haystack.)
But to be fair, those who guessed right and bet big have accumulated truly transformational wealth.
Here are the 30 best stocks of the past 30 years, measured by wealth created between January 1990 and December 2020. A quick note on wealth creation: The stocks below didn't necessarily deliver the highest percent changes in share price. Rather, they created the most shareholder wealth, which is essentially the increase in market value adjusted for cash flows in and out of the business, such as dividends and share repurchases.
Think of it this way: A microcap penny stock that grows into a small-cap stock after delivering a 10,000% price increase rewards anyone lucky enough to have bet on that name – but it adds very little to equity investors' overall collective wealth. It doesn't drive the major indexes higher, fill the coffers of pension funds or enrich anyone beyond a comparatively small number of traders and investors involved in the stock.
However, these 30 top stocks – a fairly familiar collection of Dow stocks, longtime dividend growth stocks, and mostly well-known foreign firms – have generated massive wealth for a great many investors over the decades.

30. Nvidia
Wealth created: $309.4 billion
Annualized dollar weighted return: 27.5%
Country: U.S.
Nvidia (NVDA) only recently muscled its way into the best stocks of the past three decades. Indeed, although the maker of graphics processing units (GPUs) was founded in 1993, it didn't go public until 1999. And although NVDA was a longtime market beater over the next decade-plus – and by a wide margin at that – shares went truly ballistic only in the past few years. 
So what changed? 
Sign up for Kiplinger's FREE Closing Bell e-letter: Our daily look at the stock market's most important headlines, and what moves investors should make.
Back in the day, NVDA's primary market consisted of PC and console video game enthusiasts. Happily for Nvidia, it just so happens that the power and architecture required to drive video games is also perfect for applications such as artificial intelligence (AI), data servers, supercomputers, mobile chips and even cryptocurrency mining.
Few blue chips offer so much exposure to so many emerging endeavors and technologies, which explains the semiconductor stock's relatively recent meteoric rise – and the outsized wealth it created for shareholders.

29. Walt Disney
Wealth created: $311.6 billion
Annualized dollar weighted return: 10.6%
Country: U.S.
Walt Disney (DIS) isn't just one of the best stocks of the past 30 years; it's also one of the top stocks of all time. 
Shareholders can thank Disney's adaptability to an ever-changing media landscape for their outsized returns. In the past 20 years alone, Disney has gobbled up Pixar Animation Studios, Marvel Entertainment, Lucasfilm (of Star Wars fame) and much of 21st Century Fox. ESPN and the Disney Channel are just two of its many cable properties. The company's Disney+ streaming platform debuted as a smashing success. And let's not forget to mention Disney's theme parks, which remain global attractions. 
Disney – a component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average since 1991 – has had its pandemic ups and downs recently, but you can't quibble with the stock’s past performance. Shares in the sprawling entertainment conglomerate have delivered outstanding multi-decade returns.

28. Oracle
Wealth created: $318.5 billion
Annualized dollar weighted return: 19.5%
Country: U.S.
Founded in 1977 and publicly traded since 1986, Oracle (ORCL) got its start as a provider of database management software. 
As much as any high-tech company of the era, it rode the late-1990s tech bubble to lofty heights ... and then crashed. A long, slow recovery followed – it took about 14 years for ORCL to regain its pre-crash peak – driven by a wide portfolio of software aimed at corporate customers. 
But what really changed the company's fortunes was its often painful transition away from traditional software licensing to providing cloud-based services. It took a while for the market to buy into Oracle's transformation story, but once it did, the stock returned to its market-beating ways. Analysts project the company to deliver average annual earnings per share growth of 8.4% over the next three to five years. 
Whether that's enough to drive further share-price outperformance remains to be seen.

27. LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton
Wealth created: $327.3 billion
Annualized dollar weighted return: 12.4%
Country: France
LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton (LVMUY) is proof positive that luxury pays. 
The French conglomerate's operations comprise a sort of who's who in luxe living: fashion house Louis Vuitton; prestige brands such as Givenchy and Marc Jacobs; Bulgari and TAG Heuer watches; Christian Dior perfumes; Tiffany & Co. jewelry; Moët et Chandon champagne ... the list goes on and on. 
Sign up for Kiplinger's FREE Investing Weekly e-letter for stock, ETF and mutual fund recommendations, and other investing advice.
The company was formed in 1987 via the merger of fashion house Louis Vuitton with Moët Hennessy. The combined company continued on its acquisitive path, and today claims a total of 75 prestige brands (or maisons, as the company calls them) organized into six business groups. 
The pursuit of diversification through acquisitions – and the fact that luxury goods tend to hold up comparatively well during economic downturns – has allowed LVMH to create outsized wealth over the past three decades. It also doesn't hurt that luxury brands command fat profit margins. 
Need proof? LVMH boasts a gross margin – or the difference between sales and cost of goods sold – of 64.5%. At the other end of the spectrum, discount retailer Walmart's (WMT) gross margin sits at 24.8%.

26. Coca-Cola
Wealth created: $329.5 billion
Annualized dollar weighted return: 12.9%
Country: U.S.
Tech stocks have been the market darlings of the past three decades, but that doesn't mean classic consumer brands have automatically gone out of fashion. 
Witness Coca-Cola (KO), a member of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, a dividend stalwart and one of Warren Buffett's all-time favorite stocks. 
KO has maintained its edge over the decades by adding teas, coffee, sports and energy drinks, bottled waters, juices, and dairy and plant-based beverages to its traditional portfolio of fizzy refreshments. The company's ever-expanding lineup has allowed it to remain relevant as one of the world's most recognizable brands, even as consumers’ thirst for carbonated beverages has cooled.
Another key to KO's wealth-creation record is its generous and rising dividend. Coca-Cola has paid a quarterly dividend since 1920, and that cash payout has increased annually for 60 straight years.

25. Intel
Wealth created: $340.2 billion
Annualized dollar weighted return: 16.0%
Country: U.S.
Intel (INTC) has been one of the best stocks of the past 30 years, but it's hard to see the semiconductor maker extending that record for another 30 years. 
Founded in 1968, INTC is an old-timer among technology companies, and the chipmaker's longevity has paid off handsomely for shareholders. Its early start positioned the company to run away with the market for the chips that serve as a computer’s brain. Intel had close to 100% market share in central processing units (CPUs) for personal computers at one point. It continues to claim around 80% today. Intel also remains the biggest player in making CPUs for back-end servers, which are very much in demand to power the rapid shift to cloud-based computing. 
What's troubling is that Intel missed opportunities in mobile and numerous other applications. As a result, the Dow stock has been a market laggard for quite some time and nas never recaptured its 2000 tech-bubble levels.

24. Altria
Wealth created: $364.6 billion
Annualized dollar weighted return: 17.0%
Country: U.S.
Altria (MO) is another stock whose greatest days of wealth creation are probably behind it. 
But, hey, you never know.
The tobacco company doesn't have the greatest earnings growth prospects given ever-growing restrictions against its primary product. But it does generate a river of reliable free cash flow, which it returns to shareholders in the form of generous dividends. And MO's strategy of diversification and innovation has allowed it to deliver steady, if incremental, top-line growth. 
Best known for its iconic Marlboro brand of cigarettes, Altria’s operating businesses continue to focus on tobacco: namely, cigarettes and heated tobacco products (Philip Morris USA), smokeless tobacco (U.S. Smokeless Tobacco) and cigars (John Middleton). Altria also owns St. Michelle Wine Estates, a major wine producer. 
As a reminder: Altria changed its name from Philip Morris Cos. in 2003. Philip Morris International (PM) is a separate publicly traded company that was spun off from Altria in 2008 to sell cigarettes outside the U.S.

23. UnitedHealth Group
Wealth created: $370.2 billion
Annualized dollar weighted return: 21.2%
Country: U.S.
A string of acquisitions has helped make UnitedHealth Group (UNH) the largest health insurance company by market value and revenue – and by wide margins at that. It's also the most influential stock in the price-weighted Dow Jones Industrial Average. 
The company was incorporated under the UnitedHealthcare name in 1977 and went public in 1984. Since then, it hasn't looked back. Along the way, it beefed up its businesses by buying or merging with MetraHealth, HealthWise of America and AmeriChoice, among many others. 
The company's Optum business is one of the largest pharmacy benefits managers in the U.S. and has been a main driver of UNH's share-price outperformance over the past few years. Indeed, UNH stock has beaten the broader market by substantial margins over the past five-, 10- and 15-year periods.
And Wall Street expects more good times ahead. In fact, UnitedHealth Group routinely ranks among analysts' favorite blue-chip stocks to buy.

Although it has cooled off over the past few years, China's economy experienced a kind of explosive expansion over the last three decades that has rarely been seen on the world historical stage. The Middle Kingdom's e-commerce growth has been equally stunning. 
So it should come as no surprise that Alibaba (BABA) makes an appearance on this list. 
The e-commerce giant is often called the Amazon.com (AMZN) of China, and although there are important differences between the two, they do share a number of enviable traits. Alibaba – just like Amazon – has never shied away from investing heavily in itself to both build out its existing businesses and enter new ones. As a result, BABA also finds itself spreading its tentacles far beyond its core e-commerce business into cloud computing, digital payments and much, much more. 
Chinese policymakers are cracking down on the country's tech sector, and that has caused considerable pain for BABA shareholders since late 2020. Nevertheless, the company remains a top name in total wealth creation.

21. Mastercard
Wealth created: $374.9 billion
Annualized dollar weighted return: 33.0%
Country: U.S.
Payments processors are hot properties these days. And analysts, hedge funds, billionaires and even Warren Buffett single out Mastercard (MA) in particular as one of their favorite stocks to buy. 
Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway owns 4.6 million shares in Mastercard – a position initiated by lieutenant portfolio managers Todd Combs and Ted Weschler. Buffett has said he wishes he had pulled the trigger sooner, but if MA's future performance is anything like its past, the Oracle of Omaha will stop kicking himself soon enough. 
Analysts credit MA's long-term outperformance to its ""powerful brand, vast global acceptance network and strong business model."" Substantial barriers to entry, thanks to Mastercard's massive scale, global reach, security and data management skills, information intelligence and trust, have also served it well. 
Bulls say the relentless global adoption of digital transactions should keep Mastercard's record for wealth creation on track for the foreseeable future.

20. Roche
Wealth created: $377.3 billion
Annualized dollar weighted return: 14.1%
Country: Switzerland
Swiss healthcare giant Roche (RHHBY) is the world's largest pharmaceutical company by market value, and the second-largest by trailing 12-month revenue. The holding company also has a large diagnostics business, but it's the pharma division – and its leadership in cancer treatments – that gets the most attention from global investors. 
A series of acquisitions and partnerships have been critical to driving the company's outsized wealth creation over the past three decades. The company's holdings and investments are vast, and include U.S. biotechnology company Genentech, Hoffmann-La Roche France, Ventana Medical Systems and Disetronic Holding AG. 
A strategy of acquisitions, strategic alliances and investments has helped keep Roche's pipeline full of blockbuster drugs. The firm counts oncology treatments Avastin, Perjeta and Herceptin among its bestsellers. 
Roche also stands out – and does well by its shareholders – as a dividend machine. Indeed, the company is a European Dividend Aristocrat, having maintained or increased its dividend annually for more than three decades.

19. Visa
Wealth created: $385.0 billion
Annualized dollar weighted return: 23.8%
Country: U.S.
Visa (V) wasn’t even known as Visa when the company got its start in 1958 after Bank of America (BAC) launched its BankAmericard credit card program. But as the card gained popularity abroad, the name was changed in 1976 to Visa because it was easier to pronounce. 
Today, Visa operates the world's largest payments network. Despite its short life as a publicly traded company and the ill timing of its IPO – Visa went public in March 2008 during the global financial crisis – the stock has already created $385.0 billion in wealth for shareholders. Heck, including dividends, Visa's stock has returned 861% over the past 10 years. That beats the S&P 500's total return by nearly 490 percentage points. 
And analysts expect more of the same going forward, thanks to the ongoing revolution in digital transactions. Visa, like rival Mastercard, is a favorite name with analysts, hedge funds and billionaires, including Warren Buffett. Berkshire Hathaway owns more than 9.5 million shares in the payments processor.

18. Kweichow Moutai
Wealth created: $395.9 billion
Annualized dollar weighted return: 39.0%
Country: China
China's growth over the past three decades into the world's second-largest economy has made fortunes across a range of industries. And that definitely extends to booze. As much as has been made about the Middle Kingdom's unbalanced economy – that it depends too much on investment and too little on consumption – don't tell that to shareholders in Kweichow Moutai (SHSE:600519). 
The company, which trades only on the Shanghai Stock Exchange, is the world's largest beverage company, with a market value of roughly U.S. $345 billion. Diageo (DEO) is a distant second with less than half its Chinese counterpart's market cap. 
In addition to being the largest beverage company in the world, Kweichow Moutai is also China's most valuable non-technology company.
Prodigious consumption of Kweichow Moutai's spirits and wines helped create nearly $400 billion in wealth over the past three decades – albeit with much of that wealth piling up rather recently. The pandemic, you see, was particularly kind to the company. Lockdowns led to a surge in demand for spirits, which in turn sent shares soaring nearly 70% in 2020.

17. Home Depot
Wealth created: $399.8 billion
Annualized dollar weighted return: 16.6%
Country: U.S.
Home Depot (HD), the nation's largest home improvement retailer, has been a publicly traded company since 1981. It was included in the S&P 500 index in 1988 and added to the Dow in 1999. 
As great a wealth creator as HD has been, the bulk of its outperformance has come in only the past decade or so. The collapse of the housing market that precipitated the Great Recession of the late 2000s was a painful period for Home Depot. 
Its resurgence on the back of low mortgage rates – coupled with a shortage of new housing, which prompted homeowners to stay put and renovate, and, more recently, the pandemic – is what truly made investors' fortunes. Including dividends, shares in Home Depot rose about 1,240% over the past decade, according to data from YCharts. The S&P 500 generated a total return of 373% over the same period. 
Wall Street typically ranks HD as one of its favorite Dow stocks, with analysts expecting even more outperformance in the years ahead.

16. JPMorgan Chase
Wealth created: $414.1 billion
Annualized dollar weighted return: 9.8%
Country: U.S.
JPMorgan Chase (JPM) traces its roots all the way back to 1799, when The Manhattan Company was chartered to supply clean water to New York City. 
It has come a long way since. 
Today’s JPMorgan Chase is a sprawling multinational financial powerhouse that ranks as the nation's largest bank by assets. Thanks to decades of mergers and acquisitions, the bank boasts more than 1,200 predecessor institutions, including Chase Manhattan Bank, Bank One, Manufacturers Hanover Trust, Chemical Bank and Bear Stearns, just to name a few. 
Then known as J.P. Morgan & Co., the stock was added to the Dow in 1991 to reflect not only its place of prominence in the financial industry, but its weight in the American business landscape. 
The company name changed to JPMorgan Chase in 2000 after J.P. Morgan & Co. merged with Chase Manhattan. Acquisitions, a well-regarded management team and strength across a wide range of financial businesses has allowed JPM to generate more than $414 billion in wealth for shareholders over the past three decades.

15. Exxon Mobil
Wealth created: $437.1 billion
Annualized dollar weighted return: 10.7%
Country: U.S.
The future looks to be very different from the recent past for Exxon Mobil (XOM). After all, the outlook for fossil fuels and its relevance to the U.S. economy has changed radically since 1990. 
Exxon Mobil's removal from the Dow Jones Industrial Average in 2020 only underscored this new reality. 
Nevertheless, the integrated energy giant sure had a heck of a run. Over the past 30 years, amid cycles of oil booms and oil busts, XOM generated more than $437 billion in wealth. Shareholders can thank the company's policy of regular dividend increases for much of that windfall. Exxon Mobil's dividend payments have grown at an average annual rate of 6.1% over the last 38 years. 
Here's how that's relevant: from 1990 to 2020, XOM stock gained 230% on a price basis alone. Add in the dividends, however, and XOM's total return came to 808%. 
XOM might not repeat as a top stock of the next 30 years, but it could still be a solid buy-and-hold pick if the dividend hikes keep coming.

14. Procter & Gamble
Wealth created: $451.1 billion
Annualized dollar weighted return: 13.1%
Country: U.S.
Procter & Gamble (PG) is another consumer products stock that created outsized wealth for shareholders over the past three decades – even as tech stocks got all the glory. 
Partly that's due to the Dow component's defensive characteristics. Demand for products such as Charmin toilet paper, Crest toothpaste, Tide laundry detergent, Pampers diapers and Gillette razors tends to remain stable in both good times and bad. Well more than 60 consecutive years of annual dividend hikes – PG is a member of the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats – also helped smooth out the ups and downs of the business cycle. 
And make no mistake about how important those rising payouts have been to shareholders' returns. From 1990 to 2020, PG rose 1,500% on a price basis. Include dividends, however, and PG's total return balloons to 3,290%. The S&P 500's total return came to 1,950% over the same period.

13. Nestlé
Wealth created: $478.1 billion
Annualized dollar weighted return: 13.2%
Country: Switzerland
Speaking of consumer products stocks, none has created more wealth over the past three decades than Switzerland's Nestlé (NSRGY). 
It's also no coincidence that the world's largest food company by revenue is a dividend stalwart. This European Dividend Aristocrat has a quarter-century of stable or rising payouts to its name. 
A period of intense international growth from 1990 to 2011 made the sprawling packaged food conglomerate what it is today. Its brands are legion, and approximately 30 of them boast annual sales of at least $1 billion. The company's biggest hitters include Nespresso, Nescafé, Kit Kat, Smarties, Nesquik, Stouffer's, Vittel and Maggi. 
Consumer staples stocks like Nestlé are defensive in nature and tend to lag in up markets. But they also tend to hold up better when the cycle turns. Nestlé serves as proof that when held patiently over several market cycles, defensive dividend payers can create more than their fair share of wealth over the long haul.

12. Berkshire Hathaway
Wealth created: $504.1 billion
Annualized dollar weighted return: 11.7%
Country: U.S.
It should come as no surprise that the greatest value investor of all time would be behind one of the best stocks of the past 30 years. 
Warren Buffett took control of Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B), a struggling textile manufacturer, in the early 1960s. It quickly became clear that U.S. textile manufacturing was in decline, and so Buffett decided to shift gears. By the late 1960s, Buffett had already diversified into banking, insurance and newspaper publishing. 
He never looked back. 
Berkshire is now a holding company comprising dozens of diverse businesses, selling everything from underwear (Fruit of the Loom) to insurance policies (Geico). Key acquisitions since 1990 include the aforementioned Geico, BNSF Railway, Lubrizol, Precision Castparts and General Re. 
Berkshire also has been a vehicle for Buffett to invest in stocks, which he has done shrewdly and successfully. Just have a look at Apple (AAPL). Buffett's single biggest investment, at more than 42% of Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio, makes a starring appearance on our list below.

11. Taiwan Semiconductor
Wealth created: $525.5 billion
Annualized dollar weighted return: 18.3%
Country: Taiwan
The digital revolution is a running theme when it comes to the best stocks of the past three decades, and so it follows almost axiomatically that Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) should make the list. 
The second-largest semiconductor manufacturer by market value (after Nvidia) and revenue (after Intel), TSM was founded in 1987. A decade later, the world's original dedicated semiconductor foundry became the first Taiwanese company to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange. It has since grown into perhaps the single-most important source of chips in the world. Indeed, TSM claims a total global foundry market share of 57%. 
Shareholders can credit the company's outsized wealth creation to a remarkable track record of long-term growth on both its top and bottom lines. Taiwan Semiconductor boasts a compound annual revenue growth rate (CAGR) of 17.2% since 1994. It's earnings CAGR stands at 16.7% over the same span. 
TSM also is proud to note that it has paid a dividend since 2004 – one which it has never reduced.

10. Johnson & Johnson
Wealth created: $535.3 billion
Annualized dollar weighted return: 13.9%
Country: U.S.
Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) cracks the top 10 best stocks of the past 30 years as a three-headed giant. 
Alas, the corporate structure that served investors so well is coming to an end. 
JNJ is set to split off its consumer health business – the one that makes Tylenol, Listerine and Band Aid – from its pharmaceuticals and medical devices divisions. The breakup is meant to free the faster-growth, higher-margin parts of J&J from the drag of its more mature, less profitable operations. 
It remains to be seen how that works out, but the old formula of being a sprawling, defensive dividend grower – this Dividend Aristocrat has lifted its payout annually for nearly 60 years – was indisputably a successful one. 
Thanks in no small part to dividends, Johnson & Johnson’s total return comes to 4,220% from 1990 to 2020, per YCharts, versus 1,950% for the S&P 500. If you were to exclude dividends from this Dow stock’s performance, JNJ would have gained just 2,020% over those same 30 years.

9. Samsung Electronics
Wealth created: $540.6 billion
Annualized dollar weighted return: 20.2%
Country: South Korea
Samsung Electronics (KRX:005930) has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of globalization over the past 30 years. 
The sprawling South Korean technology and industrial conglomerate is engaged in a vast swath of activities. It manufactures consumer electronics, semiconductors, displays, storage systems and sundry other computer parts. The company is also a maker of major household appliances. And it designs software, provides logistics, financing, marketing and consulting services. Samsung is also active in artificial intelligence and cloud-based services. 
As much as Samsung has emerged as a major supplier to the tech sector's supply chain, consumers know it best for its ubiquitous smartphones, televisions and home theater systems. Samsung washers, dryers and refrigerators are likewise major brand ambassadors helping to drive top-line growth. 
But more than any other endeavor, shareholders can credit Samsung's success in mobile devices for cracking this list of the best stocks of the past three decades. Indeed, Samsung handsets are the perennial leader inglobal marketshare.

8. Meta Platforms
Wealth created: $553.7 billion
Annualized dollar weighted return: 30.4%
Country: U.S.
Facebook parent Meta Platforms (FB) got off to a rocky start when it went public under the Facebook name in May 2012 at $38 a share. Technical glitches marred the initial public offering, and the stock traded below the IPO price for more than a year. 
Since then, however, it has been nothing but blue skies – and then some. 
Meta' share price has gained roughly 800% in its relatively short life, creating more than $553 billion in wealth. The S&P 500 is up about 250% on a price basis over the same span. 
Credit the relentless growth of digital advertising, and Meta's effective duopoly with Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) in that industry. As the world’s most popular social media network – with roughly 2.9 billion global monthly active users – advertisers are happy to pay Meta to reach all those eyeballs. 
Indeed, no company on this list has created as much wealth as FB has in such a short period of time.

7. Walmart
Wealth created: $568.7 billion
Annualized dollar weighted return: 13.5%
Country: U.S.
It stands to reason that the world's largest retailer happens to have one of the best-performing stocks over the long haul. 
From humble beginnings as a single discount store, Walmart (WMT) now operates approximately 10,500 retail locations under 48 nameplates in 24 countries, and it employs 2.2 million workers. WMT also happens to be the world's largest company by revenue. 
Analysts project the company's top line to surpass $600 billion before 2025. The evolution of Amazon, in particular, as a competitor prompted Walmart to invest heavily in its e-commerce business, and the returns from those efforts have been nothing short of astonishing. Walmart is now the second largest e-commerce retailer in the U.S. behind Amazon – albeit a distant second. 
A component of the Dow since 1997, Walmart has increased its dividend every year since 1974, and those dividends have really added up. From 1990 through 2020, Walmart stock gained 2,470% on a price basis alone. Include dividends, however, and WMT's total return comes to 3,890%. Both figures easily top the broader market.

6. Tesla
Wealth created: $639.3 billion
Annualized dollar weighted return: 65.4%
Country: U.S.
Tesla's (TSLA) annualized return towers over every other name on this list. But as much wealth as the electric vehicle maker has created in its relatively short life, it has done so with gut-wrenching volatility. 
You can chalk up TSLA's astounding wealth creation and roller-coaster price performance to its mercurial CEO Elon Musk. The market isn't just enthralled with the superiority of Tesla's vehicles and the promise of the EV industry as a whole. It also loves Musk. (Even if he sometimes tweets things that make TSLA stock go nuts.) 
Similar to the late Steve Jobs at Apple, Musk's showmanship, close identification with the company and his evident genius is a major selling point. 
Known as Tesla Motors when it went public in 2010, the company adopted its current moniker in 2017 to reflect an expansion into lithium ion batteries and solar energy. 
Although TSLA has had some stumbles over the years – production snafus, delivery shortfalls – the hype and promise of the Musk-backed firm has led the market essentially to abandon normal valuation metrics. Tesla has created an astonishing level of wealth so far, and investors seemingly just price shares for more of the same.

5. Tencent
Wealth created: $691.7 billion
Annualized dollar weighted return: 48.1%
Country: China
Tencent (TCEHY), the Chinese multinational technology conglomerate, has delivered an annualized dollar-weighted return of more than 48% over the past three decades. Investors can thank the company's sprawling operations in the world's largest consumer market for those eye-popping results.
Founded in 1998, Tencent is the world's largest vendor of video games, and has massive footprints in social media, music, e-commerce, payments systems, venture capital and much, much more. A small sample of the firm's hit products include instant-messaging platform Tencent QQ, multiplayer online battle arena game Honor of Kings, and QQ Music, a streaming music service. 
With a current market value in excess of U.S. $600 billion, Tencent is China’s most valuable company and a top-10 most valuable stock in the world.
Shares in Tencent, which trade over the counter in the U.S. as American depositary receipt (ADRs), have soared 1,530% on a price basis over the past 10 years. The S&P 500 gained about 290% over the same span.

4. Alphabet
Wealth created: $979.1 billion
Annualized dollar weighted return: 19.3%
Country: U.S.
Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) has certainly made the most of its relatively short time as a publicly traded company. 
Shares of what was then known as Google – the corporate name was changed to Alphabet in 2015 – were initially offered to the public less than 20 years ago. And by the end of the first trading day in 2004, the company was worth $27 billion. Today, Alphabet has a market value of about $2 trillion. 
The Google search engine is Alphabet's most important business, but not its only one, thus the corporate name change. Alphabet is also home to self-driving car startup Waymo; Nest Labs, a developer of gadgets for the Internet of Things; and X, which describes itself as a ""moonshot factory"" trying to invent technologies that will make the world a ""radically better place."" 
The aforementioned digital-ad duopoly with Facebook still drives the bulk of GOOGL's business, which critics say makes Alphabet a ""one-trick pony."" But after creating nearly $980 billion in wealth in less than two decades, even bears have to concede it has been one heck of a trick.

3. Amazon.com
Wealth created: $1.57 trillion
Annualized dollar weighted return: 31.1%
Country: U.S.
Amazon.com (AMZN), which began life as a modest website for book buyers, went public in 1997 and has since created nearly $1.6 trillion in value for shareholders. The stock’s 31.1% annualized return is among the highest on this list. The performance is all the more remarkable considering most of the best stocks of all time goose their returns by paying out generous dividends for decades. 
Amazon's emergence as the nation’s largest e-commerce company is only part of the story behind its extraordinary wealth creation. The firm is a giant in the fast-growing industry of cloud-based services, and a leader in streaming media, content creation and even digital advertising. 
Amazon continues to make huge strides in the analog retail world too. For example, it owns the Whole Foods grocery store chain and built its own freight and logistics operations. The latter operations comprise a vast assemblage of distribution centers, as well as fleets of commercial aircraft and trucks. 
With its relentless focus on investment and expansion, analysts expect Amazon to continue to deliver outsized growth for the foreseeable future.

2. Microsoft
Wealth created: $1.91 trillion
Annualized dollar weighted return: 19.2%
Country: U.S.
Not long ago, Microsoft's (MSFT) glory days looked to be behind it as sales of desktop PCs slipped into a seemingly irreversible decline amid the consumer shift to mobile technology. Although the dot-com days of the 1990s minted many a ""Microsoft millionaire,"" the aftermath of the tech bust led MSFT stock to trade mostly sideways for a decade. 
But the past 10 years have been nothing short of a renaissance for the software giant. 
Microsoft's focus on enterprise customers and – most importantly – its shift to selling cloud-based services such as Azure and Office 365 have been an astounding success. Today, Microsoft is a dominant player in cloud computing, and the stock price shows it. Shares in Microsoft, which joined the Dow in 1999 at the height of the dot-com boom, generated a total return of 57,730% from 1990 to 2020. The S&P 500's total return comes to a mere 1,950% over the same span. 
Along the way, Microsoft created $1.91 trillion in wealth for shareholders, good for an annualized return of more than 19%.
Getty Images
1. Apple
Wealth created: $2.67 trillion
Annualized dollar weighted return: 23.5%
Country: U.S.
To say that Apple (AAPL) had a better time of it than Microsoft in the decade following the bursting of the tech bubble is quite an understatement. 
True, AAPL stock traded sideways for the first few years of the 21st century, but an explosion of innovation soon put an end to that. Under the visionary leadership of the late Steve Jobs, Apple essentially reinvented itself for the mobile age, launching revolutionary gadgets such as the iPod, MacBook and iPad. 
But what really set Apple on its course to becoming the world's largest publicly traded company – and the greatest wealth creator of the past 30 years – was the 2007 debut of the iPhone. 
Today, Apple isn't just a purveyor of gadgets; it sells an entire ecosystem of personal consumer electronics and related services. And it's a sticky ecosystem, at that. No less an eminence than Warren Buffett has called the iPhone maker Berkshire Hathaway's ""third business,"" noting Apple fans' fantastic brand loyalty as one reason for being all-in on the stock. (Apple accounts for more than 40% of the value of Berkshire's equity portfolio.) 
The iconic tech firm was added to the Dow Jones Industrial Average in 2015, replacing AT&T (T).

2021-11-19 00:00:00+00:00,Data Center Growth Is Still the Top Reason to Buy Nvidia Stock Now,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/data-center-growth-is-still-the-top-reason-to-buy-nvidia-stock-now,,,"Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) hit another one out of the park on its fiscal 2022 third-quarter update for the three months ended Oct. 31, 2021. Total revenue of $7.1 billion in the quarter represented a 50% year-over-year increase, and operating income of $2.7 billion (that's right, a nearly-40% operating profit margin) was up 91% year over year.
The company's success in recent years is thanks in large part to a massive video game upgrade cycle as gamers adopt Nvidia's latest RTX 30 series GPUs (graphics processing units). Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD), which has long played second fiddle to Nvidia in the GPU space, has been making hay as well, and rival Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) wants in on the party too and is releasing a stand-alone gaming GPU early in 2022.
Intel might be able to capture a slice of the GPU gaming market, though I would be shocked if anyone dethrones Nvidia anytime soon on this front. However, it's the massive data center industry that still makes Nvidia a great buy for the long haul right now.
Image source: Getty Images.
GPUs march into the computing unit of the cloud
Of the $7.1 billion haul Nvidia took in in Q3, just over $2.9 billion of the revenue came from data centers, up 55% from a year ago and up 24% from the last quarter. These are big numbers, but the gaming segment was still Nvidia's largest revenue line item at $3.2 billion (a 42% year-over-year increase).
While video games remain Nvidia's bread and butter and will continue to grow over time, data centers are still a massive opportunity. Intel, by far the largest chip company by annual revenue, illustrates it best. Its Data Center Group alone made $6.5 billion in sales in Q3. With cloud and new high-performance computing use cases ramping up, the data center industry isn't going to get smaller anytime soon.
And that's where the investment thesis for Nvidia still makes sense. GPUs are still early on in implementation in data centers. Central processing units (CPUs), Intel's historical forte, are still necessary in the modern data center computing unit. But complex workloads like AI are better handled by the hardware Nvidia specializes in. Plus, while Intel is taking a shot at Nvidia's gaming business with its new GPU design, Nvidia's own disruption of Intel's data center turf is already underway with a new lineup of data processing units (DPUs) that handle the flow of information) and upcoming CPUs (for general-purpose workloads).
Software makes things even more interesting
Nvidia's growing suite of hardware is the real deal, but software is what often differentiates the company from its semiconductor peers. You see, Nvidia has long been billing itself as an integrated company that not only designs chips, but also puts together extensive software kits to make using its hardware even easier. As CEO Jensen Huang said on the Q3earnings call ""chips are enablers, they don't create markets; software creates markets."" Basically, hardware is designed to enable a use case that has already been imagined as a software service.
Two recent product launches highlight the massive long-term potential of software for this chip company. First, Nvidia AI Enterprise, a software suite of AI and analytics tools for use on VMware's vSphere cloud computing platform. As more firms try to get started implementing AI in their operations, AI Enterprise could become a lucrative business line for Nvidia.
Second, the ""metaverse,"" that virtual embodiment of the digital world that Meta Platforms (formerly Facebook) recently shined a light on. Nvidia's Omniverse actually came before Facebook's headline-grabbing rebrand, and its potential is massive -- and could be realized sooner than you think. Huang discussed how Nvidia thinks of companies and the work done with them as individual ""worlds."" For example, a designer using Adobe software is working in the Adobe ""world,"" but that designer might work at an automaker -- like say BMW, which has its own ""world"" of data, content, and work.
Omniverse was designed to be a connector of these disparate digital worlds to help unify the ""metaverse"" into one big collective space. Think of it like a digital collaboration tool, as well as a way to create a digital twin of real-world locations that can be optimized and worked on virtually. Omniverse was recently made available to nearly 3 million developers. Just one tool within this suite, Omniverse Avatar, is being used by over 70,000 creators already.
Licensed out at about $1,000 per year per user, Omniverse Avatar alone could be a big deal. Any software-based bot -- like a virtual assistant in a car, a restaurant ordering system or retail checkout kiosk, or an online customer service video bot -- can get its own virtual avatar. Huang and company foresee millions of these virtual assistants being a possibility one day soon. Suffice to say Omniverse has vast income-earning potential for Nvidia.
All of these cloud capabilities are of course powered by a data center, and Nvidia GPUs and related hardware are making it happen. The company foresees revenue growing another 48% year-over-year in Q4, but it's this ultra long-term data center and cloud computing potential that still make the stock a buy right now.

2021-11-15 00:00:00+00:00,7 Stocks to Buy That Will Make You Rich by 2030,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/7-stocks-to-buy-that-will-make-you-rich-by-2030,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Investors who seek a quick path to wealth will often fail. Speculators risk reacting too emotionally if a stock drops while they watch its movements like a hawk. Conversely, investors who search for stocks to buy and hold for the very long term will have more patience.
Taking the time to research a company’s prospects will lead to better returns. Look for companies that build a strong business plan to carry through over several years. The realistic ones will explain the near-term risks, too.
7 Stocks to Buy With Stacks of Free Cash Flow
Chosen across several sectors, these seven stocks to buy will make you rich by 2030 if management grows revenues at current rates:
Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT)
Coinbase Global (NASDAQ:COIN)
Intel (NASDAQ:INTC)
Altria Group (NYSE:MO)
Novartis (NYSE:NVS)
Pfizer (NYSE:PFE)
StoneCo (NASDAQ:STNE)
Quality, value, and growth scores vary among the selected stocks.

As shown above, all of the companies have a strong quality score. Only the growth and valuation scores vary. For example, Intel and Applied Materials are semiconductor companies with vastly different near-term prospects. Meanwhile, Altria has the lowest overall scores but the highest dividend yield. StoneCo is trading far below its 52-week high, creating a rare entry point for investors.
Stocks to Buy: Applied Materials (AMAT)

Applied Materials pays a modest quarterly dividend of 24 cents. Its leadership in the semiconductor capital equipment sector will reward shareholders.
The company has diversified into the advanced display-manufacturing segment. Also, it is in a strong position to grow in the advanced packaging market.
AMAT accelerated its growth after embracing 3D NAND production in 2014. With the chip shortage fueling unfilled sales, AMAT’s wafer fabbrication equipment (WFE) business will outgrow the semiconductor industry.
The digital transformation of the global economy is a big catalyst for AMAT stock. Large companies need to invest more to compete, and will need Applied Materials’ products to survive.
In the near term, its dynamic random access memory (DRAM) tech will perform well. The company will benefit from stronger sales in the second half of the year compared to the first.
Applied Materials’ NAND products, which are used in storage, saw weaker sales than its DRAM offerings. Still, demand next year and beyond for NAND is healthy.
Coinbase Global (COIN)

Cryptocurrency platform Coinbase will attract a considerable number of customers in the coming decade. Despite rare moments of user dissatisfaction, the site genuinely wants to teach the public about cryptocurrency investing. To address the former issue, Coinbase acquired Agara, an Indian artificial intelligence startup, to expand and automate customer service capabilities.
Coinbase has a good problem: it has too much customer growth. It cannot handle the influx and needs to strengthen support levels. As customers deposit more assets and complete more transactions, Coinbase’s revenue will grow.
On Oct. 19, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) picked the platform to power crypto custody for Novi, its digital wallet. In this pilot study, users can acquire Pax Dollar (CCC:USDP-USD) and Novi will hold it on deposit with Coinbase Custody. If requested, Novi users may transfer USDP between each other in an instant.
Facebook is a social networking giant. Getting its support will convince customers to join Coinbase rather than its competitors.
7 Best Cryptocurrencies That Could Hit New Highs Soon
Wall Street analysts think COIN stock trades with minimal upside ahead. Coinbase may disprove them. As revenue grows over the next decade, the stock will reward its shareholders.
Stocks to Buy: Intel (INTC)

Intel is suffering from low growth as it loses its foothold in the desktop and server markets. However, that is changing quickly. Rallying ahead of its quarterly earnings report and then slumping, as it always does, Intel is a value stock.
The giant lost its way when rivals found growth in mobile processor development. Then, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) took Intel’s desktop market through its Ryzen processor product line. AMD’s Epyc also outperforms Intel’s comparable chip line, Xeon.
But Intel’s refreshed 12th generation Alder Lake processor shows promise. Tech review sites are posting very high ratings. Intel’s architecture for Alder Lake is creative, featuring a hybrid core design that provides efficiency and solid performance. Its P-cores clock up to 5.2 gigahertz (GHz), while its E-cores run at a maximum of 3.9 GHz.
The company needs to solidify support for the new chip and developments of its graphics card. To ensure this, CEO Pat Gelsinger noted Intel will communicate better with “a developer-first approach.”
Altria Group (MO)
Source: Kristi Blokhin / Shutterstock.com
In the third quarter, Altria posted non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.22. Revenue fell by 2.6% year-over-year (YOY) to $5.53 billion.
Markets did not appreciate the company raising the lower end of its full-year 2021 guidance. It expects EPS in the range of $4.58 to $4.62.
The 5% to 6% EPS growth over 2020 does not show an obvious path to wealth by 2030. Yet the dividend of 90 cents per quarter is after a 5% hike. Expect Altria’s strong cash flow to allow management to raise dividends regularly.
Some investors view tobacco as an unattractive investment. But people who smoke still need to buy the company’s products. Plus, Altria has a discount segment that is growing. It is careful not to gouge price-sensitive customers, especially its premium brands.
7 F-Rated Stocks to Sell Before We Reach Christmas
Altria is embracing e-vapor, an alternative to tobacco that is expected to grow in popularity over the next decade. It estimated the total category volume of these products increased 17% from last year. If the future improves for this segment, Altria’s stock will rise and reward investors.
Stocks to Buy: Novartis (NVS)

In the third quarter, Novartis posted sales growing by 6% from last year to $13 billion. For 2021, expectations of net sales growth in the low- to mid-single-digit percentages will not impress investors seeking wealth. Still, its Cosentyx and Entresto drugs will add billions in revenue.
Cosentyx is a monoclonal antibody that treats psoriasis, ankylosing spondylitis and psoriatic arthritis. Peak sales could reach $7 billion for the drug. Meanwhile, Entresto is a blood pressure medication that could bring in $5 billion in revenue.
NVS stock is on sale because the company faces pressure in its near-term top-line growth. The lowered expectations hurt the share price, creating a better price for value investors.
Eventually, Novartis will post positive developments for products like its CAR-T cancer therapy. Investors do not yet now when Novartis will post such great news, but when it does, the stock will climb abruptly. Instead of timing those events, investors should look at the stock now while the market ignores it.
Pfizer (PFE)

After peaking at more than $50 this summer, Pfizer descended for no reason. Then, investors bid shares higher by 10% early in November when it announced results for its antiviral Covid pill, Paxlovid.
Besides its generous revenue split with BioNTech (NASDAQ:BNTX) for sales of the Covid vaccine (it expects at least $65 billion in 2022), the Covid pill shows promise. If taken within three days of symptom onset, Paxlovid reduced hospitalization by 89% compared to a placebo.
While lockdowns and business closures have ended in many places, the pandemic is not yet over. Even after the worst of it passes, the virus will linger in communities for at least the next few years.
If approved, Pfizer’s pill gives hospitals and doctors another weapon to fight the virus. CEO Albert Bourla said the study news “is a real game-changer in the global efforts to halt the devastation of this pandemic.”
7 Stocks to Buy That Could Be the Next Trillion-Dollar Company 
Pfizer may realize billions in revenue within the next few months. More countries will approve Paxlovid, increasing both the addressable market and revenue for Pfizer.
Stocks to Buy: StoneCo (STNE)
Source: Shutterstock
After topping $95, StoneCo fell steadily in 2021. The leading provider of financial technology solutions in Brazil posted an 8.1% YOY decline in revenue.
StoneCo also posted a Q2 2021 loss. Despite a total payment volume of 60.4 billion Brazilian Reals, up 58.6% YOY, the company faces technology challenges. In the short term, its new registry system has experienced technical delays. It also suspended Take Rate, which hurt its adjusted net margin outlook for the year.
The uncertainty spooked investors, sending the stock to lows. Cautious investors may build a position from here but risk further downside ahead.
Looking beyond the quarter, StoneCo is of great importance to the merchant community in Brazil. The company will keep winning market share in the small and midsized business space. StoneCo is accustomed to the competition and will manage new products to sustain growth.
The 35% of clients that are not paying interest is a short-term headwind. Non-performing loans are also on the rise. In its Q2earnings call company executives stated that under the new regulatory framework, it would increase its reserves. Customers will repay their loans as cash flow recovers and from there, its income will bounce back.

2021-11-13 00:00:00+00:00,"As Supply Chain Woes Plague Apple, When's the Best Time to Buy?",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/as-supply-chain-woes-plague-apple-whens-the-best-time-to-buy-2021-11-13,,,"The supply chain, still smarting from a global pandemic and labor shortage, threatens to derail some holiday cheer this year. Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL) Oct. 28 earnings report delivered the harsh reality that the company is struggling to get the internal chips and necessary components for top new products. With electronics supplies low going into Q4, it seems the Grinch has his eyes on Christmas at Apple this holiday season. But a bumpy sleigh-ride for Apple this winter could mean cost-averaging opportunities for savvy, long-term investors.
What is going on with the supply chain?
This year has already seen fallout from continual supply chain crises arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, and further trouble owing to the Suez Canal blockage in March. Those cascading events put a real pinch on companies that source materials worldwide, and which manufacture in China or other areas where labor costs are low.
Major semiconductor manufacturers rely heavily on raw materials from distant shores, and in its most recentearnings call Apple addressed how the chip shortage combined with supply chain disruptions to affect the company's previous quarter. CEO Tim Cook bet heavily on Apple's reliance on Foxconn and other manufacturers' ability to get necessary materials from around the world. But shipping delays and COVID-19 woes kept Apple's key suppliers from delivering necessary components, including casings, cameras, and critical internal chips and plastics.
Image source: Getty Images.
How might that weigh on Apple stock prices in Q4?
Apple's new product launches should have driven much higher profits, but the company's struggles to get materials to the factories, and completed products, cost it somewhere around $6 billion, according to Cook during theearnings call ""Demand was very robust,"" the CEO stated, but without an appropriate supply, the retailers just couldn't deliver expected sales figures. This led Apple to barely eke out anticipated profits and drove its Q4 expectations lower.
Stores are having real trouble keeping the new iPhone 13 and Apple Watch Series 7 in stock, and Macbooks are backordered months behind delivery. In all likelihood, the final quarter of 2021 will show similar struggles. The subsequent earnings report at the end of January, the one most impacted by holiday sales, could potentially even deliver news of a missed revised earnings mark, something the company barely avoided in late October.
Is now the time to buy a competitor?
Samsung, Apple's largest direct competitor in the smartphone market, has been struggling to keep up supply all year. It was hit with supply chain problems much earlier than Apple was, leaving Samsung in a poor place to capitalize on its rival's Christmas woes.
Samsung's own chip production, primarily server DRAM and memory NAND chips, continues to drive company profits, but its smartphone division has not yet managed to capitalize on the challenges facing Apple. Supply chain failures of raw materials and the logistics capacity to transport finished goods remain an ongoing issue for Samsung going into the close of the year.
Xaomi, OPPO, vivo, and other global competitors also face similar market conditions. Market share may not pass much between the big leaders, but whoever can most effectively move products from raw materials to final delivery has a chance to be a big winner this holiday season.
Look toward Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales for an early indicator of who can get goods on the shelves at the start of the season. But the real proof in the Christmas pudding will be December's holiday numbers. The National Retail Federation is likely to provide a great bellwether for these events as the season progresses.
A wish list for next year?
Apple signaled that it may have some relief on the way, as chip manufacturers work to address delivery concerns and scale up production. The company has invested heavily in its own chip design and proprietary production following its split with Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) last year.

While there's no immediate end in sight to supply chain woes, major chipmakers including Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Intel are beginning to adjust to this ""new normal,"" prioritizing top players and ramping up production in the areas where they are needed most.
Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger believes ""the chip shortage is at its worst right now. It will get incrementally better as we go through '22, but we expect the shortage to persist into 2023. It just takes that long to build capacity."" Barring any major news out of its logistics teams or manufacturing suppliers, Apple is likely stuck in the same rut as it was leading up to the Octoberearnings call
When might be the best time to buy?
The holiday season has traditionally been very good for Apple, but it's likely that the next quarterly report will show the same issues as the previous one. The company is strong and in no real risk of collapse, but these quarterly difficulties may help bring prices down and allow for cost-averaging or even quick pickup of Apple shares at bargain-bin prices before the inevitable rebound, as manufacturers shift to support the biggest players over the next two years.

Late in Apple's fourth quarter, as sales numbers begin to trickle in, or even immediately following the nextearnings callmight be the best time to swoop in and grab Apple stock before its highly probable recovery. Also, holding onto Apple through the long winter instead of selling on a predictably soft earnings report can keep losses at bay. One investor's Grinch might just be another's roast beast.

Matt Frankel: Intel, I am just honestly not interested in investing in a turnaround story in my dividend portfolio. Intel is very much a turnaround story right now. Their sales actually declined year-over-year, which very few tech stocks have seen sales decline.
Jason Hall: They just reported third quarter, it was up 5%.
Frankel: Sales down 1% year-over-year.
Hall: Tell you why, they divested part of their business and they adjusted that part that's no longer going to report out, so 5% of the core business. But yes, you're absolutely right.
Frankel: Whatever the case. You see now these other tech stocks were doubling sales year-over-year.
Hall: Absolutely. Absolutely. Your point, is actually it's kind of true, right? They divested something.
Frankel: You see, like even these big tech companies like Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) or Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) produce high-growth rates over these past years. Intel, the main problem I have is their turnaround story to capitalize on things like artificial intelligence and augmented reality and things like that, which they want to capitalize on.
It's going to take longer and cost more money than they originally thought. Just to kind of give you an example, they say they're going to spend between $25 and $28 billion dollars on capital investments next year. The highest they've ever spent in a single year has been $16 billion to date. They are expecting it to go up beyond 2022. They're expecting this turnaround to be very expensive. If successful, they see a $1 trillion market opportunity by 2030.
Now that's not going to be all theirs and it's going to cost them in the hundreds of billions to capitalize on it. You guys are clearly more bullish on Intel than me. I'm curious to find out why you guys ranked this, I think third and fourth [out of 10 dividend stocks], while I ranked this tenth.
Jon Quast: I don't think I'm bullish anymore Matt. Thank you.
Frankel: [laughs] I ruined it for you.
Hall: Jon, do you want to go first? I'll go. Go ahead.
Quast: I will just I will just say the reason that I did rank it so high is because to me, it is so cheap and I know that there's such a thing as a value trap. You don't want to invest in a stock just because of a cheap valuation. What matters is not what has happened, but what will happen going forward and that is the case with Intel as well. When I look at the semiconductor industry though, when I see what's ahead for that industry, it is really hard for me to discount any player in the space -- Intel included, despite past under performance. With a new plan in place, given the cheap valuation, it's really hard for me to say: ""you can't--"" like, ""stay away from Intel."" It's hard for me to come to that conclusion. But to Matt's point, it makes perfect sense what he's saying.
Frankel: If you see the chart on your screen right now, I can't name any other big tech stocks that have performed so poorly against the S&P 500 in the past five years.
Hall: Yes. There's no doubt about that and I will be blunt. One of the reasons I'm so interested in Intel and recently bought Intel is because of that chart you showed. The reason Intel is in that boat is because Intel did largely what Microsoft did for a long time in that it focused so much on its core business that it ignored all of the, not just the threats to it, but also the opportunities that existed. Right? Thinking about, like you said, the way you lead it Matt, I love it. You don't want to own a turnaround story in your dividend portfolio. That makes a tremendous, tremendous amount of sense.
Here's where I stand with Intel and the reason why I really believe in this turnaround story. First of all, I gets what Jon was talking about, talking about everything that's going on with the semiconductor industry. If you think about the enormous tailwinds, think about the hundreds of billions of dollars that have to be spent to expand capacity for what's to come. It is a gigantic tailwind. Then you take with that Intel's core business, that's actually still pretty important. That's it's fully integrated business, where it designs the chips and it tells its customers, OK, these are the chips, these are what they can do. And there's some interaction, right, to make sure like feature sets and that sort of thing. But basically it says, OK, here's what we have. How many do you want?
Then they buy them and they stick them in their PCs or their portable computers or they stick them in their data-centers or whatever. Then they have the foundry right where they, they do all of the manufacturing, right. They're fully vertically integrated. That's still a really important business. It generated, I don't know, $30 billion of operating cash over the past year. That's a pretty, pretty good business to be in to be a troubled business. But then here's the next part that has me a believer. Pat Gelsinger was brought on earlier this year as the CEO. He sees this enormous opportunity that is largely today Taiwan Semi (NYSE: TSM) and Samsung (OTC: SSNLF).
What is that opportunity? It's everybody else in the world that wants a chip that wants it for a specific purpose, that Intel is not going to make. Maybe they want to design it themselves, maybe they want to customize it a little bit. It's this massive opportunity to be fabless -- to design the chip and then have somebody make it. Now Intel has stood up this business that has a leader that reports directly to the CEO. They're not going to have these problems like Microsoft had where you have these internal silos that were fighting over resources and the political game that got in the way. They're not fighting for those resources anymore. They're looking at what the largest semiconductor manufacturers in the world that are not Intel are doing and seeing this huge opportunity.
I think in five years, this is going to be a different business than it is today. Their core business is still going to be really important. But five years from now, they will have invested, they will have stood things up, they will have people that are designing on their X86 architecture, that are using Intel, to make the processors that they want. I fully believe in it. It doesn't hurt that they're only paying out like 30% of their cash flows for the dividend right now, right? I think it's safer than we might realize.

2021-11-12 00:00:00+00:00,We Did The Math IWX Can Go To $76,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/we-did-the-math-iwx-can-go-to-%2476-2021-11-12,,,"Looking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at ETF Channel, we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. For the iShares Russell Top 200 Value ETF (Symbol: IWX), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $76.15 per unit.
With IWX trading at a recent price near $69.32 per unit, that means that analysts see 9.86% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of IWX's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are Intel Corp (Symbol: INTC), Charter Communications Inc (Symbol: CHTR), and Texas Instruments Inc. (Symbol: TXN). Although INTC has traded at a recent price of $50.53/share, the average analyst target is 13.13% higher at $57.17/share. Similarly, CHTR has 12.67% upside from the recent share price of $694.21 if the average analyst target price of $782.20/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting TXN to reach a target price of $212.20/share, which is 12.51% above the recent price of $188.60. Below is a twelve month price history chart comparing the stock performance of INTC, CHTR, and TXN:
Below is a summary table of the current analyst target prices discussed above:
NAME SYMBOL RECENT PRICE AVG. ANALYST 12-MO. TARGET % UPSIDE TO TARGET
iShares Russell Top 200 Value ETF IWX $69.32 $76.15 9.86%

Charter Communications Inc CHTR $694.21 $782.20 12.67%
Texas Instruments Inc. TXN $188.60 $212.20 12.51%
Are analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past. These are questions that require further investor research.

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.

2021-11-11 00:00:00+00:00,4 Underperforming Stocks to Buy for a Reversal Rally,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/4-underperforming-stocks-to-buy-for-a-reversal-rally-2021-11-11,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Underperforming stocks are easy to miss in a market like this. In general, there is significant market focus on hot stocks. It makes sense to ride on positive investor sentiment, a technical break-out and positive business news.
At the same time, the fear of missing out on a big rally often leads to investors getting trapped at higher levels. Earlier this year, it didn’t take time for Lucid (NASDAQ:LCID) stock to correct from $65 to $20. This risk is minimal when investors consider underperforming stocks. In particular, at a time when broad market valuations look stretched.
Typically, underperforming stocks would be names that have delivered returns lower than the index return. Or returns that are lower than peer group stocks. The reasons can be company specific challenges or industry headwinds.

I want to focus primarily on high-quality names that have been among the list of underperforming stocks. Sooner or later, the focus will be on these stocks as markets look for value. I have also discussed one underperforming penny stock, which can possibly double at the blink of an eye.
Let’s dig deeper into the fundamentals of these underperforming stocks.
Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC)
Nio (NYSE:NIO)
Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT)

4 Underperforming Stocks to Buy: Intel Corporation (INTC)
Source: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com
For year-to-date 2021, INTC stock has been largely sideways. The stock trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of less than 10. Additionally, INTC stock offers investors a healthy dividend yield of 2.7%. I believe that at current valuations, a break-out on the upside is imminent.
An important point to note is that Intel is in a period of high capital expenditure. The company’s focus on investment and innovation is likely to deliver results in the next few years.
Intel has already committed to invest $20 billion in two state-of-art semi-conductor foundries in Arizona. For 2021, Intel has committed to invest $18 to $19 billion. Even after this investment, Intel expects a free cash flow of $12 billion.
Furthermore, for 2022, the company has guided for capital expenditure (mid-range) of $26.5 billion. Clearly, the company is setting stage for future growth.
The semi-conductor segment is likely to remain the cash flow driver. However, Intel has increasingly focused on emerging segments such as the Internet of Things. In the next few years, IoT is likely to be a key growth driver.
With this outlook, INTC stock looks poised for a rally. Long-term investors can consider exposure at current levels. I would also not be surprised with a sharp rally in the near term.
Nio (NIO)

In the recent past, electric vehicle stocks like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Lucid Motors have surged. However, Nio stock has been a true underperformer. Over a 12-month period, the stock has been essentially flat, off just 8%.
However, I believe that a strong rally is impending and there are several possible catalysts. It’s worth noting that Nio has already initiated international expansion. The company is likely to expand in several European countries in the coming quarters. This will help in boosting medium-term vehicle deliveries.
Nio also has a strong pipeline of new launches. For 2022, the company plans to launch three new models. This will include the company’s second sedan, ET5.
7 Superstocks That Have Returned Over 10,000% in 30 Years
Another point worth noting is that Nio reported cash and equivalents of $7.5 billion as of Q2 2021. Recently, the company announced an at-the-market offering of $2.0 billion. With a strong cash buffer, the company seems fully financed for the next 12-24 months.
In addition to company-specific factors, the electric vehicle industry has positive tailwinds for the next decade. Even with intensifying competition, there is ample scope for sustained growth.
For Nio, as vehicle deliveries increase, vehicle level margin expansion has followed. Once operating and free cash flows accelerate, Nio stock has meaningful upside potential.

As markets look for value, I would not be surprised if the stock delivers 10% to 20% returns in the near term.
According to analyst estimates, LMT stock has an average price target of $383.88. This would imply an upside from current levels around $337.
From a business perspective, Lockheed Martin has stable cash flow visibility for the coming years. As of Q3 2021, the company reported an order backlog of $135 billion. With this backlog, Lockheed expects operating cash flow in excess of $8.0 billion for 2021 and 2022.
An important point to note is that LMT stock has an annualized dividend of $11.2. Dividends are sustainable considering the backlog and cash flow outlook.
I also like the fact that LMT stock is a low-beta name. In general, defense stocks are immune from economic shocks. Even during the pandemic year, global defense spending increased. With Lockheed increasingly getting orders from outside the United States, the long-term outlook seems bright.
Sundial Growers (SNDL)

SNDL stock has been among the underperforming penny stocks. After being sideways to lower in the last six months, the stock seems poised for a rally.
One reason for the stock remaining depressed is a massive equity dilution. However, Sundial has been utilizing the cash buffer for organic and acquisition-driven growth.
In the investment division, Sundial has already committed to invest $588 million in the joint venture with SAF Group. The joint venture is targeting equity, debt and hybrid investments in the global cannabis industry. For the first half of 2021, Sundial reported revenue of $25.2 million from the investment portfolio.
Further, Sundial also has a portfolio of cannabis brands. With the company’s acquisition of Spiritleaf and Nova Cannabis retail network, Sundial is vertically integrated with a strong presence in Canada. As the sale of branded products increase, the company is positioned for EBITDA margin expansion.
The global cannabis market was worth approximately $20 billion in 2020. Sundial expects the market size to increase to $47 billion by 2025.
Given the growth outlook, there is likely to be ample opportunities for Sundial to expand its investment portfolio. Further, with a focus on having a narrow, but quality SKU, the company’s branded portfolio is likely to deliver results.

At Intel Corp (Symbol: INTC), 8 different insiders purchased 96,953 shares at an average price of $48.95/share, for a total of $4.75M, with the most recent purchase on October 28, 2021.
Presumably the only reason an insider would take their hard-earned cash and use it to buy stock of their company in the open market, is that they expect to make money. So when multiple insiders all decide to make purchases around the same time, it could be a strong indication that the stock is undervalued. Below is a table summarizing the insider buys that make up this ""cluster"":

Nov 10 (Reuters) - Shoppers could be looking at an expensive Christmas as supply chain snafus force companies to make and deliver their latest higher margin electronic gadgets to market faster, leaving fewer cheaper options to put under the tree.
Top electronic brands are using their best resources to navigate a chip shortage that has curtailed the production of goods across pricing ranges because of logistic issues, a tight labor market and closed factories due to pandemic lockdowns in parts of Asia.
Various websites are showing that cheaper products have longer wait times for delivery, while expensive items are available sooner.
""If vendors choose which device models they want to manufacture when they have limited access to chips then they'll generally go to the higher end, as they can better maximize their profits,"" ABI Research analyst Filomena Iovino said.
Apple Inc AAPL.O and Microsoft Corp MSFT.O have hoisted bright red banners on their websites telling online shoppers to get their holiday presents for delivery as soon as possible on some of their newer, more expensive products.
An $800, 11-inch iPad Pro can be delivered as soon as Nov. 17, but the cheaper and newer $330 entry-level iPad could take nearly a month or more.
Similarly, a $1,759 Hermes Apple Watch 7 will reach customers by early December, but the $400 Apple Watch will take longer.
Samsung will also ship the latest $1,900 Galaxy Z Fold a week sooner than the $1,200 S21 Ultra. Both are loaded with the latest 5G chips.
Qualcomm Inc QCOM.O, which makes high-end 5G-enabled chips for Apple and many top Android phones, said its customers were focusing on the premium and high-tier devices.
""Since there are less of the cheaper phones, the cheaper phones aren't going to be as discounted as we normally see,"" said Runar Bjørhovde, an analyst with research firm Canalys.
While global smartphone shipments declined due to component shortages in the third quarter, strong shipments of mid-to high-end smartphones drove record third-quarter revenue of over $100 billion, according to Counterpoint.
Smartphones are expected to be priced at an average of $410 this holiday quarter, up from $376 in the prior quarter and $395 last year. Average selling prices of laptops are expected to jump 8% to $830 for the holiday quarter, according to IDC.
GoPro Inc GPRO.O, which last quarter shifted production to focus on high-margin action cameras, said earlier this month that consumers were buying cameras at the top end of its line-up priced more than $300.
Even laptop makers, who rely on factories in Asia for a majority of their components, have shifted production of the cheaper 11"" Chromebooks to higher-end 14"" and 15"" variants, IDC analyst Bryan Ma said.
""It works during a supply-constrained environment since consumers don't have any other choice ... So when supply eventually catches up to demand, manufacturers can put more production toward lower-end products to appeal to more price-sensitive users,"" Ma said.

There’s a lot of current news to digest related to Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock. Among the news, Nvidia will release Q3 earnings on Nov. 17. That will interest investors looking to time a purchase around that release, spiking their curiosity.
NVDA) parked."" width=""300"" height=""169"">

Further, Nvidia had a very strong October and its market capitalization has risen steadily. In fact, it recently eclipsed Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A, NYSE:BRK.B) to become the seventh-largest publicly traded company. 
Let’s begin by looking at where estimates put Nvidia’s earnings numbers in the coming weeks. 
Q3 Expectations
Based on anticipated revenue figures for Nvidia over the next few quarters I assume many investors will be attempting to find an ideal time to establish a position in NVDA stock. Based on revenue expectations listed on Yahoo! Finance, Nvidia will continue to grow between Q3 and Q4, even though it may appear otherwise. 
The company is anticipated to report $6.82 billion in revenues on Nov. 17. That’s a strong figure on a year-over-year basis: Nvidia reported $4.726 billion in Q3 a year prior. 
But the same set of prognostications suggest that the company will record approximately $6.81 billion in revenues in Q4. 
In other words, Nvidia is set to report Q3 revenue growth of 44.31% on Nov. 17. That is very impressive indeed. However, Nvidia is also predicted to report $6.81 billion in revenue in Q4. If that materializes it will represent a 0.15% contraction sequentially. 
That might sound like trouble, but it really isn’t. It actually represents year-over-year growth of 36% in Q4. 
So, investors know that Nvidia is growing and they’re interested in capitalizing on that growth. But at the same time, NVDA stock is reaching historical highs.
Strong Semiconductor Competitor
It is well-known that Nvidia is among the strongest semiconductor stocks in the world. But it should also be noted that Nvidia’s market cap gains exceed those of many peers in the sector.
According to MarketWatch, the company has gained $530 billion in market cap since the pandemic crash in March of 2020.
7 Stocks to Buy That Could Be the Next Trillion-Dollar Company 
Interestingly, its gains outpaced many other chip makers, including Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), Marketwatch reported.
Basically, Nvidia is growing by just about any measure. I think most investors now want to know if NVDA stock can continue to grow even though they remain overpriced.
IS NVDA Stock Overpriced?
At this writing, Nvidia stock trades at $306. That’s higher than average target stock price Wall Street assigned it at $236, but lower than the high of $328. 
But concerns that NVDA stock is overpriced continue to plague it. Nvidia carries a price-sales ratio above 30. That’s among the lowest 5% of peers in the semiconductor industry. And it raises concerns that the market is overheated and NVDA share prices should fall. 
I wouldn’t bet on it. Yes, valuations are getting more stretched. But Nvidia simply continues to grow and grow its revenue base. Estimates are that the firm will record $25.77 billion in revenue this year. That figure could hit as high as $32 billion next year, but average indications are in the ballpark of $29 billion. Either way, Nvidia isn’t slowing. 
In a world where meme stocks rise in price despite a lack of fundamental improvement, Nvidia is a bastion of sanity. It produces arguably the most vital components to economies and continues to grow.
I don’t see it faltering any time soon or getting punished for its high prices. It has been “overpriced” for a long time, but the truth is it probably deserves every penny of shareholder capital it receives.

2021-11-08 00:00:00+00:00,"AMD lands Meta as customer, takes aim at Nvidia with new chips",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/amd-lands-meta-as-customer-takes-aim-at-nvidia-with-new-chips,,,"By Stephen Nellis
Nov 8 (Reuters) - Advanced Micro Devices Inc AMD.O on Monday said it has won Meta Platforms Inc FB.O as a data center chip customer, cementing some of its gains against Intel Corp INTC.O.
It also announced a range of new chips aimed at taking on larger rivals such as Nvidia Corp NVDA.O in supercomputing markets, as well as smaller competitors including Ampere Computing in the cloud computing market.
After years of trailing the much larger Intel in the market for x86 processor chips, AMD has steadily gained market share since 2017, when a comeback plan spearheaded by Chief Executive Lisa Su put the company on a course to its present position of having faster chips than Intel.
AMD now has nearly a quarter of the market for x86 chips, according to Mercury Research.
After securing Meta, the company formerly known as Facebook, as a customer, AMD now has deals in place with many of Intel's largest customers. It also has deals with Alphabet Inc's GOOGL.O Google Cloud, Amazon.com's AMZN.O Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Corp's MSFT.O Azure.
But AMD on Monday also announced plans to take on rivals beyond Intel. The company announced a chip called the MI200 which is an ""accelerator"" designed to speed up certain tasks like machine learning and artificial intelligence.
The new AMD chip is designed to take on Nvidia's A100 chip, which, along with other chips designed to speed up artificial intelligence, has helped make Nvidia the most valuable U.S.-listed semiconductor company.
AMD said that Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee will use the new chip in its ""Frontier"" supercomputing system.
AMD also took aim at smaller rivals. The company announced a new central processor called ""Bergamo"" that will ship in the first half of 2023. The ""Bergamo"" chip will have 128 computing cores, which are useful for cloud computing companies that rent out their chips on a core-by-core basis to outside customers.
Ampere Computing, a startup founded by former Intel executives, is pursuing a similar high-core-count strategy and this year signed up Oracle Corp's ORCL.N cloud service as a customer.

2021-11-06 00:00:00+00:00,Better Buy: Nvidia vs. Advanced Micro Devices,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/better-buy%3A-nvidia-vs.-advanced-micro-devices-2021-11-06,,,"Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) have been outstanding performers on the stock market so far this year, with shares of both tech giants beating the broader market by comfortable margins. Nvidia has turned out to be the better of the two stocks, as the chart below shows.
AMD stock, on the other hand, has underperformed the broader market for most of the year before stepping on the gas of late. However, AMD's weaker returns aren't necessarily a bad thing for investors who are looking to add a top growth stock to their portfolios right now. Let's see why that may be the case.
NVDA data by YCharts
AMD is growing at a faster pace than Nvidia
AMD recently released its third-quarter results for the three months ending on Sept. 25. It reported stellar growth once again, with revenue jumping 54% year-over-year to $4.3 billion during the quarter. Adjusted gross margin was up 440 basis points year-over-year to 48%, while non-GAAP net income shot up 78% to $893 million. The chipmaker's third-quarter earnings came in at $0.73 per share, up substantially from $0.41 per share in the prior-year period.
More importantly, AMD increased its full-year revenue forecast due to solid demand for its chips, which are used in computers, gaming consoles, and data centers. The company now expects 65% revenue growth in 2021, up from its prior guidance that called for a 60% increase.

Nvidia, on the other hand, has yet to release its fiscal 2022 third-quarter results for the three months ending in October. But its guidance suggests that its top-line growth won't be as good as AMD's. When Nvidia released its fiscal second-quarter results on Aug. 18, 2021, it called for $6.8 billion in Q3 revenue. The graphics specialist delivered $4.7 billion in revenue in the prior-year period, which means that it is on track to deliver a 45% top-line jump.
Of course, Nvidia could turn in a better-than-expected performance and deliver a stronger revenue jump, but its full-year growth is expected to pale in comparison to AMD's. Analysts expect Nvidia to finish fiscal 2022 with a 54% increase in revenue, which would be lower than AMD's projected growth of 65%. Nvidia may not be able to bridge that gap even if it outperforms analysts' estimates, as AMD itself has a habit of consistently beating Wall Street's estimates and raising its guidance.
In fact, AMD has raised its full-year revenue guidance each time it has reported results this fiscal year. The company had originally guided for 37% revenue growth when it released its fourth-quarter 2020 results in January this year but raised the guidance to 50% growth when it released its Q1 report. And then to 60% when it released its Q2 earnings in July. So it can be assumed that AMD is on track to outperform Nvidia as far as growth is concerned. This, however, is just one of the reasons why AMD could turn out to be a better buy than Nvidia.
AMD has diverse catalysts
Nvidia gets most of its revenue by selling its graphics cards for two applications -- video gaming and data centers. Gaming was its biggest source of revenue in the fiscal second quarter, accounting for 47% of its top line. The data center segment came in second with 36% of total revenue. Nvidia is the dominant player in these markets. Its share of the discrete graphics card market stood at 83% in the second quarter of 2021, according to Jon Peddie Research. AMD controlled the rest of the market, which means Nvidia leads in this segment.
Nvidia's dominance in these markets has supercharged the company's top and bottom lines and sent its stock soaring. AMD, however, gives investors the chance to take advantage of more opportunities. For instance, the company's computing and graphics segment provides CPUs (central processing units) for personal computers, notebooks, and workstations, aside from selling graphics cards that are used in data centers and video gaming. Nvidia doesn't sell CPUs, so AMD gives investors an additional market to take advantage of.
Additionally, it is worth noting that AMD seems to be making headway in the GPU market. AMD pointed out in its latest earnings conference call that revenue from data center GPUs more than doubled over the year-ago period. Management also said that sales of its consumer graphics cards increased ""significantly"" thanks to the launch of new graphics cards at aggressive prices.
Alternatively, AMD supplies data center CPUs and gaming console chips through the enterprise, embedded, and semi-custom (EESC) business. Nvidia currently doesn't have a presence in the data center CPU market, with its Grace CPU only expected in 2023. This paves the way for AMD to take more market share away from Intel by that time and boost its data center business, and also gives investors yet another reason to choose AMD stock over Nvidia.
Finally, AMD's semi-custom chips are used in the PlayStation 5 and the latest Xbox consoles, and the upcoming Steam Deck would add another gaming console to its portfolio. Nvidia, meanwhile, has only the Switch console from Nintendo to tap into the gaming console space. Sales of the PlayStation 5 and the Xbox Series X/S consoles are expected to take off in the coming years as per third-party estimates, as the consoles are still in the early stages of their lifecycle.
All of this indicates that AMD has broader-ranging catalysts than Nvidia, and investors need not pay through their noses to take advantage of them.
The valuation tilts the scales in favor of AMD
AMD is trading at 40 times trailing earnings, which makes it much cheaper than Nvidia, which trades at 95 times trailing earnings. Also, AMD's price-to-sales ratio of 10.7 is much lower than Nvidia's multiple of 30.7.
Choosing AMD stock over Nvidia right now looks like a no-brainer. AMD is expected to outpace Nvidia's growth, it has a broader range of catalysts, and is substantially cheaper -- making it an ideal bet for investors looking to buy one of these two growth stocks right now.

According to the survey, employers added 531,000 jobs last month, better than expected and a boost in jobs growth over prior months.
This is helping boost several Dow stocks modestly, with Visa (NYSE: V) shares up 3%, Walt Disney (NYSE: DIS) shares up 2.7%, and Boeing (NYSE: BA) shares up 2.4% as investors remain optimistic about a continued economic recovery.
On the downside of the ledger, shares of Merck & Co (NYSE: MRK) are down almost 9% after data from a competing COVID-19 pill showed it was significantly more effective at treating the disease than Merck's recently approved treatment.

Jobs growth giving investors reason for optimism
It's looking like the worker shortage situation might not be as dire as we thought. In addition to beating expectations for October, The Labor Department also updated jobs numbers for August and September, revising those months upwards to 483,00 and 312,000 new jobs. In both cases, the revised number is more than 100,000 jobs higher than initial estimates, adding almost 230,000 more jobs created those two months than the initial survey captured.
As a result, investors are sending shares of companies that benefit from a strong jobs market higher. This includes today's Dow leaders, Visa and Disney, which directly benefit from more people in the workforce. More people with jobs means more people with disposable income to spend. Joining Visa and Disney is American Express (NYSE: AXP), with shares up more than 2.3% today on the jobs report.
Also moving higher are Boeing and tech giants IBM (NYSE: IBM) and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), gaining on expectations of both increased consumer and corporate spending on technology and tech services, along with evidence that turnaround efforts at all three are starting to pay off.
Pfizer's COVID treatment data a bitter pill for Merck investors
In early October, investors were wildly excited by the data from Merck's Lagevrio study. The company's oral COVID-19 pill, which would be the first to market, showed that it cut hospitalization for COVID-19 in half, sending shares up more than 10% over the next month:
MRK data by YCharts
Today, fellow pharmaceutical giant Pfizer (NYSE: PFE) announced that its own pill, called Paxlovid, was far more effective, reducing the risk of hospitalization or death for adults at risk of severe disease by 89%. In other words, Pfizer's pill looks to be significantly more effective than Merck's at controlling severe disease, giving it a massive advantage as the likely treatment of choice for high-risk adults with COVID-19.
The results were so impressive, the pivotal trial for the drug was ended early, as it plans to apply for FDA authorization soon. Merck was expecting it could earn $7 billion annually from Lagevrio over the next several years; it's looking likely that Pfizer could be getting the lion's share of this business now.

Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) were up 13.5% as of 2:15 p.m. EDT on Thursday, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence.
AMD posted another strong earnings report at the end of October, which caused several analysts to raise their near-term price targets. The highest price target is $180, with most analysts bullish on the stock. However, one downgraded the stock from outperform to market perform on valuation concerns.
Image source: Getty Images.
So what
Northland Securities analyst Gus Richard believes AMD's growth is going to slow next year. He bases this view on the coming end to the chip shortage, increasing inventory, and higher operating expenses to support new chip products.
Other analysts agree, as the consensus estimate has AMD growing revenue by 18.5% in 2022, down from 65% in 2021. Earnings per share are expected to double to $2.64 this year, but should slow to 25% growth next year to reach $3.32, although this level of growth on the bottom line could still be enough to justify AMD's valuation.
Now what
With the stock hitting new highs this week and trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of 41 based on next year's earnings estimate, investors are betting that AMD can sustain high growth for several years, and that it can continue to hold on to its market share gains against Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) in the x86 chip market.
The need for data centers and higher-speed processors is certainly not going away. AMD has emerged as a leading supplier for this booming market under CEO Lisa Su, who has demonstrated exceptional business skills transforming AMD into a chip powerhouse in just seven years.
AMD is serving massive markets across data centers, consumer PCs, and game consoles. Management estimates its long-term addressable market across these areas at $79 billion.
The cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry is definitely a risk for investors to bear in mind, but unless Intel proves that its new chips can regain market share, AMD should remain a good long-term investment.

This has taken place while the Nasdaq, and more importantly the semiconductor industry itself, has been notching new all-time highs. It’s clear the Street continues to be disappointed at the performance of the company.
Signs of life have cropped up, however.
INTC stock is up four sessions in a row, begging the question of whether this is a dead-cat bounce or the beginning of a desperately-needed recovery. For now, all signs point to the former.
Before delving into the technical evidence, allow me to make a different case for why you shouldn’t bottom fish Intel here.
Consider Alternatives to INTC Stock
Intel’s loss hasn’t occurred in a vacuum. As its power and influence have waned in the industry, others have rushed in to steal market share.

Indeed, Intel’s descent has been matched and exceeded by the ascent of companies like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD). So if you’re bullish on the semiconductor space in general, you must consider the smartest way to play it. You can go dumpster diving and purchase beaten-down names like Intel, or you can embrace the current leaders in the space like AMD, NVDA, and others.
There’s no denying which path has proven more profitable for 2021. Year-to-date,  Nvidia and AMD are up 104% and 42%, respectively. What’s more, they’re both perched at record highs. For its part, Intel is only up 1% on the year. Worse yet, it’s 26% off its peak.
Even if you wanted to take the trash route with Intel, you have to make the case that now is the time to strike. Good luck with that argument. The fundamentals continue to underwhelm the Street.
With last month’s nasty gap, we’ve now seen three consecutive quarters of overnight declines. To report such a disappointing number, only to recover a few weeks later, seems extremely unlikely. I suspect it will take a surprising earnings report to turn the tide here.
And the technical posture certainly doesn’t support casting a line here. Let’s take a look at why.
Intel’s Chart

The three-year weekly chart reveals all sorts of problems for bulls.
First, the trend is a hot mess. Many tech companies have seen their share prices explode higher over the same time frame. For its part, the Nasdaq has more than doubled. Meanwhile, Intel shares remain at the same level as in 2018. Sure, you’ve gotten paid a modest 2.5% to 3% dividend along the way, but that hardly makes up for the discrepancy.
Currently, INTC stock is below the 200-week, 50-week, and 20-week moving averages. After earnings, the sharp drop shattered the $52 support zone and brought increased bearish momentum to the trend.
Thus, this week’s rally appears nothing more than an oversold bounce.
The daily chart echoes the bearish winds blowing on the larger time frame. Volume exploded during the earnings gap and continuation lower. With the past four-day climb, INTC stock has returned to the gap area. These zones often become support and resistance, so this is bears first chance to reject the rebound attempt. Even if they don’t, I still like fading this rally as long as we don’t get above the 20-day moving average (it’s at $52).

Look for a break of the previous day’s low ($49.71) to confirm the next downswing has begun. Then, buy this put spread.
The Trade: Buy the December $50/$47.50 bear put for around $1.
You’re risking $1 to make $1.50 if Intel falls below $47.50 by expiration.

Gaming stocks have been some of the top picks in the stock market during the peak of the global pandemic. It has demonstrated remarkable growth over the past few years as the industry continues to draw traction. The rise of global smartphone sales, 5G, and mobile infrastructure are among the biggest factors in the upward trend in the gaming industry. However, it is also undeniable that the global pandemic has contributed greatly to its success. Many people were forced indoors for a significant period and sources of entertainment were scarce. Some people turned to streaming services and some explored gaming as a new hobby. 
The gaming industry is enjoying a multi-decade expansion as technology continues to make new experiences possible. In October, we saw NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) introducing its next-generation cloud gaming platform, the GeForce RTX 3080. Gamers will have access to games with the highest resolutions, and fastest frame rates, paired with the lowest latency. So, with the questionable downtrend of gaming stocks currently, it could be an opportunity to buy on the dip. Separately, Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ: ATVI) reported its third-quarter results Tuesday. In detail, revenue for the quarter was $2.07 billion, beating the previous outlook of $1.97 billion. All things considered, it would not be a bad choice to be keeping an eye on some of the top gaming stocks in the stock market right now. 
Best Gaming Stocks To Watch This Month
Electronic Arts Inc (NASDAQ: EA)
Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc (NASDAQ: TTWO)
Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC)
Corsair Gaming Inc (NASDAQ: CRSR)
Electronic Arts
Let us start the list with one of the industry leaders, Electronic Arts. Essentially, it is a digital interactive entertainment company that specializes in gaming content and services. Most of which is accessible by consumers through a range of platforms, which include game consoles, personal computers (PCs), mobile phones, and tablets. 
Last month, the company had a record-breaking FIFA-22 launch. It took the opportunity to address the global football community through a blog post. At the time of posting, the company claimed that it already had 9.1 million players, 7.6 million Ultimate Team squads created, and 460 million matches played. This is a testament to the company’s success over the years in delivering the best gaming experience for its players. 
Furthermore, EA will be bringing some of its biggest hits to NVIDIA’s GeForceNOW cloud gaming service. It starts with Battlefield 1 Revolution, Mirror’s Edge Catalyst, Unravel Two, Dragon Age: Inquisition and Apex Legends. By having some of its top games on the GeForce NOW platform, more people will have exposure to what EA has to offer. Also, the company will be announcing its earnings after the market closes today. With that in mind, would EA stock be worth watching right now?

Take-Two Interactive Software
Following that, we have another top gaming company, Take-Two Interactive. In detail, it develops, publishes, and markets interactive entertainment for consumers around the world. Some of its labels would include Rockstar Games, 2K, Private Division, Social Point, and Playdots. Similar to most games out in the market, its games can be found on gaming consoles, PCs, smartphones, and tablets. 
With the holiday season approaching, there could be further upside for the company. In addition, its wildly popular Grand Theft Auto Vhas been a great hit thus far. The game has now sold more than 150 million copies worldwide. Gamers can now rejoice as the company is set to release another version of the game for the Xbox Series X and Series S consoles, and Sony’s PS5 by March next year. Could this be enough of a catalyst to provide a boost for the company? Only time will tell. 
Take-Two reported its quarterly results after the market closed yesterday. The company reported a GAAP net revenue increased 2% to $858.2 million, as compared to $841.1 million in last year’s fiscal second quarter. Furthermore, TTWO also notched in a GAAP net income was $10.3 million, or $0.09 per diluted share, compared to $99.3 million, or $0.86 per diluted share, for the same-period last year. “Our second quarter results were outstanding, highlighted by Net Bookings of $985 million, which greatly exceeded our expectations and increased 3% as compared to last year,” stated Strauss Zelnick, Chairman and CEO of Take-Two. All things considered, would TTWO stock have a spot on your watchlist?
Intel 
Another top gaming company to watch would be Intel. As one of the industry leaders, it creates world-changing technology that allows global progress and enriches lives. While it may not develop or market its own games, it has a strong hand to play in the industry by providing software and hardware. 
For instance, Intel unveiled the 12th Gen Intel Core™ processor with the launch of six new unlocked desktop processors at Intel Innovation last week. This would include the world’s best gaming processor, the 12th Gen Intel Core i9-12900K. Boasting a max turbo boost of up to 5.2 GHz and as many as 16 cores and 24 threads, this would prove to be a game-changer. Gamers and professional creators will be able to reach new heights of multi-threaded performance with the specifications it provides. 
It should not go unnoticed that Intel is also launching the new Intel 600 Series Chipset with advanced features for increased reliability and performance. All these will have broad availability starting November 4. The company expects more than 140 customers in more than 30 countries to add the new processors to their lineups by the end of the year. Given these considerations, do you think INTC stock will have more room to run?

Corsair Gaming
Last but not least, we will be looking at Corsair Gaming. Put simply, the company is a gear provider for gamers and content creators. It sells gaming and streaming peripherals, components, and systems. With the rise in popularity of content streaming among the younger generation, it would not be surprising that the company’s products would be in high demand. 
Corsair announced its third-quarter earnings Tuesday. The company had an underwhelming third quarter as it was only able to meet analysts’ expectations for its revenue but missed on earnings. It reported a revenue of $391.1 million and GAAP earnings per share of $0.02. Despite this, Corsair is still well-positioned to capitalize on the underlying secular growth trends around gaming and streaming. The company claims to have every intention to continue making investments to enhance its customers’ experience.
Just last week, it launched the DOMINATOR PLATINUM RGB DDR and VENGEANCE DDR5. These have the ability to launch at speeds of up to 5,200 MHz and capacities of up to 32GB per module. Hence, the DDR5 will push the performance limit further than ever before. Depending on preference, Corsair has the option to equip its customer’s new cutting-edge PC with unprecedented performance. With what seems like an exciting time ahead for the company, would CRSR stock be one to watch for the future?

2021-11-04 00:00:00+00:00,Is It Time to Buy the Dow Jones' 3 Worst Performing October Stocks?,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/is-it-time-to-buy-the-dow-jones-3-worst-performing-october-stocks-2021-11-04,,,"If you're a fan of blue-chip stocks, then you probably love bargain blue chips. Why pay full price when you can buy the same stock while it's on sale? However, a discounted stock isn't always a stock worth buying. That's true even when that bargain-priced name is one of the 30 hand-picked tickers that make up the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES: ^DJI).
To this end, here's a look at the Dow's three biggest losers from October. Is their blue-chip status alone enough of a bullish argument to buy? Let's investigate.
Image source: Getty Images.
Upended in October
First and foremost, last month's biggest Dow losers (from worst to least-worst) are IBM (NYSE: IBM), Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), and Boeing (NYSE: BA), with stock prices down 10%, 8%, and 6%, respectively, just in October. For comparison, the Dow Jones Industrial Average itself gained nearly 6% last month.
If you're looking for a common theme behind these sell-offs, forget about it. There isn't one. Each one of these setbacks had its own roots.
Take IBM's sell-off, for instance. All of last month's loss (and then some) was logged in one day a couple of weeks ago, in response to a disappointing third-quarter earnings report. Revenue fell just a bit short of most consensus estimates, but perhaps more concerning, adjusted revenue fell slightly on a year-over-year basis. Earnings tumbled just a bit as well, tainting what turned out to be a small earnings beat. IBM is on the verge of divesting its legacy businesses that are proving to be the fiscal drag, but investors aren't seeing the glass as half-full.
As for Intel's stumble, the bulk of its October loss also unfurled in just one day, and also the day following the release of its Q3 numbers. Per-share earnings of $1.71 were better than anticipated, while revenue of $18.1 billion just missed analysts' outlooks. It was the company's guidance, however, that did the bulk of October's damage. CEO Pat Gelsinger cautioned shareholders during the quarterly earnings conference call that ""gross margins will be below current levels for the next two to three years."" Investors responded by driving the stock price lower to the tune of nearly 12%, with most of that setback persisting through the end of the month.
Finally, Boeing shares were grounded (again) in October for all-too-familiar reasons. Boeing stock slowly lost altitude all month long in anticipation of what was confirmed with last week's third-quarter report. That is, more manufacturing flaws found in the 787 Dreamliner, and last quarter's 85 delivered planes fell short of expectations. Continued headwinds translated into a quarterly loss of $132 million and an adjusted per-share operating loss of $0.60, versus analyst expectations for a loss of $0.20 per share. Revenue fell short of projections as well, even if they were up 8% year over year.
What are the implications of these drops?
So now what? Are these pullbacks errant, setting up big bounces back? Or, did investors collectively make the right call? The answer depends on the Dow stock in question.
If you're talking about IBM, last month's sell-off is indeed a buying opportunity. The upcoming spinoff of its legacy business (which it calls Kyndryl) will leave the company heavily exposed to the hybrid cloud computing and artificial intelligence technology markets, both of which are proven growth arenas. There's no value-minded arbitrage that can be done between now and the spinoff's projected completion next week; shareholders will still be holding the new and old companies' shares at a net value that reflects the unified company's value right now. That unified company's current stock price, however, still doesn't fully reflect the aggregate potential of IBM as a whole or divided up into separate parts. Shares of IBM are presently priced at a modest 11 times next year's projected profits, and earnings growth should be easier to muster if the two differing entities can each focus on doing fewer things better.
As for Intel and Boeing, the smart move here may be passing on both until there's greater clarity about their futures.
That's not necessarily the same thing as a sell recommendation if you own either stock. Both companies are survivors even if they're no longer stalwarts, and each outfit is also a leader within its industry. But both Boeing and Intel face unique, bigger-picture problems that continue to trip their stocks up.
Until investors are able to see evidence that Intel is pushing past its supply chain and fab/foundry woes and Boeing's production isn't plagued by design flaws as well as the supply chain headache, don't be surprised to see these tickers continue to be upended. There are better investment choices out there for newcomers, like the aforementioned IBM.
