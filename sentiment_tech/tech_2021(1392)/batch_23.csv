2021-07-16 00:00:00+00:00,"Intel’s Potential GlobalFoundries Acquisition Could Be a High Stake, High Reward Game, Says Analyst",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intels-potential-globalfoundries-acquisition-could-be-a-high-stake-high-reward-game-says,,,"Yesterday, the Wall Street Journal reported that Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) could be exploring the acquisition of GlobalFoundries (GF). The report cited unknown sources saying that the deal could be valued at $30 billion.
The report also said that GlobalFoundries was created after Advanced Micro Devices or AMD (NASDAQ: AMD) decided to spin-off its chip-production operations and is one of the largest specialist chip-production companies.
The Wall Street Journal said that AMD continues to be a big customer for GlobalFoundries, and entered into a multi-year $1.6 billion chip-component supply deal with the company earlier this year. The report cited data from TrendForce and noted that GlobalFoundries accounts for 7% of foundry market revenues globally.
Following the news, Robert W. Baird analyst Tristan Gerra reiterated a Buy and a price target of $85 (52.3% upside potential) on the stock. Gerra said that the acquisition of GF would “offer a great fit” for Intel.
Back in April, Gerra speculated in another research report that Intel could acquire a specialty foundry for its new  Intel Foundry Services (IFS) business division. The analyst added that GlobalFoundries “would represent an ideal candidate to kick start Intel's foundry efforts.”
Intel Foundry Services
Intel’s new CEO, Pat Gelsinger, proposed investments of as much as $20 billion into two new chip manufacturing facilities in Arizona earlier this year. He dubbed this strategic move as one which would reinvent the company.
Intel said at its Q1earnings callthat it planned to expand its foundry operations to other locations and intended to establish “Intel Foundry Services as a major provider of committed foundry capacity in the U.S.” (See Intel stock charts on TipRanks)
However, Gerra believes that the success of INTC’s Foundry Services is reliant on an acquisition.
The analyst added that Intel has two choices, either acquire a leading position in foundry services or over the longer term, become fabless. Gerra commented, “The stakes are high, and a successful Foundry Services business would have very positive implications for INTC's valuation rerating over time, in our view. The acquisition of Global Foundries would best meet Intel's core competencies goals, in our view.”
The analyst believes that the acquisition of GF could diversify INTC’s end markets, especially Automotive.
GlobalFoundries Bid to Expand Capacity
GlobalFoundries said last month that it would invest $4 billion, along with the Singapore Economic Development Board (SEDB), and investments from some of its committed customers to construct a new fab in Singapore.
The company stated in its press release that demand for semiconductors is rising at a faster pace, and to meet this demand, “GF has planned capacity expansions at all its manufacturing sites in the U.S., Germany and, starting with the construction of phase one of its 300mm fab expansion, Singapore. When complete, GF will add capacity for 450,000 wafers per year, bringing GF’s Singapore campus up to approximately 1.5 million (300mm) wafers per year. ”
Over the last 10 years, GF has invested more than $15 billion at Fab 8, its most advanced semiconductor facility located in Malta, NY. This year, the company plans to double its investment to expand its global capacity and intends to invest $500 million in Malta, NY alone.
According to analyst Gerra, considering the capacity expansion, GF “would bring exactly what Intel needs: a leading position in 12nm+ manufacturing, and long-term customers contract such as the 7-year NXP/GF supply agreement.”
Furthermore, the analyst added that INTC could offer customers of GF who “wish to move below 12nm a leading node roadmap, along with a well-needed manufacturing geographic diversification.”
Consensus among analysts on Wall Street is a Hold based on 9 Buys, 9 Holds, and 7 Sells. The average Intel price target of $62.81 implies approximately 12.5% upside potential to current levels.

2021-07-15 00:00:00+00:00,TSMC chairman says nobody wants war over Taiwan as chip supplies too valuable,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/tsmc-chairman-says-nobody-wants-war-over-taiwan-as-chip-supplies-too-valuable-2021-07-15,,,"TAIPEI, July 15 (Reuters) - Nobody wants to see a war over Taiwan because nobody wants to disrupt the crucial global supply chain of semiconductors, the chairman of major chipmaker TSMC 2330.TW, TSM.N said on Thursday, in unusually direct comments about geopolitics.
Tensions over the past year or so have risen around Taiwan as China seeks to assert its sovereignty claims, with repeated military drills near the island that have caused concern in Washington and other Western capitals.
Mark Liu, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd's chairman, told anearnings callthat the COVID-19 pandemic has already been disruptive enough for the global economy and no country wants to see instability around Taiwan.
""As to an invasion by China, let me tell you everybody wants to have a peaceful Taiwan Strait. Because it is to every country's benefit, but also because of the semiconductor supply chain in Taiwan - no one wants to disrupt it.""
TSMC, the world's largest contract chipmaker and a major Apple Inc AAPL.O supplier, is at the centre of global efforts to resolve chip shortages that have in some cases shuttered auto plants and affected consumer electronics.
The U.S. government has been pressing TSMC and other Taiwanese chipmakers to do more to ease the chip shortage, especially for automakers.
Asia's most valuable manufacturing company tends to try and stay out of politics, though it has large business interests in both China and the United States and has to ensure it does not run afoul of either government.
TSMC, which has a market capitalisation of $567 billion, more than double that of chipmaker Intel Corp INTC.O, announced in May last year it would build a $12 billion factory in Arizona, an apparent win for the then-Trump administration in its push to wrestle global tech supply chains back from China as part of a broader China-U.S. trade war.
Liu said that under the Biden administration, geopolitical developments were ""more predictable, more rules-based"".
In a rare departure from its core competency of chipmaking, TSMC signed a deal this week to import COVID-19 vaccines from BioNTech SE 22UAy.DE, in a venture jointly with another Taiwanese tech giant and Apple supplier, Foxconn 2317.TW.
Taiwan's government allowed the two to negotiate on its behalf following public pressure about the slow pace of vaccinations, and after Taipei blamed Beijing for blocking an earlier deal with the German firm. China denies that.
Liu said he was pleased the deal came together.
""This could be political in the beginning, but in the end we completed the contract and we did get support from all sides, so I don't think at the end it was as political anymore, otherwise this donation wouldn't be successful.""
Once they arrive, the vaccines will be donated to the government for distribution.

In the coming years, quantum computing stocks are likely to become very lucrative. If you’re unfamiliar with the technology, these computers use quantum mechanics to create multidimensional spaces and solve complex problems. As a result, quantum computers are significantly faster than traditional computers.
Quantum computing is a relatively nascent technology, but it holds a lot of promise in the long term. Corporations, institutions and other entities are in a race to develop these abilities and usher in a new era of computing. Though it may take years to scale, the world’s top contenders in the game are already building quantum computing hardware and software infrastructure today.
According to one study, theglobal marketfor quantum computing is expected to grow an impressive 33.1% from 2020 to 2030. The industry should generate nearly $1.9 billion in revenue during that period. Moreover, North America and Europe will likely hold a 78% share of the market by 2030.

7 High-Quality Stocks to Buy That Are Trading Below Fair Value
The industry looks competitive in the long-term, but is currently dominated by well-known tech superstars. With that being said, let’s look at three of the most promising quantum computing stocks on the market today:

Semiconductor giant Intel has been at the forefront of several cutting-edge technology developments. It has recently made its move into the quantum computing industry by producing quantum processors in Oregon. The company hopes to reach production-level quantum computing in the next 10 years.
Intel is currently on its third generation of quantum processors and is also investigating a technology called “spin qubits.” According to Intel, “spin qubits function on the basis of the spin of a single electron in silicon, controlled by microwave pulses.” The company believes it can scale spin qubits more effectively than superconducting qubits.
Spin qubits can bring several key benefits to quantum computing. They can greatly increase stability and durability during computations, and their smaller physical size can make quantum computing scalable. Additionally, they have less stringent operating temperature requirements than superconducting qubits.
Intel stock has the chops to become a massive player in the quantum computing space and join an elite group of tech giants. Currently, INTC stock is up 13.5% year-to-date and trades for $56.70 per share.

2021-07-14 00:00:00+00:00,"3 Reasons to Buy TSMC, And 1 Reason To Sell",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-reasons-to-buy-tsmc-and-1-reason-to-sell-2021-07-14,,,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE: TSM), the world's largest pure-play contract chipmaker, is often considered a solid investment on the semiconductor market. It's generated a total return of more than 430% over the past five years, while the S&P 500 only delivered a total return of about 120%.
TSMC's revenue rose 25% (31% in U.S. dollar terms) in 2020, while its earnings per share increased 50%. Analysts expect its revenue and earnings to rise 23% and 17%, respectively, this year as it profits from the world's insatiable appetite for new chips. Its stock has nearly doubled over the past 12 months, but it still looks reasonably valued at 27 times forward earnings.
Image source: Getty Images.
Those numbers suggest TSMC is still a great investment, but let's dig deeper into three compelling reasons to buy the stock -- as well as one bright red flag that investors can't afford to ignore.
1. The world's most advanced chipmaker
In the past, many chipmakers manufactured their own chips with in-house foundries. But as chips became smaller and more difficult to manufacture, many chipmakers either closed or spun off their capital-intensive foundries and outsourced their production to third-party foundries like TSMC.
Today, only three foundries can mass produce chips that are 10nm or smaller: TSMC, Samsung, and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC). TSMC remains ahead of both companies in the ""process race"" to create smaller and more power-efficient chips: It's currently mass producing 5nm and 7nm chips, and it plans to start mass producing 3nm chips in the second half of 2022.
TSMC's technological lead, which it's gained from more than three decades of expertise and investments, makes it the top choice for ""fabless"" chipmakers like Apple, AMD , Qualcomm, and NVIDIA. These strengths make TSMC the world's most important chipmaker and a linchpin of the global semiconductor market -- and it will continue growing as new devices require more powerful chips.
2. A well-diversified business
TSMC generated 41% of its revenue from 5nm and 7nm chips last year. The rest of its revenue came from older and larger nodes, which are still widely used for lower-end and mid-range chips.
TSMC also serves a wide range of markets. In 2020 it generated 48% of its revenue from smartphone chips, 33% from HPC (high-performance computing) chips, 8% from IoT (Internet of Things) chips, 4% from DCE (digital consumer electronics), 3% from automotive chips, and the rest from other industries.
All of those markets, except for the pandemic-stricken auto market, expanded during the year. This year, its smartphone business should continue expanding as new 5G phones hit the market, the expansion of data centers and edge computing services should bolster its sales of HPC and IoT chips, and the automotive sector should gradually recover as the pandemic passes.
That diversification has insulated TSMC from industry-specific downturns in the past, and should continue to shield investors from unpredictable challenges in the future.
3. Maintaining its lead in the process race
TSMC intends to maintain its technological lead by boosting its capex from $17.2 billion in 2020 to about $30 billion in 2021. It also intends to spend $100 billion over the next three years to boost its production capacity.
Samsung's chipmaking capex should remain roughly flat year-over-year at $28.1 billion this year, according to IC Insights, while Intel recently allocated $20 billion toward the expansion of its first-party foundry in Arizona.
TSMC is spending a lot of money, but analysts expect its earnings to continue to rise even as it boosts its capex to historic levels. It should also continue its 27-year-streak of uninterrupted dividend payments.
One reason to sell TSMC: The geopolitical risk
The single greatest risk to TSMC is its location. It's based in Taiwan, which has become a flashpoint for military and economic tensions between the U.S. and China. The Trump Administration forced TSMC to stop manufacturing chips for Huawei last year, and the Biden Administration has been trying to convince TSMC to manufacture its most advanced chips in the U.S.
The Biden Administration has also proposed to subsidize domestic chipmakers like Intel with the $50 billion CHIPS act. That support might make it easier for Intel to catch up to TSMC and Samsung in the process race, and make its domestic foundries viable alternatives to those of the two Asian giants.
These tensions could also force Chinese chipmakers to rely more heavily on SMIC, China's largest contract chipmaker, even though it remains several chip generations behind TSMC.
If push comes to shove, Chinese regulators could retaliate against TSMC's plants in China, which manufacture much older chips than its plants in Taiwan. Chinese chipmakers have also been trying to poach top TSMC engineers to advance the country's domestic chipmaking efforts.
China probably won't invade Taiwan with a military force anytime soon, but all these smaller strategic moves on both sides of the Pacific could impact TSMC's long-term growth.
The key takeaways
I personally believe TSMC's strengths still outweigh the geopolitical risks. However, investors should be well aware of these challenges before lauding TSMC as the perfect semiconductor stock.

Investing in the stock market can be tricky at times. With the resurgence of the tech sector, semiconductor stocks are also back in focus. After all, some consider semiconductors as one of the most important tech industries in the world today. There is no denying that it is very intriguing to invest in semiconductor stocks over the past year. The semiconductor chip shortage has been a global theme over the past year and it has affected many industries that rely on them. That said, it also means that demand for semiconductors is at an all-time high.
Last week, the Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) announced that global semiconductor sales were $43.6 billion in May 2021 itself. To put it in perspective, this is an increase of 26.2% year-over-year. The industry shipped more units on a three-month moving basis in May than any other month in the market’s history. Naturally, you would see investors showing faith in some of the top names in the industry. For example, we have NVIDIA Corporation’s (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock doubling in price within the past year. Meanwhile, we also have the rise of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ: AMD) challenging the likes of Intel in the microprocessor industry. Given all these, do you already have a list of some of the best semiconductor stocks in the stock market today?
Top Semiconductor Stocks To Buy [Or Sell] This Week
Texas Instruments Inc (NASDAQ: TXN)
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd (NYSE: TSM)
International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE: IBM)
Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC)
Texas Instruments Inc
To start off the list, we have the semiconductor company, Texas Instruments. In detail, the company makes and sells semiconductors to electronics designers and manufacturers globally. As of now, the company operates through two segments, namely, Analog and Embedded Processing. Impressively, TXN stock has risen almost 50% over the past year.
Yesterday, Texas Instruments introduced a new high-performance microcontroller (MCU) portfolio that advances real-time control, networking, and analytics applications at the edge. With its new Sitara AM2x MCUs, engineers could achieve 10 times the computing capability of traditional, flash-based MCUs. This means that designers will be able to push the limits in applications such as factory automation, robotics, automotive systems, and sustainable energy management. Hence, this is an important development as the demand for fast, accurate microcontrollers at the edge is on the rise. 
Also, earlier this month, the company announced that it has signed an agreement to acquire Micron Technology, Inc’s (NASDAQ: MU) 300-mm semiconductor factory in Lehi, Utah, for a reported price tag of $900 million. This would continue to strengthen its competitive advantage in manufacturing and technology. So, would you say that Texas Instrument is a top semiconductor company today? If so, would you consider buying TXN stock?

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd
Following that, we have one of the largest semiconductor companies in the world, Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC). Essentially, it manufactures and sells integrated circuits and semiconductors. It also offers customer service, account management, and engineering services. Moreover, TSMC also owns and operates the largest semiconductor design ecosystem globally, the Open Innovation Platform. 
The company will be announcing its second-quarter earnings report later on Thursday. So, investors could be expecting a strong financial quarter as the company had a better-than-expected sales performance in June. TSMC said that its sales in June increased by 22.8% year-over-year. This is likely contributed by shipments of silicon for Apple’s next generation of iPhones. So, this all bodes well with the upcoming earnings report. 
It is also noteworthy that TSMC claims that it has already begun construction at its Arizona chip factory site in June. This $12 billion project is the company’s first U.S. factory in two decades and will be one of the few production sites outside of Taiwan. The company’s stock may have been trading sideways this year. But TSM stock has still been up by over 80% over the past year. Hence, would it be wise to buy TSM stock ahead of its earnings report?

Some would say that IBM is a hub of innovation as it invests more than $6 billion a year in research and development, holding more patents than any other U.S. tech company. 
Last week was an eventful week for the company. First, we saw plans of collaboration with Atos to build a new digital infrastructure for the Dutch Ministry of Defense. It hopes to capitalize on the expertise of both companies to construct new data centers, safeguard its IT system, and build a proprietary broadband mobile network. Ultimately, to help ensure classified government information remains protected. 
Then, we also saw the company announcing plans to acquire BoxBoat Technologies, a premier hybrid cloud consulting firm. BoxBoat will extend IBM’s container strategy and implementation services portfolio to further advance IBM’s hybrid cloud strategy. IBM acknowledges that its clients require a cloud architecture that allows them to operate across a traditional IT environment, private cloud, and public cloud. So, this acquisition makes sense as BoxBoat is at the forefront of container services innovation. Given the exciting developments surrounding the company, would you consider investing in IBM stock?

Intel Corporation
Summing up this list, we have the tech giant, Intel Corporation. Simply put, the company engages in designing and manufacturing products and technologies. For those unaware, it is still the world’s largest semiconductor chip manufacturer by revenue. Intel is also the developer of the x86 series of microprocessors, ones found in most personal computers (PCs).
In June, the company and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) further deepened their partnership to deliver a completely new computing experience with the upcoming Windows 11. This would involve more than three-fourths of Windows PCs powered by Intel processors. Users will be able to access their favorite mobile apps to PCs with Intel Bridge Technology. Also, there will be Windows Snap and Thunderbolt™ 4 for the best multi-monitor experience. All these matter as it ensures that the PC continues to offer the best experience for the broadest ecosystem of applications.
Intel is not resting on its laurels. At the 2021 International Supercomputing Conference, the company showcased how the company is extending its lead in high-performance computing (HPC) with a range of technology disclosures, partnerships, and customer adoptions. Also, it announced its new High-Performance Networking with Ethernet (HPN) solution. On top of the ease of use offered by the Ethernet, HPN also allows application performance that is comparable to InfiniBand at a lower cost. All things considered, would INTC stock be a top semiconductor stock to buy?

2021-07-13 00:00:00+00:00,Why Lam Research Skyrocketed 37.8% in the First Half of 2021,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-lam-research-skyrocketed-37.8-in-the-first-half-of-2021-2021-07-13,,,"What happened
Shares of semiconductor manufacturing equipment supplier Lam Research (NASDAQ: LRCX) rose 37.8% in the first half of 2021, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. The semiconductor manufacturing equipment industry has consolidated over the past couple of decades as cyclicality took its toll, leaving only a few strong companies with the ability to make these advanced machines -- Lam being one of them.
Fortunately for those remaining companies, it appears as if we are in for a supercycle in semiconductors, as the growth trends in artificial intelligence, 5G communications, and more intelligent connected devices are all taking off at once. And all of these trends were only accelerated by the pandemic.
Image source: Getty Images.
So what
Even though Lam Research and peers had already put in strong performances in 2020, especially after the development of effective COVID-19 vaccines, the entire sector received an added boost in 2021. Accelerated digitization trends, which emerged last year after a cautious pullback due to the pandemic, left leading semiconductor foundries and also entire countries looking to write massive checks to build out semiconductor manufacturing capacity.
How big are the checks we're talking about? Well, current foundry leader Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing announced plans for a $100 billion, three-year spending binge in order to catch up to surging demand and cement its lead as the world's most advanced foundry. Rivals Samsung and SK Hynix announced participation in Korea's 10-year $450 billion plan to catch up to Taiwan Semiconductor in terms of logic chip manufacturing, even though Korea is already a leader in memory chips. And U.S.-based Intel, which got a new CEO in Pat Gelsinger early in 2021, unveiled its own plan to become a foundry for other companies' chips, announcing a $20 billion plan to build new foundries in Arizona over the next couple of years.
Meanwhile, the U.S. Senate just passed the Endless Frontier Act, which would appropriate $52 billion to reinvigorate semiconductor manufacturing domestically, after chip manufacturing was largely offshored to Asia in recent decades. The House still needs to pass it, and other budget considerations must be made, but it appears that the supply-chain issues the economy is experiencing as the U.S. attempts to emerge from the pandemic have awoken lawmakers on Capitol Hill to the risk of not having enough semiconductor manufacturing capacity within the nation's borders.
A fair slice of those hundreds of billions of dollars set to be spent will go to semiconductor manufacturing equipment makers like Lam. And it delivered booming financial results last quarter with 54% revenue growth and 90% earnings growth. No wonder its stock has continued to rise.

Now what
Though both the first half of 2021 and the past 12 months have been terrific for Lam Research, investors can still buy its stock for just 19 times forward earnings estimates. Investors may have been conditioned to expect a decline in earnings at some point, based on historical cycles.
And yet, despite some cyclicality, it appears Lam's results are much more resilient than they were a decade ago. That's due to the emergence of its services segment, which now produces about a third of its revenue, as well as its foundry customers' sustained and more consistent investments in capacity.
So despite the huge run it has had, I'd expect more good things from this dividend growth stock.

2021-07-12 00:00:00+00:00,Is It Too Late to Buy AMD Stock?,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/is-it-too-late-to-buy-amd-stock-2021-07-12,,,"AMD's (NASDAQ: AMD) stock has soared roughly 2,670% under Lisa Su, who succeeded Rory Read as the chipmaker's CEO in Oct. 2014. When Su took the helm, AMD was still struggling to keep pace with Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) in x86 CPUs and NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) in GPUs.
But today AMD is comfortably ahead of Intel in the process race to create smaller and more power-efficient chips. Between the third quarters of 2014 and 2021, AMD's share of the x86 CPU market jumped from 23.6% to 41.1%, according to PassMark Software, as Intel's share fell from 76.3% to 58.8%.
AMD faced a tougher battle against NVIDIA in the GPU market, where it remained boxed in by its larger rival. Between the first quarters of 2019 and 2021, AMD's share of the discrete GPU market slipped from 28% to 19%, according to JPR, while NVIDIA's share rose from 72% to 81%.
Image source: Getty Images.
Nonetheless, the growth of AMD's EESC (enterprise, embedded, and semi-custom) business and the rebirth of its CPU business easily cushioned that blow. AMD's GPU shipments also continued to rise, thanks to the market's robust demand for new gaming PCs, even though NVIDIA sold more chips.
But after those historic gains, investors might be wondering if it's too late to buy this high-flying stock. Let's reevaluate AMD's strengths, weaknesses, and valuations to decide.
AMD's core strengths
AMD's greatest strength is its visionary CEO. After joining AMD as a senior VP and general manager in 2012, Su expanded the EESC unit by developing custom chips for Sony's PS4 and Microsoft's Xbox One, which both launched in 2013.
The EESC unit also started producing EPYC data center CPUs in 2017, and provided a new generation of chips for Sony's PS5 and Microsoft's Xbox Series consoles last year. This segment will grow even larger after AMD closes its planned acquisition of the programmable chipmaker Xilinx.
The growth of the EESC unit reduced AMD's dependence on PCs while generating fresh cash for the development of new CPUs and GPUs. Its Zen CPU architecture, which arrived in 2017, addressed the performance issues of its previous Bulldozer generation CPUs. It also launched new Radeon RX GPUs to keep pace with NVIDIA in the gaming market.
Another one of AMD's core strengths is its ""fabless"" model. Unlike Intel, which manufactures most of its own chips internally, AMD outsources its production to third-party foundries like TSMC (NYSE: TSM).
That approach enabled AMD to develop smaller and more advanced chips than Intel, which struggled with production delays at its internal foundry. Intel's foundry also remains at least a generation behind TSMC. All those catalysts boosted AMD's revenue and gross margins over the past five years.

Data source: AMD. YOY = Year-over-year.
Analysts expect AMD's revenue and adjusted earnings to increase another 51% and 68%, respectively, this year. Those impressive growth rates easily support its forward P/E ratio of 34.
AMD's main weaknesses
AMD's growth rates are impressive and its stock seems cheap, but the bears will attribute a lot of its gains to Intel's blunders. Intel struggled to maintain its two-year upgrade cycle under former CEO Brian Krzanich, who abruptly resigned in 2018 over an inappropriate relationship with an employee.
His successor, CFO Bob Swan, focused too heavily on cutting costs and repurchasing shares over fixing Intel's R&D and manufacturing issues. However, Intel finally replaced Swan with Pat Gelsinger -- VMWare's former CEO and an engineering veteran like Lisa Su -- earlier this year.
Instead of becoming a fabless chipmaker like AMD, Gelsinger is doubling down on Intel's CPU development and foundry efforts to catch up to TSMC. That process could take years, but Intel's expansion is buoyed by subsidies in the U.S. and Europe -- and that support could spell trouble for AMD.
Intel could also cause headaches for AMD and NVIDIA with its new discrete DG-series GPUs, which are manufactured by TSMC and complement its desktop and notebook CPUs. It's still too early to tell if Intel can gain ground against AMD and NVIDIA, but it could resort to aggressive pricing and bundling tactics to grow its market share.
Lastly, NVIDIA -- led by its own visionary CEO Jensen Huang -- remains a formidable opponent. AMD has traditionally dominated the lower-end GPU market, but NVIDIA has been releasing a growing number of cheaper chips to lure budget-oriented gamers away from AMD. NVIDIA could also evolve into a rival in CPUs if its planned takeover of Arm Holdings is approved.
Is it too late to buy AMD?
AMD's future might seem murky, but I believe it will continue to outperform the market as long as Lisa Su remains in charge. Su planted the seeds for AMD's current growth cycle by diversifying its business and developing new chips, and this cyclical expansion isn't over yet. AMD probably won't replicate its massive gains from the past seven years anytime soon, but it still isn't too late to buy this high-growth stock.

Sure, a slumping stock price might indicate a faltering business that investors might want to avoid. But in many cases, it's simply Wall Street ignoring a strong company as pros chase riskier high-growth stocks instead.
With that in mind, lets look at a few dividend giants that haven't participated in the 40% stock-market rally since mid-2020. The declines that Clorox (NYSE: CLX), Kimberly Clark (NYSE: KMB), and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) have posted over that time might set investors up for impressive returns.
Image source: Getty Images.
Kimberly Clark pays a meaty dividend
Kimberly Clark, like its chief rival Procter & Gamble (P&G), had a strong pandemic year as organic sales growth accelerated to 6% from 4% in 2019. While each of those core metrics trailed P&G, the company generated lots of cash and won market share in key niches like diapers.
Investors have pushed Kimberly Clark's stock lower as they brace for a growth slowdown that should mean organic sales hold flat in 2021. Wall Street is also worried about potentially weak profits as material costs spike.
But Kimberly Clark is slashing expenses and has a stacked pipeline of innovative releases on tap across its consumer essentials. Value-focused investors will like its prospects of steady, profitable growth, despite the likelihood that both metrics continue trailing P&G. They'll be compensated for that gap by a 3.3% dividend yield that's almost a full percentage point higher than the industry-leader's payout.
Intel can't find the growth
Intel notched a fifth consecutive year of sales records in 2020, but there are dark clouds on the horizon. Sales were flat in Q1 due to slumping demand in its data center division, and the chip giant is forecasting a 6% drop for the full fiscal year. Manufacturing and supply-chain stumbles, meanwhile, are contributing to a sour 2021 outlook for this business.
On the bright side, Intel is cash rich, pays a meaty dividend for a tech stock, and is valued at a big discount compared to peers like AMD. Yet investors are right to demand signs of improving market-share performance in the PC and data center niches before buying this struggling stock.
Clorox will keep winning
There's no obvious reason for Clorox shares to be underperforming the market this year. The cleaning-giant's growth slowed in early 2021, compared to its pandemic-fueled spike. Organic sales were flat in fiscal Q3, which runs through March, after jumping 15% in the year-ago period.
Image source: Getty Images.
Clorox is still on track to deliver its best fiscal-year performance in 20 years. CEO Linda Rendle and her team believe the cleaning and home-maintenance niche will see persistently stronger growth following the pandemic, even though the next few quarters will face unusually hard comparisons. Consumers are likely not going to abandon the new priority they've placed on home maintenance.
Clorox had attractive growth and profitability trends even before the pandemic powered record growth on both metrics. Since then, the dividend yield has climbed to about 2.5%, thanks to a declining share price and Clorox's recent 5% annual payout raise.
Those factors should help ensure that this Dividend Aristocrat doesn't trail the S&P 500 for much longer.

But who says you have to choose? One fascinating sector today is the semiconductor manufacturing sector, companies that can be thought of as the ""picks and shovels"" to the ""gold rush"" that is the competition for leading-edge chips.
Although semiconductors, and therefore their manufacturers, are thought of as cyclical companies, over the long term, their clear growth trend is up and to the right. In fact, the semiconductor sector as measured by the iShares Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SOXX) is up almost 2.7 times that of the broader S&P 500 over the past 10 years:
SPY 10 Year Total Returns (Daily) data by YCharts
Despite the strong past performance, chip-reliant technologies such as artificial intelligence, 5G, and the Internet of Things aren't slowing down anytime soon. Yet semiconductor manufacturing is becoming more difficult and capital intensive, and the semi equipment sector has consolidated and matured.
That has led to fat profit margins for leading semi equipment companies and foundries -- enough to pay out nice dividends, while also seizing on growth opportunities at the same time. In that light, here are three top semicap equipment names with strong growth runways and dividends to boot.
Image source: Getty Images.
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing
Why not start with the biggest semiconductor manufacturing company in the world, in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM)? Taiwan Semi isn't an equipment manufacturer, but it is the world's leading pure-play foundry, where other companies turn to get their leading chips made. Thanks to its foundry-only business model, Taiwan Semi has recruited many of the top tech companies in the world to use TSM as their main foundry. Garnering expertise across many types of chips, from Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL) M1 chip to Qualcomm's cellular modems to NVIDIA GPUs, Taiwan Semi has cemented itself as not only the largest but also the most capable foundry in the world.
Taiwan first surpassed Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) in the race to a 7nm chip several years ago, and has only cemented and extended that lead. After its 5nm chips first made it into the first 5G iPhone last year, Apple is already sampling Taiwan Semi's 3nm process, which should be ready some time in 2022, according to the Nikkei Asia.
Just how dominant is TSMC? Even Intel is now sampling TSM's 3nm process, even though Intel is competing with TSM in process technology and has ambitions to be a foundry for third parties itself. Intel just announced yet another delay to its 10nm Sapphire Rapids server chip, which will now be ready in early 2022 rather than 2021. Intel's 10nm process is roughly equivalent to Taiwan Semi's 7nm, but since TSM is already manufacturing 5nm and will soon have 3nm in production, Intel is falling further behind. So even Intel will probably be using TSM's services as it looks to claw back lost market share against Advanced Micro Devices, a TSM client, while it aims to catch up with its own capabilities.
While others like Intel are spending big in an attempt to catch-up, TSM recently announced its own $100 billion three-year spending plan to cement its lead and meet soaring demand for leading-edge chips. For perspective, TSM spent $17.2 billion on capital expenditures last year, so it's essentially doubling that figure over the next three years. With that much spending, investors can be pretty confident growth will follow. Meanwhile, TSM's 1.5% dividend should follow on that long-term growth path along with revenue and profits.

Lam Research
Filling up Taiwan Semi's foundries is equipment from Lam Research (NASDAQ: LRCX), one of just a handful of front-end semiconductor equipment manufacturers with technological capabilities to meet the industry's most exacting demands. Lam's expertise is in etch and deposition machines, serving both the logic and memory sub-sectors.
Of particular note, Lam is a leader in machines for 3D stacking, a technology process that began to be widely used in the NAND flash memory industry over the past five years. But Lam's equipment is important for logic production as well.
Furthermore, with a large share of the market, Lam has compiled tons of data, which it can then infuse in its latest machines, giving them more automated and self-maintenance capabilities, and giving Lam the ability to sell data-driven services to customers that help them minimize defects and improve yields. Basically, the more machines it sells, the more data Lam collects on highly precise, increasingly difficult manufacturing processes, which Lam can then fashion into even better machines and new services.
While machine sales can be a bit lumpy from quarter to quarter, services tend to steadily grow along with its installed base. Last quarter, services made up about one-third of Lam's revenue, which can go a long way toward smoothing out historical cyclicality.
With specialized and differentiated machines along with high-margin services, Lam is raking in huge profits, with 30% operating margins and a whopping 70% return on equity based on trailing 12-month results. While Lam's dividend only sits at around 0.85% today, that dividend is covered five times over by earnings, so it's near-certain to grow over the coming years. Lam is also returning the rest of its earnings in the form of share repurchases, for a total shareholder yield around 3.2% at today's stock price.

Kulicke & Soffa Industries
While Lam Research makes front-end equipment, Kulicke & Soffa (NASDAQ: KLIC) is a leader in back-end equipment. Back-end equipment links chips together in advanced structures on a printed circuit board.
Moore's Law, which is the principle that semiconductors double the amount of transistors they can fit onto a die every one to two years, is slowing down, meaning advances in front-end semiconductor processes is also decelerating. That leaves back-end equipment to pick up the slack, connecting advanced chips, accelerators, and memory together in more energy-efficient packages. Advanced packaging and assembly is set to become much more important and capital-intensive in the age of 5G, the Internet of Things, and AI -- and that spells good things for Kulicke & Soffa.
Furthermore, Kulcike & Soffa has also developed machines for mini and microLED displays, a new type of display technology that should displace traditional OLED and LCD screens, at least to some extent. Apple's new iPad Pro uses miniLED display technology, and other screen-based products like TVs and even phones could adopt miniLED in the future. K&S management predicts a whopping 200% annual growth rate in miniLED revenues through 2025. While that is off a small base, in the coming years, miniLED revenues could become a material new segment at K&S.
While Kulicke & Soffa's stock has had a great year, up about 60%, it's actually down about 16% from all-time highs. It's also the cheapest of the three stocks here, at just 11.5 times 2021 estimated earnings. Like Lam, Kulicke & Soffa pays a growing dividend, which yields 1.1% today, but that was just raised by 16.7% in December and should continue into the future. Also like Lam, K&S devotes even more of its capital return to share repurchases, and has lowered its share count by about 23% since 2015.
Semicap equipment names are some of the best combinations of growth and value
In the tech world, software names, FAANG names, and chip designers tend to get more attention in the financial media, and tend to be bid up to pretty high multiples. Yet investors shouldn't overlook the less-glamorous ""picks and shovels"" equipment stocks that make these in-fashion tech sectors run. If you can stomach some cyclicality and volatility, semi-cap equipment names provide investors with some of the best combinations of dividends and long-term growth prospects today.

2021-07-11 00:00:00+00:00,Is It Too Late to Buy NVIDIA Stock?,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/is-it-too-late-to-buy-nvidia-stock-2021-07-11,,,"NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) shareholders have been benefiting mightily from the ongoing chip shortage, as well as from the popularity of the company's offerings for GPU-based applications. The chip stock has rallied by nearly 240% since January 2020.
The magnitude of that surge has plenty of investors questioning whether there's still a chance to buy in, or if they have essentially missed out on their opportunity to profit from this particular rally. Let's take a closer look at NVIDIA and attempt to provide an answer.
Image source: Getty Images
The state of the stock
NVIDIA's share price has increased by just over 100% in the last 12 months, and its scheduled four-for-one stock split is less than two weeks away.
NVDA data by YCharts
That stock price surge has taken NVIDIA's P/E ratio to almost 95. The stock has not seen such high valuations since the early 2000s. Moreover, when NVIDIA rallied in late 2016 and early 2018, P/E multiples above 50 amounted to sell signals -- the stock plummeted soon after hitting those levels.
Additionally, it has become expensive compared to its peers. Archrival AMD sells for under 40 times earnings, Qualcomm trades at 20 times earnings, and Intel sports a P/E ratio of less than 13.
Competitive advantages
On the positive side, NVIDIA possessives competitive edges in a number of tech niches. It has gained traction in the cryptocurrency space with a popular and powerful GPU specifically designed for mining digital tokens. It has built a presence in the realm of supercomputers -- its Cambridge-1 supercomputer will be used by businesses and academics to accelerate research in healthcare and genomics. Furthermore, assuming its proposed acquisition of Arm Holdings goes through, it could further widen its competitive moat, as many manufacturers use Arm's chips in devices such as digital TVs and smartphones.
And its longtime core products -- GPUs for video gaming -- are helping it foster innovations in the growing market for artificial intelligence systems. Its chips will power key applications in self-driving cars, data centers, and cloud computing, among others. Additionally, its AI-on-5G platform will also aid in deploying AI-based applications across 5G networks.
Financials and outlook
Given these innovations, investors can easily understand how NVIDIA's successes have boosted its financials. In its fiscal 2022 first quarter, which ended May 2, revenue rose 84% year over year to $5.66 billion. This included a 106% increase in gaming revenue and a 79% surge in data center revenue.
That lifted its GAAP net income by 109% to over $1.9 billion. Slower growth in operating expenses along with a boost in earnings from unrealized gains contributed to the bottom-line gains.
That performance for the most recently reported quarter also outpaced NVIDIA's results for its full fiscal 2021, when revenue rose 53% and GAAP net income increased 55%.
The company saw nearly $1.6 billion in free cash flow in the latest quarter, and close to $4.7 billion in fiscal 2021.
Nonetheless, its outlook may give investors pause. For its fiscal Q2, the company expects revenue to be within 2 percentage points of $6.3 billion, a massive increase from the $3.9 billion it reported in the same quarter last year. However, the company declined to offer an outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2022. This could reflect management's uncertainty about macro conditions as global economies attempt to emerge from the shadow of the pandemic.
Should I still consider NVIDIA?
Although the company's long-term growth story could easily continue, investors may want to avoid NVIDIA stock for now. Management's decision not to provide an outlook beyond Q2 indicates it could hit a rough patch ahead. Moreover, it doesn't appear wise to pay almost 95 times earnings for this chipmaker under current conditions, especially when the stock rarely traded at a P/E ratio above 50 before 2021. While it may not be too late to buy NVIDIA stock, investors should probably assume that they have missed out on the chance to benefit from this rally.

2021-07-10 00:00:00+00:00,Why Some Chip Companies Are Voicing Concern and Others Support for NVIDIA's Acquisition of ARM,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-some-chip-companies-are-voicing-concern-and-others-support-for-nvidias-acquisition-of,,,"Semiconductors aren't just a basic building block of technology anymore. With devices of all sorts (like appliances, vehicles, industrial equipment, and more) getting turned into computers and hooked up to a network, chips are a basic commodity governing the development of virtually the entire economy. The further advancement of chip tech and the type of capabilities they can unlock are of interest to all sorts of industries, not just in the domain of technology.
That's why NVIDIA's (NASDAQ: NVDA) pending acquisition of ARM Holdings from SoftBank Group is of such interest. Many companies have voiced their opinion on the proposed tie-up -- some in opposition to the deal, but others in favor of it. As a reminder, ARM is the patent holder and licensor of a wide range of chip architecture designs and related software code used in implementing chips into a computer system. ARM says some 70% of all people on the planet use a device with an ARM-based piece of circuitry in it. Suffice to say, a large and diverse number of organizations are customers, including NVIDIA itself.
The stakes are high, and NVIDIA acquiring ARM could shift the balance of power in the chip industry in a big way.
Image source: Getty Images.
The prosecution's argument
NVIDIA and ARM have stated they're confident the tie-up will be complete by the end of the first quarter of 2022. At the moment, though, regulators around the globe are looking into the affair. This sounds like it puts the marriage in jeopardy, but it's worth remembering that regulators questioning big deals like this is normal. Governments want to be sure a merger doesn't create unfair advantages in the marketplace. And the fact that ARM is a key licensor of chip tech to practically the entire global economy adds to the burden on antitrust regulators. So they want to make sure they get this one right, especially in light of other tech giant deals (for example, Facebook's purchase of Instagram and WhatsApp) being called into question after the fact.
But that hasn't stopped some chip rivals from trying to amplify the alarm bells, and Qualcomm is chief among them. Qualcomm, whose chip designs can be found in most smartphones around the globe, has said it's worried NVIDIA could limit access to ARM's chip licenses and keep ARM's best patents to itself. Qualcomm has built its mobile chip empire with liberal use of ARM designs, and has more recently added that it would be open to investing in ARM if regulators blocked NVIDIA's move. Alphabet's Google and Microsoft, also ARM customers, have voiced similar concerns about NVIDIA limiting access to ARM.
For the record, NVIDIA has promised that's not what it would do. It has even said it would be willing to sign legal agreements not to limit other chip designers' access to ARM licenses. In fact, NVIDIA's stated goal here is to inject its own technology (like its work on GPUs for use in AI) into ARM to give the entire industry a shot of innovation and provide customers with new options. This makes sense. Intel is far and away the industry-defining titan here, with some $78 billion in annual sales (NVIDIA has hauled in a comparatively small $19 billion in the last 12 months), but NVIDIA-plus-ARM could give engineers and electronic systems developers new choices.
Though the tides of change are already flowing, smaller companies are calling foul. Interestingly, one vocal opponent to NVIDIA has been U.K.-based chip start-up Graphcore, which is working on its own competing chip designs built specifically for AI computing. NVIDIA is riding incredible momentum in the AI department. Keeping ARM independent could help smaller firms like Graphcore stay competitive before NVIDIA can pull too far ahead in the race.
Long story short, while there are concerns around NVIDIA's bid for ARM and potential long-term ramifications -- namely, NVIDIA accelerating its position as a dominant chip industry leader -- the voices against the deal may have their own agenda beyond just concerns about purchasing ARM chip licenses.

What the defense has to say
Besides NVIDIA and ARM themselves, there are some peers voicing support for this merger. The biggest company is none other than chip design giant Broadcom. Granted, Broadcom is facing its own antitrust settlement right now with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), which accused Broadcom of monopolistic practices. Nevertheless, Broadcom is backing NVIDIA after receiving assurances ARM tech would continue to be available to all industry players. Broadcom, by the way, is a major ARM customer.
Two other ARM customers -- Marvell Technology Group and MediaTek -- are also piping up with support after having their concerns assuaged that ARM will remain available on a non-discriminatory basis. MediaTek's CEO has said the chip designer thinks NVIDIA and ARM could help bring ""more competitive and comprehensive products to the marketplace.""
Put another way, NVIDIA planning to turbocharge ARM's tech with fresh research and development could create new winners in the industry. Some of the incumbents voicing concerns might have the most to lose if the playing field is leveled and an NVIDIA-backed-and-funded ARM brings new semiconductor designs and licenses to the fore.
As already mentioned, the winds of change are already blowing regardless of whether NVIDIA's ARM acquisition is completed. This deal could be facing some opposition (or getting some encouragement) in an attempt to slow down or quicken the pace of change -- depending on what each player in the semiconductor industry has to lose or gain.

2021-07-10 00:00:00+00:00,"If You Invested $5,000 in AMD in 2015, This Is How Much You Would Have Today",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/if-you-invested-%245000-in-amd-in-2015-this-is-how-much-you-would-have-today-2021-07-10,,,"Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) became one of the more notable comeback stories of the last few years. The chip stock bounced back as CEO Lisa Su orchestrated a comeback and built a technical lead on longtime rival Intel (NASDAQ: INTC). Consequently, investors who dared to buy the stock at the lows hit in 2015 when many feared bankruptcy have earned a high-risk but massive reward.
AMD stock fell to a low of $1.61 per share in July 2015. At this level, $5,000 would have bought an investor around 3,105 shares. At the current price of roughly $91 per share, this investment would hold a value of about $282,640 -- a return of approximately 5,550%. This far exceeds the roughly 110% return for the S&P 500 over the same period. Also, the stock may have more room to grow as many analysts still consider AMD a hot growth stock.
AMD data by YCharts.
AMD in 2015
One can forgive investors for not wanting to buy AMD in the summer of 2015. At that time, AMD and other PC-related chip stocks such as Intel and NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) found themselves supporting what many saw as a dying product. Once companies such as Apple and Samsung introduced consumers to smartphones and, later, tablets, many consumers felt they no longer needed PCs. In 2015 alone, PC sales fell by more than 8%, marking what was at the time the fourth consecutive year of declining sales, according to Gartner.
This hit AMD particularly hard since it had consistently lagged Intel in market share. According to Passmark Software, Intel controlled 77% of the PC market in mid-2015, and that percentage had steadily climbed since 2012.
Furthermore, due to the three- to five-year cycles required for developing chips, an AMD comeback looked like a gamble at best. Since Su had only become CEO the year before, investors had no way of knowing if her plan would succeed.

How Su changed AMD
It would also take more than a successful career to convince investors that Su could turn AMD around. After graduating with a doctorate from MIT, she worked for both Texas Instruments and IBM, later rising to the chief technology officer position at Freescale Semiconductor. Su then started at AMD in 2012 as senior vice president and general manager of global business units before becoming CEO.
Su applied her engineering and business experience to bet the company's fortunes on high-performance CPUs and GPUs, letting other businesses fall by the wayside. Also, Intel had prospered through the tick-tock cycle, advancing manufacturing in ""tick"" years and offering new microarchitecture during the ""tock"" cycle. To buy time, AMD pursued both processes simultaneously, according to an interview Su gave to CNN.
Through these efforts, AMD released its first Ryzen and Epyc processors in 2017. This helped send the stock above $10 per share by January of that year. In time, AMD began challenging NVIDIA in the GPU space. It won several contracts, and today, AMD processors help power Tesla's vehicles as well as gaming consoles such as Microsoft's Xbox and the Sony PlayStation. Moreover, due to internal problems at Intel, AMD took a technical lead in the CPU space. Now, AMD sells 7nm processors at a time when Intel has delayed the release of 7nm processors until 2022. This should ensure AMD's technical lead for the foreseeable future.
Putting the AMD comeback into perspective
The AMD story shows how much investors can profit from taking a chance on a troubled stock.
To be clear though, articles like this do not convey the dangers, risks, and emotions that come with buying a stock below $2 per share when investors see no concrete prospects for recovery. You can lose everything on such holdings, and you should not invest money that you cannot afford to lose.
Still, as AMD has shown, these investments can sometimes succeed -- even wildly succeed. If you have some spare cash, a small position in such a company could deliver outsized returns to the risk-tolerant, patient investor.

The 10-year Treasury yield dropped below 1.25% today – marking its lowest point since February – before settling down 3 basis points to 1.29%, still well below where it started July (1.44%).

""The sharp drop in yields reflects the market’s concern that the Fed will begin tapering soon, and that the removal of liquidity from the system will create volatility and a rush out of risk assets (like equities) and toward safe havens (like government bonds),"" says Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for registered investment advisor Independent Advisor Alliance.
Also weighing on sentiment were unemployment-benefit filings for the week of July 3, which rose slightly to 373,000 from 371,000 the week prior and easily outstripped consensus estimates for 350,000 claims.
But while the major indexes opened on pace for their worst daily performance in months, they managed to regain some composure by the close. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by more than 1.5% at its nadir, but ended the day with a slimmer 0.8% decline to 34,421. The S&P 500 (-0.9% to 4,320) and Nasdaq Composite (-0.7% to 14,559) also finished off their lows.
""A market moment, not a trend setter,"" says George Ball, chairman of Houston-based investment firm Sanders Morris Harris. He described Thursday's yield decline as mostly technical in nature, chalking it up to repositioning by portfolio managers who expected 10-year rates to rise and held short positions in bonds.

2021-07-08 00:00:00+00:00,August 27th Options Now Available For Intel,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/august-27th-options-now-available-for-intel-2021-07-08,,,"Investors in Intel Corp (Symbol: INTC) saw new options begin trading today, for the August 27th expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the INTC options chain for the new August 27th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $53.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.47. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $53.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $51.53 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of INTC, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $55.48/share today.
Because the $53.00 strike represents an approximate 4% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 100%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 2.77% return on the cash commitment, or 20.25% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Intel Corp, and highlighting in green where the $53.00 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $56.00 strike price has a current bid of $2.09. If an investor was to purchase shares of INTC stock at the current price level of $55.48/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $56.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 4.70% if the stock gets called away at the August 27th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if INTC shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Intel Corp, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing INTC's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $56.00 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $56.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 3.77% boost of extra return to the investor, or 27.50% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.
Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $55.48) to be 38%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

2021-07-08 00:00:00+00:00,3 Blue-Chip Stocks to Trade Right Now,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-blue-chip-stocks-to-trade-right-now-2021-07-08,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
It’s been a dazzling 2021 for most blue-chip investors. But in a market made up of indices and individual companies, some blue-chip stocks are declaring their right to trade more spirited and others independently of their peers. Today, let’s diplomatically walk the aisle and show price charts of three blue-chips to trade for bulls and bears.
The Dow Jones Industrials. The venerable blue-chip market average is up 13% entering the second-half of the calendar year. It’s also just off all-time-highs and nearly 100% removed from a deathly Covid bottom set back in March 2020.
Then there’s the blue-chip, tech-heavy Nasdaq. On both fronts, it’s enjoying a marginal lead with gains of 14% and 121% respectively. Life for many investors has obviously been good, right? Correct.
Yet in a market which has seen a rather sweeping risk-off rotation this year, endured inflation fears and other pandemic-blamed shortages and what not, not all blue-chips have been keeping up with the proverbial Joneses.
7 Best Value Stocks to Buy If You Need Some Market Stability in Your Life
Some blue-chip stocks have led the charge. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) is up 40% year-to-date and three-fold the Dow’s performance. At the same time, constituent Merck (NYSE:MRK) is at the back of the pack suffering a minor loss of 4.5%.
Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN)
Biogen (NASDAQ:BIIB)
Intel (NASDAQ:INTC)
So, What’s an investor to do? I’d proffer sticking with the price charts. And then, as you’ll see below, diversify today’s bull market with a breakout to buy, a pullback to steal and a blue-chip losing its shirt that’s meant to be shorted.
Blue-Chip Stocks to Trade: Amazon (AMZN)

Source: Charts by TradingView
The first of our blue-chip stocks to trade are shares of Amazon. And today, AMZN stock is a buy.
You don’t need me to tell you the tech giant’s goods and services were a godsend during Covid. They were. Nor do I need to state the obvious that AMZN’s tendrils, on the other side of the pandemic, will invariably be even more important in our lives. It’s as good as written in stone.
But today and maybe less noticeable, AMZN stock is also offering to make a meaningful difference in investors’ portfolios.
Technically, shares have busted out of a year-long corrective double-bottom pattern this month. With shares roughly 5% above pattern resistance and stochastics flattening near oversold levels, this well-constructed breakout should find shares conservatively reaching $4,000 to upward of $4,400 by the end of the year.
To minimize the breakout pattern’s downside risk while leveraging its upside potential, a September $3,700/$4,000 bull call spread or November $3,800/$4,100 call vertical are two favored plays on this blue-chip stock.
Biogen (BIIB)

Source: Charts by TradingView
The next of our blue-chip stocks to trade is biotech giant Biogen. Shares surged higher in early June following word of U.S. regulators approving a first-ever Alzheimer’s drug. It was a “big day” for patients, but possibly more challenging for investors despite the session’s gain of nearly 40%.
The difficult testing of Biogen’s shareholders could be changing, though. And I’m upbeat BBIB stock is a buy.
Technically, the past month since the announcement has worked to form a pullback pattern backed by prior pattern resistance lines and 50% Fibonacci retracement level. It’s potentially bullish. And with BIIB’s monthly stochastics bullishly expanding in neutral territory, this pullback looks like a more certain blue-chip stock to buy.
7 Best Value Stocks to Buy If You Need Some Market Stability in Your Life
For positioning in BIIB stock, let’s have this blue-chip show us the money with a well-structured August $360/$380 bull call spread.
Blue-Chip Stocks to Trade: Intel (INTC)

Source: Charts by TradingView
The last of our blue-chip stocks to trade are shares of Intel. It’s the largest semiconductor by revenues, but it’s also been losing its shirt in recent years to chips from Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD).
I’m always open to the idea of a comeback. But today and on the price chart, this blue-chip remains a name to short.
Technically and as the monthly view of INTC reveals, the stock confirmed a volatile double-top pattern in May. Shares have since signaled a possible conclusion to the bearish cycle as June’s candle penetrated the high of May’s hammer.
But a failure to rally, as well as diverging and bearish stochastics has our attention.
I’m forecasting INTC’s bearish cycle is unlikely to finish until shares challenge pattern and Fibonacci support near $48 to $49 a share. And I think that’s going to happen in 2021’s second-half.
To better hedge that proposition, off and on this blue-chip stock’s price chart, a purchase of the October $52.50/$50 put spread looks about right.

That bodes especially well for the Nasdaq-100, a benchmark of the top 100 non-financial companies weighted by market capitalization. These stocks are responsible for an estimated 90% of the movement that the greater Nasdaq Composite experiences. 
Inside the Nasdaq 100 are such growth-oriented large caps as Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL), Intel (INTC), Facebook (FB), Microsoft (MSFT), and others. 
As of 3/31, it had a 48.21% holding in the Information Technology sector, a 19.19% holding in the Communication Services arena, and an 18.27% holding in Consumer Discretionary. 
The index has outperformed the S&P 500 Index for 11 of the past 13 years. In 2020, it ended the year with a combined market cap of $15 trillion. 
Investing in the Nasdaq 100 with Leverage
For investors seeking to capitalize on the Nasdaq-100’s rise, the ProShares Ultra QQQ (QLD) offers a leveraged take on the popular index.
The fund captures twice the daily return of the underlying Nasdaq-100 index before fees and taxes. The exposure resets daily, and as such, does not provide a simple 2x multiplier on the return of the underlying index. 
As such, QLD should be monitored at least daily by investors.
As a leveraged fund, QLD carries greater risks than non-leveraged benchmarked funds.
If the fund is held over a period of time longer than a single day, and the underlying Nasdaq-100 index remains trendless, oscillating without establishing a clear upward or downward trend, QLD can lose money.
However, in times of a clear upward trend, QLD, has the potential to outperform the index due to compounding.
QLD carries an expense ratio of 0.95%, with a contractual waiver that ends on 9/30/21.

2021-07-08 00:00:00+00:00,The Implied Analyst 12-Month Target For QTEC,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/the-implied-analyst-12-month-target-for-qtec-2021-07-08,,,"Looking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at ETF Channel, we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. For the First Trust NASDAQ-100-Technology Sector Index Fund ETF (Symbol: QTEC), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $174.40 per unit.
With QTEC trading at a recent price near $157.89 per unit, that means that analysts see 10.45% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of QTEC's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are Splunk Inc (Symbol: SPLK), Workday Inc (Symbol: WDAY), and Intel Corp (Symbol: INTC). Although SPLK has traded at a recent price of $141.32/share, the average analyst target is 26.09% higher at $178.19/share. Similarly, WDAY has 16.41% upside from the recent share price of $238.65 if the average analyst target price of $277.81/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting INTC to reach a target price of $63.71/share, which is 13.85% above the recent price of $55.96. Below is a twelve month price history chart comparing the stock performance of SPLK, WDAY, and INTC:
Combined, SPLK, WDAY, and INTC represent 7.44% of the First Trust NASDAQ-100-Technology Sector Index Fund ETF. Below is a summary table of the current analyst target prices discussed above:
NAME SYMBOL RECENT PRICE AVG. ANALYST 12-MO. TARGET % UPSIDE TO TARGET
First Trust NASDAQ-100-Technology Sector Index Fund ETF QTEC $157.89 $174.40 10.45%
Splunk Inc SPLK $141.32 $178.19 26.09%
Workday Inc WDAY $238.65 $277.81 16.41%
Intel Corp INTC $55.96 $63.71 13.85%
Are analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past. These are questions that require further investor research.
