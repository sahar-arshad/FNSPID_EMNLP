Starboard, which owns about 8% of Box, had earlier said the company had failed to capitalize on the work-from-home trend during the COVID-19 pandemic, falling behind its cloud computing peers.
Box did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The activist investor said last week it planned to nominate directors to Box's board. In response, Box said it does not believe more changes to the board were ""warranted or in the best interests of all stockholders,"" highlighting that it had added directors to its board under an agreement with Starboard last year.
""While last year we were pleased to reach agreement on the appointment of two new independent director candidates, it is now clear that those appointments have not created enough change,"" Starboard said in a letter addressed to Box's shareholders on Monday.
Starboard's nominees include Deborah Conrad, who previously served as chief marketing officer at Intel Corp INTC.O, and Peter Feld, managing member and head of research at Starboard.

2021-05-07 00:00:00+00:00,3 Top Semiconductor Stocks to Buy After Q1 2021 Earnings,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-top-semiconductor-stocks-to-buy-after-q1-2021-earnings-2021-05-07,,,"The fact that semiconductors are crucial to global manufacturing has gotten a lot more attention this year. Side effects from the U.S.-China trade war and the coronavirus pandemic contributed to a global shortage of chips, which has chipmakers and their customers scrambling lately to meet demand. It's a good time to be a semiconductor investor.
The growing need for chips in progressive vehicle safety and autonomy, 5G mobile networks, data centers, and cloud computing services is on everyone's mind and it's showing no signs of slowing anytime soon. It's also showing up in discussions about recent earnings reports.
To that end, NXP Semiconductors (NASDAQ: NXPI), Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ: SWKS), and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) look even more like solid long-term buys after recently releasing their first quarter 2021 earnings. Here's why these three semiconductor stocks are a buy.
Image source: Getty Images.
1. NXP Semiconductors: A rare play on chip design and fabrication
Most chip companies these days concern themselves with chip design (including Skyworks and AMD, which we'll discuss below). These ""fabless"" firms offload the actual manufacturing to outfits like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing. But NXP Semiconductors is a rarity, handling both design and fabrication in-house. It also derived 44% of its sales from the auto industry last year and another 21% from industrial ""Internet of Things"" equipment -- making this a solid bet on the rebounding auto and industrial manufacturing industries.
But this is no old and stuffy industrial firm. NXP's chip portfolio focuses on high-end computing trends like autonomous vehicles and advanced driver assistance systems, vehicle electrification, factory automation, and digital payments solutions in the smartphone sector. It's been a tough couple of years for NXP, but trends are pointing to a run higher as new demand for its wares ramps up and effects from the pandemic ease.
Specifically, revenue increased 27% year over year in Q1, and adjusted operating profit margin notched a big rally too at 30.9% of sales (compared to only 24.8% the year prior). Management is anticipating an acceleration in results in the second quarter, with sales expected to be at least 38% higher year over year and adjusted operating margin coming in at least at 30.7%.
Given the trend toward higher revenue and better profit margins after a rough 2020, NXP looks like a value. Shares trade for 25 times trailing 12-month free cash flow. If you're looking for a non-speculative bet on vehicle autonomy and batteries, NXP Semiconductor is a great place to start.
2. Skyworks Solutions: Connectivity without wires is the way of the future
If you believe mobile connectivity will continue to rise in the next decade, Skyworks Solutions is the stock for you. The company made a name for itself in the 2010s riding the coattails of Apple as smartphones went mainstream. But 5G networks are now here and have set off an upgrade cycle as consumers around the globe update their devices to connect to next-gen mobility services.
Skyworks still makes most of its money designing chips that help smartphones connect to mobile networks, and 5G has been a boon for the company so far. Revenue surged 53% higher year over year in the last quarter, and management said sales will increase about 49% from a year ago in the next three-month period. Adjusted operating margin was 37.6% compared to 32.5% last year, helping Skyworks deliver a 77% boom in adjusted earnings per share during the first three months of 2021.
But smartphones aren't the only growth trend this fabless chip designer is riding. It also plays a hand in WiFi 6 routers and smart home connectivity hardware. It's boosting its exposure to the automotive industry as well. It recently announced it's acquiring the auto and industrial equipment division of Silicon Labs (NASDAQ: SLAB) for $2.75 billion in cash, granting it expanded access to the connected and electric vehicle movement.
At 26 times trailing 12-month free cash flow, Skyworks looks like a long-term value. The 5G mania it's enjoying right now won't last forever, but the company has a new end-market to exploit in the equally exciting automotive tech movement. Now looks like a great time to make a purchase after the latest earnings update.
3. AMD: A seriously disruptive force in PCs and data centers
AMD used to be a unified design and fab outfit, but it offloaded its manufacturing arm GlobalFoundries over a decade ago. Since then, this has been a scrappy upstart, offering a compelling alternative to Intel's (NASDAQ: INTC) leadership in the PC and data center industries. But as the page has turned and a new era of cloud computing has dawned, AMD is now a leading chip technologist rather than an underdog.
Image source: AMD.
Case in point: While Intel is struggling with flagging sales even during a global chip shortage, AMD is booming. Revenue was an incredible 93% higher year over year in Q1, driven by growth across the company's portfolio of products. Adjusted net income was up 189%, driven by the surge in sales plus adjusted operating profit margin increasing to 22.1% versus 13.2% last year. Management sees continued strength in PCs, laptops, and data centers, and it forecast Q2 sales to be up another 86% and full-year 2021 sales to be up about 50% from 2020.
AMD is about to get even more profitable too, once it finalizes its pending acquisition of field-programmable chip specialist Xilinx (NASDAQ: XLNX). Xilinx generates a higher free cash flow margin from its smaller operation, and the two companies will combine developmental forces to further AMD's battle for market share against Intel -- especially on the data center and networking front as organizations around the globe start to ramp up investment in new hardware in support of new cloud-based operations. Once complete, the new AMD with Xilinx's assets will be a formidable player in the semiconductor world.
After the Q1 update, AMD stock trades for 56 times trailing 12-month free cash flow. It's a premium price tag, but a reasonable one given how fast the company is expanding and the looming Xilinx takeover that will meaningfully improve the company's profit profile. It's taken over a decade since offloading GlobalFoundries and refocusing its efforts, but it's safe to say AMD is now a top-notch name in the design of today's high-end computing components.

What’s new with IBM stock? IBM (NYSE:IBM) announced a milestone in semiconductor manufacturing yesterday. Now, the company is able to produce chips that are just 2 nanometers thick.

On top of that, IBM CEO Arvind Krishna recently joined the White House and members of Congress in endorsing the Endless Frontier Act. The bill would direct some $100 billion in spending to the National Science Foundation as the U.S. responds to competition from China and Russia.
Here’s what you should know about IBM stock and the larger scene.
The Details: IBM Stock and the ‘Tech Trifecta’
Demand for increased chip performance and energy efficiency continues to rise. What’s driving it? The “tech trifecta”: Cloud, AI (Artificial Intelligence), and IoT (Internet of Things). IBM’s new 2nm chip technology helps address this growing demand, though it is still several years away from full-scale manufacturing. Ultra-low nanometer chips consume less power, take up less space and reduce cost.

7 Stocks to Buy Right Now With All Eyes on Crypto
Better performance and energy efficiency. IBM’s 2-nanometer chip improves performance by 45% over today’s 7-nanometer designs and uses 75% less energy.
Push for more U.S. chip manufacturing amidst a global chip shortage. The mandate: boost American chip manufacturing to protect national security and economic competitiveness. A global chip shortage highlights the importance of the U.S. having its own domestic capacity. This way it can rely less on foundries in China and Taiwan.
Mainstream chip-makers Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM) have announced plans to build ultra-low nanometer chip plants in the coming years.
Intel also recently recommitted to continuing in-house chipmaking and vowed to invest $20 billion to build two new chipmaking plants in Arizona.
IBM’s Krishna called for fully funding the National Semiconductor Technology Center authorized by Congress last year. Krishna suggested placing it in Albany, New York, where IBM has a research center.
Covid-19 teaches us it’s time to focus on American science. IBM endorsed the Endless Frontier Act, recently re-introduced by hometown denizen and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and Todd Young (R-IN). The goal?
Reverse the serious disinvestment in science and research that has undermined U.S. healthcare and national security.
Invest in innovative research by mobilizing the country’s scientific talent in universities, research labs and the private sector.
This is because federal funding for basic research has steadily declined since the 1960s. It now comprises less than 50% of all funding. This decline is in stark contrast to countries like China and Russia, which are steadily increasing government funding.
IBM Stock News: How to Get an Edge
Buy semi equipment manufacturers on the dip. Coming out of a two-year downturn, the industry under-invested in back-end equipment. Now the semiconductor cycle is about to heat up. Companies that specialize in back-end semiconductor and electronics assembly equipment are going to be the first to ride a massive demand wave. New equipment is needed to manufacture ultra-low nanometer chips. This includes extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography and new deposition, etch, inspection and metrology technologies.
This is a perfect time to buy Kulicke & Soffa (NASDAQ:KLIC), which is down over 10% this week as investors “sell the news.” Looking closer, KLIC handily beat earnings, guided higher and signaled strong demand.
Other names poised to benefit are Advanced Energy Industries (NASDAQ:AEIS), ASML (NASDAQ:ASML), Ichor (NASDAQ:ICHR), Nova Measuring Instruments (NASDAQ:NVMI) and Onto Innovation (NYSE:ONTO).
Get an early start and invest in AI. New processors from IBM and others will be an important ingredient in AI accelerators, specialized hardware designed to speed up AI applications. These include speech and natural language processing and speech-to-text. Look for broader deployment of AI in unconventional areas like financial services, where it can be used for fraud detection. The best stocks to buy are those with proprietary tech in machine learning and neural networks.
My favorite names in this space include Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Twilio (NYSE:TWLO), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Docusign (NASDAQ:DOCU) and Dropbox (NASDAQ:DBX).
Wait before jumping back into auto stocks. While having bounced from pandemic lows, the chip shortage has caused a recent pullback in auto stocks, with Ford (NYSE:F), General Motors (NYSE:GM) and others having all cited problems. However, not everyone felt the impact equally this quarter.
Volkswagen (OTCMKTS:VWAPY) stock dropped despite solid earnings and strong electric vehicle (EV) sales, warning of the impact of the chip shortage.
Meanwhile, Volvo (OTCMKTS:VLVLY) breezed through earnings, reporting strong results despite a sizeable production decline in the first quarter. The shortage appears to have had limited impact for now, but it will likely cause more disruption in Q2 and potentially Q3. That means it may still be too soon to jump into these stocks.
The Bottom Line
IBM stock represents an innovative push toward efficient, ultra-low nanometer chips. However, this recent development also signals a bigger push into the technology trifecta of AI, IoT and Cloud.
Growth investors: don’t miss out on these multi-year investment cycles. Microsoft remains my favorite large-cap AI play, but there are plenty of small- and mid-cap ideas across all three areas. This is also a great time to buy semi equipment manufacturers on the recent selloff.

This is the craziest market I’ve ever seen. We now have conditions like we’ve never traded through before. Most notably is how big a role the U.S. Federal Reserve is playing in equity markets. They have developed a third unofficial mandate to also prop equity markets. As a result, the indices won’t quit rallying, even when it feels like a bearish day. One sector rests and another one makes a new high. Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock is one of the stars up 100% in a year.

That’s twice as much as its main rival Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD). Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is the third rival languishing red for the same period.
Critics complain about Nvidia’s traditional fundamental metrics being too high. They probably feel a bit vindicated since it has sharply corrected since mid-April. In total, it fell 14% from high to this week’s low. Nevertheless, it is still holding well enough, so there is no need to sound panic alarms yet.
I get it. These persistent altitudes make it difficult to invest with confidence. On long-term charts, it still looks too high to inspire bullish appetites. Therefore, any upside bets right now should come with moderate conviction at best.
Having said that, betting against it is absolute lunacy. NVDA stock spent eight months consolidating below $560 per share. As long as price is above that, the whole zone is excellent support.
7 Stocks to Buy Right Now With All Eyes on Crypto
Moreover, the company’s fundamentals are an even better defense for the stock price. This is not a not a cheap company by any means. But that’s not an attribute I look for in one that grows this fast. The value of this stock lies in the company’s incredible performance. They are reinventing the way the world computes, which can’t come cheap.
A Lot Going for NVDA Stock
Source: Charts by TradingView
Nvidia has a P/E of 85 and a price-to-sales of 22. That’s almost three times more expensive than AMD and widening. They are both champions among the chip companies. “Cheap” is not always smart because you get what you pay for. Those who chose Intel stock at a bargain literally got nothing for it in a year. Conversely, NVDA stock delivered a double win during the same time.
Strategically, the experts agree that they now have a material advantage, so it has a position of power. They are driving the trends of computer brain-power and everyone else is following. Gone are the days of it being a graphics card company.
Management will report earnings in a few weeks, so we will learn more about their progress. I am very confident that they will deliver excellent numbers. I am also equally as confident that we won’t know which way the stock will go that morning. The price driver on the headline comes from human emotions not facts. Case in point, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) reported its best quarter ever and the stock fell 10%.
Emotions Are Running High
Investors are more emotional these days than ever. Maybe this comes from the ongoing battle between Wall Street and Main Street on Reddit. There is a new breed of trader mentality that is relentless in the pursuit of their stocks. This is exaggerating the rotation between the Nasdaq and the small-cap stocks. The point is that NVDA stock falls through no fault of its own. It moves with the prevailing meme, not from fundamental reasons.
Value is not a problem and dips to $550 per share are buying opportunities. This was a level I marked as pivotal on the chart back in December. If the markets correct sharply, buying Nvidia stock at $480 will be a gift for a generation. If 2020 taught us anything it is to expect the impossible, so remain humble with the opinions. Back in 2018, Nvidia fell 50% from $280 per share. The more surprising part was that it couldn’t find buyers even at $120 per share.
At $280 the experts were absolutely sure that it was a buy. Yet, it lost half its value and there were no loud calls to step in at the bottom. Even if we know the value of something it doesn’t mean that its price will appreciate. At these heights, it is a good idea to limit our conviction levels.
To put it simply, leave room for error.
The biggest price driver for stocks is the Fed’s QE. This could come to a screeching halt if we continue to have strong jobs reports. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell last week told us he needed loose monetary policy to create jobs. Well, if we get the jobs, then the reason goes away – and the taper comes. We all remember what happens when the market throws a taper tantrum.

2021-05-07 00:00:00+00:00,5 Up-and-Coming Stocks in Red-Hot Sectors for 2021,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/5-up-and-coming-stocks-in-red-hot-sectors-for-2021-2021-05-07,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
So far, 2021 has been a year full of high hopes surrounding a global economic recovery. With vaccine rollouts at almost full speed in many countries, the expectations for a return to “normal” are very high. However, with the U.S. indices also at record highs, it has become challenging to find up-and-coming stocks this year. These are names that have great prospects but are not too overvalued.
For this list, I have found five stocks from different sectors that I believe you should monitor. All of these picks have great fundamentals, could deliver nice returns in 2021 and will add diversification to any portfolio.
That said, now is not the time to let your guard down. True, some stocks are attractive now and not too overpriced. But it’s important that you tread lightly. At an event hosted by The Atlantic, former U.S. Federal Reserve chair and current Secretary of the U.S. Treasury Janet Yellen noted the following: “It may be that interest rates will have to rise somewhat to make sure that our economy doesn’t overheat.”
This partially caused a selloff of tech stocks back on May 4. It may also mean that the Fed could raise rates sooner than expected. That should be a negative factor for stocks in terms of their valuation.

7 Stocks to Buy Right Now With All Eyes on Crypto
So, all of these factors in mind, here are five up-and-coming stocks to consider as we move further into 2021.
Alibaba (NYSE:BABA)
Intel (NASDAQ:INTC)
JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM)
Enterprise Products Partners (NYSE:EPD)
Lowe’s (NYSE:LOW)

Sector: Consumer cyclical
Industry: Internet retail
Why should you consider a stake in Alibaba stock? For starters, e-commerce is expected to boom in the post-pandemic era. Right now, BABA stock is down 2.4% year-to-date (YTD) but has a one-year return of 16.4%. This name has a trailing 12-month price-earnings (P/E) ratio of 23.67. Moreover, Zacks expects earnings per share (EPS) growth of 17.15% for the next three t0 five years. So, the stock is not too expensive now and has a lot of future growth.
On top of that, amid a tough 2020, sales managed to rise some 35% year-over-year (YOY) to 509.7 billion RMB ($71.9 billion) (Page 102). But revenue is just one positive among many points for BABA stock. For instance, net income growth is another area where BABA shines; the company maximizes shareholder value with a business model that converts sales into net profits. In 2020, net income surged to 140.3 billion RMB ($19.8 billion), or an increase of 75% YOY.
Alibaba is expected to be among the top leaders in global e-commerce in the years to come. That lands it a well-deserved spot on this list of up-and-coming stocks.
Intel (INTC)
Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com
Sector: Technology
Industry: Semiconductors
Today, Intel is up 15.7% YTD and still has a very attractive trailing P/E ratio of 12.35. INTC stock also has a annual dividend of $1.39 and a forward yield of 2.43%. Additionally, this company is set to benefit from the “CHIPS for America Act” and investments in domestic semiconductor manufacturing and research.
How so? Well, Intel is a tech giant with a strong, innovative focus on product development as well as a solid, dominant market share of the technology sector. But that’s not the only thing to like about INTC. On Apr. 22, the company even announced first-quarter earnings that were better than expected.
According to Investor’s Business Daily, “Intel earned an adjusted $1.39 a share on sales of $19.67 billion in the March quarter. Analysts had expected Intel earnings of $1.15 a share on sales of $17.86 billion. On a year-over-year basis, Intel earnings and sales both dipped 1%.”
That said, Intel’s Q2 earnings guidance disappointed and the stock still fell after the release. However, while there are declining sales YOY for the past three consecutive quarters, I am optimistic that Intel will soon recover and deliver even stronger results.
Intel increased revenue by 8.2% to $77.87 billion in 2020. Additionally, some more positive INTC news has already come to light; the company “has announced massive plans for investments in improving its products.” More specifically, Intel will be spending $3.5 billion on its semiconductor packaging and 3D packaging technologies.

7 Hot Stocks to Consider for a Greener Future
Right now, many tech stocks look too overvalued at their current price. This pick of the up-and-coming stocks, however, looks like a tech bargain. With expected EPS growth of 7.5% for the next three to five years, INTC is definitely attractive.
Up-and-Coming Stocks: JPMorgan Chase (JPM)
JPM)."" width=""300"" height=""169"">

Sector: Financial services
Industry: Banks (diversified)
Of course, an economy poised for a rebound also needs to rely on a strong banking system. That’s part of why I’ve put JPMorgan Chase on this list of up-and-coming stocks for the recovery. JPM is a U.S. mega-bank that can benefit from any sooner-than-expected increase in interest rates, per the comments of Janet Yellen.
Low interest rates have reduced the bank’s net interest income, which is the difference between the interest it earns from lending money and what the bank pays to its depositors. In 2020, net income fell a little over 20% to $29.1 billion. That’s compared to a net income of $36.43 billion in 2019.
Now, though, JPM stock is well-positioned for an economic rebound in 2021. Even this name’s Q1 earnings were stronger than expected. According to CNBC, “The bank posted first-quarter profit of $4.50 a share […] higher than the $3.10 per share expected by analysts surveyed by Refinitiv […] Revenue of $33.12 billion exceeded the $30.52 billion estimate, driven by the firm’s trading operations.”
Currently, JPM stock has rallied more than 77% in one year and is up 26% YTD. I still argue that it’s very attractive today, with a trailing P/E ratio of 13.58. It also has an annual dividend and yield of $3.60 and 2.24%, respectively.
Enterprise Products Partners (EPD)
Source: Shutterstock
Sector: Energy
Industry: Oil and gas midstream
EPD stock is a value stock and a pick in the energy sector. With crude oil prices touching highs and strong energy demand, either or both crude oil and natural gas should be supportive for this company’s financial results. Of course, Enterprise Products Partners was hurt a lot in 2020 — the year was tough for energy stocks all around. At one point last year, for a very short time, a barrel of crude oil dropped to -$37.63 in the futures market.
Ever since, though, the rebound in the commodities markets has been significant. Moreover, EPD stock has performed well, with a return of 18.4% YTD and 37.7% for the past one year.
On the whole, this company has four segments: NGL Pipelines & Services, Crude Oil Pipelines & Services, Natural Gas Pipelines & Services and Petrochemical & Refined Products Services. The Crude Oil Pipelines & Services segment operates crude oil pipelines. If crude oil prices remain high during 2021, they should be able to boost the overall profitability of the company.

8 Blue-Chip Stocks With Strong Earnings
With a trailing P/E ratio of 10.87 and a forward dividend and yield of $1.80 and 7.74%, respectively, this stock is a value play and an income deliverer. As such, even if the market gets bumpy for the rest of 2021, this pick of the up-and-coming stocks will provide some assurance in the form of dividends.
Up-and-Coming Stocks: Lowe’s (LOW)
Source: Helen89 / Shutterstock.com
Sector: Consumer cyclical
Industry: Home-improvement retail
Last up on my list of up-and-coming stocks, this home-improvement retailer is a pick for a strong U.S. housing market in 2021. If we start to see a boom in home-improvement spending, LOW stock could deliver very strong profits due to the broader macroeconomic outlook.
For starters, the pandemic seems to have had little impact on Lowe’s revenue this past year, which increased a little over 24% to $89.6 billion, up from $72.15 billion in 2019. That said, net income growth did slow in fiscal 2021, up 36% YOY to $5.83 billion. In fiscal 2020, net income had grown 85%, from $2.31 billion in 2019 to $4.27 billion.
Looking at its trailing P/E ratio of 23.3, though, LOW stock is still not too bad in terms of valuation. The stock has rallied 29.3% so far in 2021 and is up 89.3% for the past one year. Plus, even though the company “reiterated its prior forecast, which says spending on DIY projects and home improvement could ease as consumers resume normal activities post-pandemic,” the fourth-quarter earnings were a beat.
Finally, Lowe’s had a surge in free cash flow in 2021, up to $9.26 billion or an increase of over 229% YOY. That’s another very positive financial metric, both for valuation and for further business expansion– or even to buy back shares. Today, this stock sports a forward dividend of $2.40 and a yield of 1.17%.

2021-05-06 00:00:00+00:00,Interesting INTC Put And Call Options For June 25th,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/interesting-intc-put-and-call-options-for-june-25th-2021-05-06,,,"Investors in Intel Corp (Symbol: INTC) saw new options become available today, for the June 25th expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the INTC options chain for the new June 25th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $56.00 strike price has a current bid of 91 cents. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $56.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $55.09 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of INTC, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $56.98/share today.
Because the $56.00 strike represents an approximate 2% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 100%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 1.62% return on the cash commitment, or 11.86% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Intel Corp, and highlighting in green where the $56.00 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $58.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.55. If an investor was to purchase shares of INTC stock at the current price level of $56.98/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $58.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 4.51% if the stock gets called away at the June 25th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if INTC shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Intel Corp, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing INTC's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $58.00 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $58.00 strike represents an approximate 2% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 2.72% boost of extra return to the investor, or 19.86% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.
Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $56.98) to be 39%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

2021-05-05 00:00:00+00:00,13 Stocks Activist Investors Are Buying,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/13-stocks-activist-investors-are-buying-2021-05-05,,,"Most investors shy away from poorly led companies because they can really hinder share price appreciation. Activist investors are an exception. They acquire big equity stakes with the goal of forcing changes that may boost the stock price. 
When hunting companies in need of makeovers, activist investors look at issues like vague business plans, underutilized assets and excessive pay – all of which detract from shareholder value. They then push to implement changes that can include a business sale, slashing costs or a dividend hike. 
In some cases, CEOs ignore the activist investing advice at their own peril. Shareholder activists who are impatient with the company's progress will sometimes threaten ""proxy fights"" and seek to oust existing corporate officers and directors. 
Sometimes the actions of activist investors pay big rewards for other shareholders. For example, in late 2020, activist firm Third Point Partners persuaded Walt Disney (DIS) to cut its dividend and boost investment in streaming services. Since then, DIS shares have risen nearly 50%.  
Here are 12 stocks on the radar of activist investors. Some are newly under siege, others are embroiled in proxy fights and still others are listening to activists and making changes. Not every activist campaign is successful, however, so approach these with the same caution as any other turnaround play.

First Energy
Market value: $20.8 billion
Dividend yield: 4.1%
First Energy (FE, $38.32) is an electric utility that provides energy to approximately six million customers across Ohio, Pennsylvania and other eastern U.S. states. The company gained the attention of activist investors last year following a federal bribery probe that triggered the firing of several executive officers. 
Activist investor Carl Icahn has acquired a sizable stake in First Energy, up to 3% of its outstanding shares according to some reports. And in March, Icahn and First Energy reached a deal for him to have two seats on the utility's board. While he isn't pursuing control of the board due to regulatory constraints unique to the utility sector, Icahn wants to narrow the company's valuation gap relative to its peers. 
KeyBanc analyst Sophie Karp thinks Icahn may push for an outright sale of the company, but believes it more likely that some non-core businesses may be exited. She has a Sector Weight rating on FE stock. 
While FE shares have gained roughly 25% year-to-date, investors enticed by the company's high dividend should approach with caution. First Energy has a high debt load and a payout ratio that has been steadily rising. Both of these make for a risky dividend.

Intel
Market value: $231.2 billion
Dividend yield: 2.4%
A leader in computer microprocessors, Intel (INTC, $57.26) is drawing criticism from activist investors because of steady market share losses. Last December, activist hedge fund Third Point began pushing the company to explore strategic alternatives, potentially including separating its chip design and semiconductor fabrication operations and shedding some businesses. Third Point has reportedly acquired a roughly $1 billion stake in Intel. 
Famed activist investor and Third Point CEO Dan Loeb complains that Intel has been losing market share in microprocessors to Asian competitors and has been falling behind in the PC and data center markets because of weak efforts in emerging areas like artificial intelligence (AI).  
Intel hired Pat Gelsinger as its new CEO in February. Shortly after, he unveiled plans to lead a $20 billion manufacturing expansion intended to restore Intel's position as a major player in semiconductor manufacturing. The company also announced a research collaboration with International Business Machines (IBM) that expands its focus on next-generation technologies. 
In addition, Intel launched its latest third-generation processor in April targeting data centers, 5G networks and intelligent infrastructure. The processor also offers embedded AI. 
Both Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya and BMO analyst Ambrish Srivastava like the management change at Intel, although both warn a turnaround may take time. Raymond James analyst Chris Caso is more skeptical and downgraded INTC to Underperform in April.

Kohl's
Market value: $9.7 billion
Dividend yield: 1.6%
Activist investors began targeting apparel and soft goods retailer Kohl's (KSS, $61.82) in February, complaining that the company's financial performance was only slightly better than the worst retailers and pushing for massive changes to the board. The activist group – which includes Macellum Advisors, Ancora Holdings, Legion Partners Asset Management and 4010 Capital –, own approximately 9.3% of KSS shares. 
Kohl's sales fell 20% last year and the company provided weaker-than-expected 2021 guidance.  
The company is fighting back and says its activist investors lack retail experience. A proxy fight began that targeted five of the 12 members of Kohl's board and a settlement was reached in April giving the activist groups two seats. 
The activists want Kohl's to improve merchandising, update its marketing and rewards plan and increase inventory turns. They also want revisions to executive compensation and the company's real estate strategy.
KSS shares are up over 50% year-to-date versus 12% growth for the S&P 500, which the activist investors attribute to expectations around the pandemic recovery rather than the retailer's new strategy. KSS has ratings of Hold or Underperform from 14 of the 21 analysts following it that are being tracked by Yahoo Finance.

Exxon Mobil
Market value: $249.0 billion
Dividend yield: 5.9%
Energy giant Exxon Mobil (XOM, $58.82) has been in the crosshairs of activist investors recently because of its singular focus on fossil fuels, which they blame for the company's 2020 net loss and $19 billion in writedowns.  
More than 135 activist investors representing $2 trillion in assets joined forces in late 2020 and early 2021 to push Exxon Mobil to make changes to its board and increase its focus on clean energy. Engine No. 1, a San Francisco-based investment firm backed by the California State Teachers Retirement Fund, led the effort and wanted four board seats, a preserved dividend, smarter capital allocation and increased investment in renewable energy. 
Exxon rejected these proposals, arguing that the activist investor's strategy would put future cash flows and the dividend at risk. The company also rejected the idea of separating the chairman and CEO roles.
As a concession to activists, the company added Jeff Ubben, the founder of clean energy investment firm Inclusive Capital Partners, and former Comcast (CMCSA) CEO Michael Angelakis to its board in March.    
Rising oil prices have led to positive analyst ratings for XOM. In mid-April, Raymond James analyst James Jenkins boosted his rating to Market Perform. And earlier this week, Goldman Sachs analyst Neil Mehta reiterated a Buy rating on XOM, citing potential upside from cost reductions and the company's chemicals business.

Bausch Health
Market value: $11.2 billion
Dividend yield: N/A
Bausch Health (BHC, $31.42), formerly known as Valeant Pharmaceuticals, develops and manufactures branded and generic drugs, medical devices and over-the-counter products.
In addition to being one of the top stock picks of billionaires, Bausch has attracted the attention of several activist investors, who believe the company is undervalued and criticize its limited progress growing its business.   
Bausch had already announced plans to spin off its eyecare business, Bausch + Lomb, which contributes over 40% of sales, but activist investor Glenview Capital complains the company is moving too slowly. 
Legendary investor Carl Icahn joined the fray and succeeded in getting two new directors on the board in February after unveiling a 7.8% stake in BHC. The shares hit a nearly five-year high in March on expectations Icahn can get a better value for Bausch assets.  
Bausch has also made progress deleveraging its balance sheet. The company recently sold its equity stake in Egypt's Amoun Pharmaceutical for $740 million and plans to cut another $100 million from debt using cash from operations.

Market value: $46.5 billion
Dividend yield: 3.3%
Danone (DANOY, $14.40) is a global food and beverage manufacturer of yogurts, milk products, bottled water, coffee creamers, ice creams and powdered protein drinks. 
After incurring the wrath of activist investors by reporting losses during the pandemic, Danone in November announced several initiatives aimed at trimming costs by $1.2 billion and restoring profitability, including cutting 2,000 jobs. 
In a move to appease activist investors Artisan Partners and Bluebell Capital Partners, Danone agreed to sell its stake in a Chinese dairy firm Mengniu, and plans to use the $1 billion sale proceeds for share repurchases.  
The company also announced in mid-March that Chairman and CEO Emmanuel Faber was stepping down, and it has begun the search for a new CEO. 
DANOY shares have risen roughly 10% year-to-date, trailing the nearly 12% rise in the S&P 500. 
While the sale of its stake in the Chinese unit is seen as a good step to increase the stock's multiple, a turnaround with legs will likely depend on hiring an aggressive CEO that is strongly focused on shareholder value. Additionally, with DANOY trading over the counter, it's one of the more riskier stocks to trade on this activist investing list.

Elanco Animal Health
Market value: $15.0 billion
Dividend yield: N/A
Elanco Animal Health (ELAN, $31.80) develops and sells vaccines, wormers and flea protection products for pets and farm animals. The company was spun off from Eli Lilly (LLY) in 2018 and completed the purchase of Bayer AG's (BAYRY) animal health business in 2020. 
Activist investor Sachem Head Capital Management invested $1.2 billion in the company in 2020 and was given three board seats. The Wall Street Journal, citing people familiar with the matter, reported in early March that another activist investor, Starboard Value, had taken a stake in ELAN in February and aimed for three board seats. However, Reuters, also citing sources familiar with the matter, reported later in the month that Starboard withdrew its nominations in late March for undisclosed reasons.
However, neither Elanco nor Starboard confirmed either report.
Activists have criticized ELAN – a top contrarian stock pick earlier this year – for supply chain issues and weak margins. The company responded with a plan to improve margins by trimming $100 million from expenses. 
Despite some negative headlines about the company's Seresto flea collar product, Citi analyst Navann Ty is sticking with his Buy rating on the activist investing shares, anticipating a low probability of a product recall.  
Morgan Stanley analyst David Risinger has an Overweight rating on ELAN shares, citing three new product launches this year and accelerated post-pandemic growth.

Forward Air
Market value: $2.6 billion
Dividend yield: 1.0%
Forward Air (FWRD, $94.62) provides expedited freight delivery services and also owns intermodal transportation businesses. 
Activist investor Ancora Holdings recently criticized the company for its subpar performance relative to industry peers. Ancora blames weak results on acquisitions that have increased diversification, while it believes Forward Air should have instead been strengthening its foothold in the expedited freight business. 
Ancora holds a 6.3% stake in FWRD and initiated a proxy fight to obtain four board seats. Its demands included revisions to capital spending and the sale of non-core assets. 
In a nod to activist investor demands, Forward Air sold its pool supplies business in February for $20 million, bought Proficient Transportation for $15 million to expand its intermodal freight business and invested in new terminal infrastructure.  
Additionally, Forward Air capitulated to all demands in March by adopting five new board seats – two held by Ancora nominees and three endorsed by the activist investing group. The nominees will stand for election in May.  
Earlier this year, the company moved to strengthen its balance sheet by increasing its prices by 6%. And in its first-quarter earnings report released in late April, Forward Air reported an 18.5% year-over-year rise in operating revenue and net income per diluted share that was up 46.3% from the year prior.

Delek US
Market value: $1.9 billion
Dividend yield: N/A
Delek US (DK, $25.40) owns four oil refineries in the Southwestern U.S. representing throughput capacity of 302,000 barrels per day. The company also operates a 1,570-mile pipeline system, three biodiesel facilities, 10 terminals and 253 retail stores across the same region.  
CVR Energy (CVI) – a Texas-based energy company majority owned by activist investor Carl Icahn – acquired 15% of DK shares in 2020, and filed a lawsuit demanding full disclosure of CEO compensation, some of which was not disclosed in past proxies.  
According to CVR, Delek's CEO was paid an ""eye-popping"" $81 million over eight years, which came from a combined $53 million in compensation and a 5% stake in DK subsidiary Delek Logistics Partners (DKL).
Icahn's CVR Energy is seeking three board seats and pushing for changes that put free cash flow ahead of growth. He wants Delek to sell its retail stores and convert some refineries to biodiesel terminals. 
DK shares are up approximately 58% year-to-date mainly due to rising energy prices and an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) decision to extend the deadline for new biodiesel blending requirements. Analyst opinions of this refiner are mixed with eight firms tracked by Yahoo Finance rating the stock Buy and six rating DK a Hold.

Prudential
Market value: $55.5 billion
Dividend yield: 0.8%
U.K.-based Prudential (PUK, $43.19) provides life and health insurance to customers in Asia and annuities in the U.S. through its Jackson Financial subsidiary. The company is known for its market leadership in Japan, steady growth, solid balance sheet and well-supported dividend. 
Activist investor Third Point thinks growth for Prudential could be stronger and disclosed a $2 billion, or 5%, stake in PUK last year – recommending that the company separate its faster-growing Asian unit from its U.S. business.   
In January, Prudential's new more Asia-focused Group CEO Mike Wells announced plans to spin off the Jackson Financial operation, while retaining a 19.9% stake in the offshoot that will be sold over time. Analysts at J.P. Morgan Securities value the Jackson Financial business at $10 billion, minus the cost and debt share. 
While some investors seem disappointed with the news, Third Point thinks a greater focus on Asia will enhance this insurer's value. Last year, Prudential generated a 13% adjusted operating profit growth from its Asian business versus an overall company adjusted profit that rose only 4%.
PUK shares are rated Buy by the two covering analysts tracked by Yahoo Finance. In March, HSBC analyst Kailesh Mistry upgraded the stock to Buy.

ACI Worldwide
Market value: $4.5 billion
Dividend yield: N/A
ACI Worldwide (ACIW, $38.07) sells software that facilitates electronic payments to banks, merchants and other customers. North of 6,000 organizations, including more than 1,000 of the world's largest banks, use ACIW software to process $14 trillion in payments each day.   
Activist investor Starboard Value began buying shares of ACIW last year, and has now acquired a 9% stake. In reaction to weak guidance from ACIW that suggested no organic growth until 2023, Starboard has pushed the company to explore value-enhancing options that include a potential sale of the business. 
The company reached an agreement with Starboard in February to add two new independent directors, increasing the total board members to 12. 
Starboard's pressure has helped boost ACIW's share price 54% since last September, and the activist investing stock continues to be well-liked, rated Buy or Strong Buy by four of the six covering analysts tracked by Yahoo Finance.

Xerox Holdings
Market value: $4.6 billion
Dividend yield: 4.1%
Copy machine maker Xerox (XRX, $24.10) had hoped to boost sales by expanding into digital document management, but disappointed investors with a big miss on 2020 profits. Credit Suisse analyst Matthew Cabral complained of cost reductions and free cash flow improvements taking too long to materialize and downgraded XRX shares to Neutral.
Xerox rolled out a new plan in February to reorganize the company into three businesses – software, financing and innovation, each with its own management team, which it said would improve focus, flexibility and visibility for each business. 
Activist investor Carl Icahn is upping the ante on XRX stock. After criticizing HP Inc. (HPQ) for rejecting Xerox's takeover offer in late 2019 – which morphed into a hostile bid that XRX eventually walked away from in March 2020 – he recently increased his XRX position to nearly 28 million shares, a roughly 17% stake. 
Some see Xerox as a high-yield turnaround play, but investors should proceed with caution due to the company's excessive leverage, weak interest coverage and dividend payout that exceeds earnings. In fact, Kiplinger highlighted XRX as one of 15 dividend stocks to avoid last October.

Cubic
Market value: $2.4 billion
Dividend yield: 0.4%
Defense and transportation company Cubic (CUB, $74.80) makes technologies that help subway systems collect fares and the military manage weapon systems. 
Activist hedge fund Elliott Management unveiled a 15% CUB stake last September and indicated interest in buying the company outright. Cubic initially rejected the joint buyout offer from the activist investor and private-equity firm Veritas Capital, claiming its standalone growth prospects were excellent. CUB also put in place a poison pill to prevent Elliott Management from taking control.  
Cubic's action created a bidding war between Elliott Management and Singapore firm ST Engineering, and the former increased its offer to $75 per share, a 66% premium to Cubic's pre-bidding war price near $45 per share. 
Cubic's board has accepted this offer from Elliott Management and Veritas Capital, and CUB shareholders approved the takeover bid on April 27. The proposed merger is now subject to regulatory approval.

2021-05-05 00:00:00+00:00,Why Intel Fell 10.1% in April,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-intel-fell-10.1-in-april-2021-05-05,,,"What happened
Shares of Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) fell 10.1% in April, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence. The processor giant cooled off mightily after a large run-up earlier in the year, which came after the recent appointment of new CEO Pat Gelsinger.
Yet after the first earnings release under Gelsinger last month, the post-appointment optimism met the messier reality of Intel's current situation.
Image source: Getty Images.
So what
Intel released its first-quarter earnings report on April 22. While revenue actually exceeded analyst expectations, buried within the report were some concerning numbers. First, the company's all-important data center revenue was down 20%, and data center operating income was down a whopping 64% on lower average selling prices and higher ramp-up costs.
Moreover, Intel's updated 2021 guidance forecast revenue down 1%, gross margins compressing three percentage points, and earnings per share down 10%. Keep in mind, this is coming in a year in which PC demand and cloud capital expenditures should grow about 15%, according to analysts.
While Gelsinger claimed the decline in data centers was due to inventory digestion on the part of customers and the price declines were due to product mix, skeptics may not believe that since competitor Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) delivered blowout earnings in the same quarter, doubling its data center sales.
Now what
Intel had rallied through March of this year, so it wasn't a surprise to see some pullback. Furthermore, the stock is not expensive at just 12.5 times earnings. And Gelsinger has just started his tenure as CEO, so there isn't a reason to panic for Intel shareholders ... at least not yet.
Nevertheless, Intel is definitely in turnaround mode. Gelsinger announced on the call Intel would be buying back less stock while investing heavily in both ramping up its 7-nanometer node to catch rivals and also building out new fabs for its ""IDM 2.0"" strategy, whereby Intel will start manufacturing chips for third parties. While Gelsinger pointed to ""strong interest"" from outside chip designers in Intel's foundry capabilities, that effort will take years, be very expensive, and comes with uncertain ultimate profitability.
Until those new efforts bear fruit, Intel shareholders will have to contend with high uncertainty for quite a while. But on the bright side, the overall industry is booming, which could be enough to propel Intel through this transition period, providing the business executes better under Gelsinger.

2021-05-05 00:00:00+00:00,Intel's Comeback Looks Impossible. So Did AMD's.,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intels-comeback-looks-impossible.-so-did-amds.-2021-05-05,,,"Years of manufacturing issues for Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) has led to a situation that would have been unthinkable five years ago: The manufacturing edge the chip giant long enjoyed is gone. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM), which counts Intel rival Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) as a customer, has pulled into what looks like an insurmountable lead.
While Intel is still churning out PC chips built on its now ancient 14nm process, TSMC has been offering its customers 7nm chips for quite some time. Intel won't have 7nm chips of its own until 2023, assuming nothing gets derailed before then.
Intel will spend big in the coming years on manufacturing as it looks to close the gap and launch its own foundry services business. The company is pouring $20 billion into two new facilities in Arizona, and its annual capital spending is right around that $20 billion mark.
But TSMC is spending even bigger. The company plans to spend a whopping $100 billion over the next three years to expand capacity. By the time Intel finally launches its first 7nm chip, TSMC plans to be already mass-producing chips built on a 3nm process. Comparing processes between companies isn't exactly apples-to-apples, but you get the idea.
A comeback for Intel looks downright impossible given TSMC's lead. It will require a lot of things to go right for Intel, and some things to go wrong for its competitors. It's exactly the kind of situation AMD found itself in a few years ago.
Image source: Getty Images.
AMD's comeback looked impossible, too
Let's rewind to 2015. AMD was in awful shape. Revenue plunged 28% that year to just $4 billion, and the company reported a staggering net loss of $660 million . To say that AMD's products weren't competitive with Intel's would be an understatement.
AMD's share of the server chip market had fallen close to zero just as demand from cloud computing providers was starting to heat up. By 2017, AMD was shipping less than 10% of PC chips. The company's Bulldozer architecture, launched in 2011 and revised a few times, was a disaster. Reviewers at Anandtech found one of AMD's early Bulldozer PC chips was outperformed by a comparable Intel chip by as much as 50%.
A comeback for AMD looked like the longest of longshots. Not only did Intel have a manufacturing lead at the time, but it was also designing better chips than AMD.
Today, AMD has come roaring back. The company's Zen architecture is the foundation of its Ryzen PC and EPYC server chips, with the latest iteration of each built on TSMC's 7nm process. AMD has grown its market share considerably, and it grew revenue to nearly $10 billion in 2020. In many cases, AMD's chips are outperforming Intel's chips, and they're using considerably less power thanks to the advanced manufacturing process.
AMD's comeback required a few things to happen. AMD needed to design a better architecture; third-party foundries like TSMC needed to continually launch improved manufacturing processes without issue; and Intel needed to make serious missteps. It all happened, as unlikely as it seemed back in 2015.
Intel can make a comeback; it just won't be easy
Given what AMD has managed, it would be unwise to completely write off Intel. Yes, the company has made a lot of mistakes over the years. Yes, it will take more than Intel getting its manufacturing operation back on track for the company to regain its manufacturing edge. TSMC will probably need to have some missteps of its own.
I can't put odds on Intel's comeback, but I know that it's never a good idea to simply assume whatever is happening now will continue to happen forever. I was dead wrong about AMD's turnaround for exactly that reason. Shares of AMD have gained more than 2,000% over the past five years, by the way.
Intel stock hasn't suffered all that much, so don't expect those kinds of gains if the company can turn itself around. But with Intel trading for just about 12 times the company's adjusted earnings guidance, there's plenty of room to run if things start to go right for the chip giant.

2021-05-05 00:00:00+00:00,2 Top Self-Driving Car Stocks to Buy in 2021,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/2-top-self-driving-car-stocks-to-buy-in-2021-2021-05-05,,,"Each day, nearly 3,700 people die in car accidents around the world; that makes driving the leading cause of death for children and young adults between the ages of 5 and 29 years old, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Moreover, roadway injuries are expected to cost the global economy $1.8 trillion between 2015 and 2030.
While deaths and injuries are certainly the greatest negatives, driving also imposes another cost on the economy: lost productivity. Every minute you spend behind the wheel is a minute that could be spent doing something else.
By dramatically reducing roadway deaths and boosting productivity, autonomous vehicle (AV) technology has the potential to change the world. Investors looking to cash in on this trend should consider NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA). Here's why.
NVIDIA
NVIDIA's graphics processing units (GPUs) are regarded as the gold standard in the AI industry. As evidence, the company recently set records in every category at the MLPerf benchmarks, a series of trials designed to test AI technology. In other words, NVIDIA bested all rivals in both training (learning) and inference (decision making), the two components of artificial intelligence.
NVIDIA DRIVE is an end-to-end platform, combining hardware and software to power autonomous vehicles. The NVIDIA Orin system-on-a-chip (SoC) -- which blends NVIDIA GPUs and ARM central processing units (CPUs) to create a beast that can perform over 250 trillion operations per second (TOPS) -- will hit vehicle production lines by 2022.
Image source: NVIDIA
Even more impressive, the chipmaker recently announced that Orin's successor, Atlan, will be available by 2025, delivering 1,000 TOPS. To put those figures in perspective, Intel-owned Mobileye's latest platform, the EyeQ5, is capable of 24 TOPS -- in other words, it's 10 times less powerful than Orin, and 40 times less powerful than Atlan. Also noteworthy, Orin delivers roughly 3 TOPS per watt, making it more power-efficient than the EyeQ5, which delivers 2.4 TOPS per watt.
NVIDIA also provides the software frameworks necessary for developers to build AV applications. When combined with NVIDIA hardware, these applications enable a vehicle to integrate sensor data (camera, radar, lidar), perceive its surroundings, and move autonomously through its environment. Not surprisingly, Navigant recognized NVIDIA's AV computing platform as the industry leader in a report published in 2020.
NVIDIA already partners with automakers like Audi, Mercedes-Benz, Nio, Toyota, and Volvo, as well as robotaxi companies like Cruise and Zoox. However, given its best-in-class solution, NVIDIA is well positioned to pick up new partners.
Going forward, NVIDIA expects its current customer pipeline to generate north of $8 billion over the next six years, but management believes its addressable market in the AV industry will reach $60 billion by 2030. That leaves a lot of upside for this semiconductor company and its shareholders.
Tesla
Tesla manufactures a variety of electric vehicles, including the most recently released Model Y SUV and Model 3 sedan. Tesla began outfitting its vehicles with the latest autopilot and full self-driving hardware in October 2016: radar, eight cameras, and 12 ultrasonic sensors. That effectively turned Tesla's global fleet into a valuable source of data.
Image source: Tesla
In February 2020, Tesla Director of Artificial Intelligence Andrej Karpathy provided a staggering statistic: The company had collected almost 3 billion miles of real-world driving data. By comparison, Alphabet's Waymo stated it had over 20 million miles of data in March 2020 -- 150 times less than Tesla.
Here's why that matters: Autonomous vehicles rely on powerful hardware and software to run deep neural networks (AI engines), which use input from various sensors to make decisions like when to stop or change lanes. But before these deep neural networks are capable of decision making, they must first be trained with lots of data (i.e. they need to understand when it's necessary to stop or change lanes).
Put simply, Tesla is miles ahead of other automakers in terms of data, and that gives the company a serious advantage when training its deep neural networks. But Tesla also has another advantage: Its platform is more scalable.
Waymo relies on lidar technology to map the world in high-definition; its Waymo One service then uses those maps to orchestrate the safe travel of robotaxis in Phoenix. By comparison, Tesla's approach centers on computer vision, which relies on cameras to collect data, which is then sent back to Tesla and used to improve the decision-making capabilities of its autopilot platform. This approach is much more scalable.
Ultimately, Waymo's method means its vehicles are very good at driving in Phoenix, but they would likely have great difficulty operating outside of that environment -- or if anything drastic changed within the environment, like new construction. By comparison, Tesla's use of cameras makes it platform applicable to a much wider range of geographies and scenarios.
In terms of market opportunity, Cathie Wood's Ark Invest believes autonomous ride-hailing platforms will earn over $1 trillion in annual profits by 2030. Elon Musk has said Tesla is open to licensing its autopilot platform, which would allow the company to tap that massive market. But even if that doesn't happen, Ark believes manufacturers of autonomous vehicles will reap $250 billion in annual profits by 2030. That leaves plenty of upside for Tesla and its shareholders.

OAKLAND, Calif., May 5 (Reuters) - Silicon Valley venture capitalists, long focused on software and internet companies, are again pouring money into the semiconductor industry, lured by the promise of a new generation of artificial-intelligence chips that could challenge incumbents like Intel Corp INTC.O and Nvidia Corp NVDA.O.
The new wave of semiconductor innovation will do little to address the shortage of chips based on older technology that is currently plaguing the auto industry and others. The shortage stems from a confluence of factors as carmakers, which shut plants during the COVID-19 pandemic last year, compete against the sprawling consumer electronics industry for chip supplies.
The enthusiasm for chip startups is mostly a result of the need, by companies using AI software, for special-purpose processors that can efficiently run machine-learning algorithms requiring huge troves of data - the heart of the booming artificial-intelligence business.
Upstart chip-makers including SambaNova Systems, Groq, and Cerebras Systems all say they are making chips that can perform AI tasks better than processors from Nvidia, whose multipurpose graphics chip sets - originally made for video games -now dominate the AI market.
“How can a car be good at being fun to drive and good to take the kids and soccer balls to soccer practice and carry freight and bricks and garbage? The answer is it can't,” said Andrew Feldman, co-founder and CEO of Cerebras Systems, arguing that AI algorithms need specific chips rather than chips that can serve multiple purposes.
Cerebras' innovation is a very large chip, 56 times the size of a postage stamp, that packs 2.6 trillion transistors.
Gartner analyst Alan Priestley has counted over 50 firms now developing chips specifically for AI applications, and said there may be more. He expects the market to be worth over $70 billion by 2025, up from $23 billion in 2020.
Venture funding for U.S. chip startups reached $1.8 billion last year, the highest level in at least two decades, according to data firm PitchBook. Another $1.4 billion has already been invested this year.
In April alone, SambaNova said it raised $676 million for its reconfigurable AI chips. Groq, which boasts of a super-powerful single-core design that is fast and easy to program, announced it had raised $300 million. The CEOs of both companies told Reuters the funding rounds were bigger than planned due to strong investor interest.
The opportunities are now piquing the interest of predominantly software-focused venture capital firms such as Battery Ventures, Bessemer Venture Partners, and Foundation Capital. They were among the most active semiconductor investors over the past two years, said Brendan Burke, analyst at PitchBook.
Battery Ventures' general partner, Dharmesh Thakker, said he started considering chip investments a few years ago after he noticed his AI software companies were all working with Nvidia.
""We said, 'Hey, there might be an opportunity to build another Nvidia in that whole space around AI.'""
Bessemer Venture Partners and Foundation Capital did not respond to requests for comment.
Ian Buck, Nvidia's general manager of accelerated computing, said he is confident the company will stay ahead in the AI chip game. Nvidia GPUs have been evolving over the past seven years to meet AI software needs, with some chips specifically designed to handle AI.
SUBSIDIES BECKON
Peter Barrett, general partner at early-stage investor Playground Global, says new materials and techniques for building chips are driving innovation in areas beyond AI. He cited chips for quantum computers, a new technology that uses subatomic particles to store and process information.
All this activity is coming as the U.S. government finalizes new subsidy programs to support the domestic chip industry. Andy Rappaport, a new board member of Groq who has invested in chips for decades, believes the geopolitical instability and competition between the United States and China could even drive venture capital firms to invest not just in chip design companies but even manufacturing. “If the federal government wants to goose my returns and underwrite my risk, then you could see a credible scenario where a new manufacturing player could emerge,” he said.
That, in turn, could trigger even more bets on chip-design firms. “If I knew manufacturing was no longer an issue, it makes it easier for me to invest in the IC companies,” said venture capitalist Hany Nada of ACME Capital, referring to integrated circuit, or chip, suppliers.
Ironically, with AI chips it is getting easier for AI algorithms to improve chip manufacturing, bring costs down, and open up manufacturing again to startups, said Matthew Putman, who started Nanotronics in 2011 to do exactly that, and had an early investment from Peter Thiel's Founders Fund.
By 2019, Nanotronics had raised about $90 million. And Putnam is no longer worried about where funding will come from.
“In 2013 or 2014 when I would go in and literally if you didn't have an app or any kind of enterprise SaaS software, you wouldn't even get past the receptionist,” he said, adding that was even after Founders Fund had invested. “That has changed, a lot.”

2021-05-04 00:00:00+00:00,Is It Time to Buy the Dow Jones Industrials Average's 3 Worst-Performing Stocks of April?,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/is-it-time-to-buy-the-dow-jones-industrials-averages-3-worst-performing-stocks-of-april,,,"Most investors are always on the hunt for underpriced stocks. After all, who doesn't love a bargain?
However, not every stock that has taken a tumble is necessarily undervalued. Sometimes, those sell-offs are completely merited even when they hit familiar blue chips. One of our key tasks as investors is to separate the market's mispricings from its correct calls -- and it's not easy.
With this in mind, let's consider the three worst-performing components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average in April. Are any of them bargains after their share price declines, or did Wall Street get it right?
Image source: Getty Images.
What went wrong
April's biggest losers among the bluest of the blue chips were Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), down 10%; Boeing (NYSE: BA), down 8%; and Amgen (NASDAQ: AMGN), off by 4%. For perspective, last month the Dow Jones Industrial Average overall gained a little less than 3%.
That trio is a curious mix. Usually, there's at least a semi-clear common thread among the big names logging the worst losses. But, there aren't many similarities between a chipmaker, an aircraft manufacturer, and a pharmaceutical outfit.
There is one common element among these Dow laggards, however: Their recent share price weakness is attributable to disappointing quarterly reports that portend trouble ahead.
Intel's first-quarter numbers weren't terrible. Revenue fell 1% year over year, and operating profits slumped by 6%. Given the challenging, turbulent environment created by the pandemic, however -- and the fact that earnings of $1.39 per share soundly trounced estimates of $1.15 -- those results could be considered a victory.
The small setback was only a taste of the weakness that appears to be on the horizon. Intel is struggling with the same chip shortage most other technology companies are contending with, and is guiding for Q2 revenue of $17.8 billion and per-share profits of $1.05. While that sales outlook is better than analysts' estimates, the bottom-line projection is worse, which indicates its production expenses are rising. The company's full-year guidance suggests its problems will persist for a while.
As for Boeing, the beleaguered maker of passenger jets managed last quarter to deflect some of the impact of the pandemic in a way it wasn't able to navigate its many headwinds a year prior. In Q1 2020, it booked an operating loss of more than $1.3 billion. This past quarter, it whittled the red ink down to just a bit less than breakeven.
The loss was still bigger than analysts had expected, however, and Boeing confirmed in its report that some 737 MAX jets had been grounded (again) due to electrical issues, while deliveries of new ones have been halted until these potential problems can be fixed. The news didn't hit shares especially hard, but it did contribute to what's now nearly a 16% setback from March's peak price.
And Amgen? To the company's credit, its stock is starting to rebound, but that effort has yet to wipe away most of the 7% selloff that hit it last week after the drugmaker not only fell short of Q1's revenue and earnings estimates, but posted lower year-over-year top-and bottom-line numbers due to lower drug prices. And in the current environment, no pharmaceutical company can afford to lose pricing power.
To buy, or not to buy
The $64,000 question: Are these stocks' sell-offs buying opportunities?
Let's consider Intel first. While the worldwide chip shortage is a key reason for its recent weakness, it shouldn't be ignored that rivals Advanced Micro Devices and NVIDIA are now both contenders in the data center space that Intel used to dominate. In fact, its data center sales fell 20% last quarter. While the company is built to last, this competitive headwind won't be quickly or easily overcome. Never mind the chip shortage itself, which remains a bit tough to forecast.
Meanwhile, Boeing continues to talk about a bright future where air travel is robust again, and to be fair, passenger traffic is picking up. It will be years before the business fully recovers to pre-pandemic levels though. In the meantime, the company must deal with another issue involving its 737 MAX jets, which at one point were expected to usher in the next era of passenger travel and fuel optimization. That's another dent to Boeing's credibility that it just doesn't need.
The common element between Boeing and Intel is the one investors can tolerate the least -- uncertainty.
That's not quite the case for Amgen. Sure, its declining pricing power is a concern. As Jefferies analyst Michael Yee pointed out to Reuters though, prices ""are typically weakest in the first quarter due to seasonality in patient volumes and then bounce in Q2 on a recovery in buying patterns and patient volumes.""
That jibes with a comment made by Amgen CEO Robert Bradway during the company's Q1 conference call: ""We felt the impact of the pandemic in January and February, and we began to see a recovery in March, a trend that seems to be holding in April as well.""
Throw in this company's reliable growth, a forward price-to-earnings ratio in the mid-teens, and a dividend of just under 3%, and this is the one stock out of these three Dow that I'd say would make for a smart addition to most people's portfolios.

Semiconductor stocks performed extremely well in the stock market in 2020. And analysts are expecting more great things in the industry in 2021. Simply put, the tech sector continues to thrive because it owes its massive success in no small part to the semiconductor industry. This was likely due to a surge in demand for all things digital as more people were forced to stay at home due to the pandemic. 
Some of the top semiconductor stocks like Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) fell despite topping Wall Street estimates with their first-quarter earnings last week. But there isn’t a need to write them off just yet. In fact, the pull-back provides some great entry points for investors. And a lot of that pull-back could have something to do with the chip shortages. However, if you have a long-term horizon, it’s safe to assume that technology is only going to continue to grow. 
With the increasing digitization of the things we are using on a daily basis, we simply can’t ignore the fact that our life is increasingly dependent on semiconductors. Be it your favorite electric vehicles or the new Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) products that you are anticipating, all of them need semiconductors. In addition, the rising popularity of cryptocurrencies has also resulted in shortages of graphic cards as miners buy them in bulk. That said, the surge of demand for these products is likely to bode well for the companies manufacturing them. With all these in mind, do you have this list of top semiconductor stocks to buy in the stock market today?
Top Semiconductors To Watch This Week
Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC)
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE: TSM)
NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA)
Entegris (NASDAQ: ENTG)
Intel Corporation
Intel is a semiconductor titan that needs no introduction. The company recently reported its first-quarter earnings where revenue came in 1% lower year-over-year to $19.7 billion. Intel’s first-quarter growth cleared Wall Street’s low bar, but its mixed guidance signaled its troubles would persist throughout this year. Following this report, INTC stock has been on a steady decline. But could its recent capital expenditure plans turn things around for the stock?
Source: TD Ameritrade TOS
The company plans to spend more money on building semiconductors and less on stock buybacks. In March, the CEO announced plans for a $20 billion expansion of Intel’s chip-making facility in Arizona. Now, Intel is aiming to begin manufacturing most of its products in-house. But it will still increase its use of third-party fabricators.
Intel also said on Sunday that it will spend $3.5 billion on an upgrade for its factory in New Mexico. This is part of a plan to expand the company’s domestic manufacturing investments. With Intel looking to build more of its chips in the U.S., would you consider INTC stock to be an undervalued stock if you have a long-term horizon?

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing 
Another top semiconductor stock to watch now would be the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM). Notably, TSM is the largest semiconductor manufacturer globally. Accordingly, you could argue that it would stand to benefit significantly from increasing worldwide demands for semiconductors. But its recent price action is certainly holding investors from diving right in.
Source: TD Ameritrade TOS
While the fundamentals suggest a screaming buy, the stock has been moving sideways in recent weeks. From its first-quarter report, TSM’s sales came in 16.7% higher year over year to $12.7 billion. It was the company’s third straight quarter of record sales as the global economy rebounds from the coronavirus pandemic. If any indication, TSM is growing fast, especially for a company of its size. 
Despite its sizable gains over the past year, TSM does not seem to be resting on its laurels. For the uninitiated, 75% of TSM’s first-quarter revenue came from smartphones and high-performance computing. More impressively, the company is also seeing rapid growth in other industries like the Internet of Things (IoT) and automotive. Admittedly, TSM stock may not be cheap at a P/E ratio of 31 times. But with its market-leading position and growth trajectory, would you pick up TSM stock as it slides?

Entegris
With a pressing issue like global chip shortage, it doesn’t take a genius to know that semiconductor companies are trying to ramp up production to meet demand. Therefore, semiconductor companies may be looking for ways to mass-produce with lower costs and improved performance. And that’s when advanced materials and process solutions company Entegris comes into the picture. 
Source: TD Ameritrade TOS
The company generates most of its revenue from semiconductor manufacturers. Having said that, I guess it’s safe to say that Entegris is a pure-play on the ramp-up in semiconductor chips globally. The more semiconductor manufacturers plan to increase their supply, the more Entegris stands to benefit. From its latestearnings call the company’s management upgraded its expectations for its end markets to grow 13% to 14% in 2021 versus a previous estimate of 7% to 8%.
If the strong management guidance is not convincing enough, Wall Street analysts also expect the company’s sales to hit $2.4 billion in the coming year. These analysts appear very confident that ENTG stock will receive a boost when many semiconductor manufacturers are scrambling to increase their production capacity. You could also think of ENTG stock as a pick-and-shovel play in the space. Considering all these, will you be watching ENTG stock?

2021-05-04 00:00:00+00:00,Intel Announces Massive Investments In Improving Its Products,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intel-announces-massive-investments-in-improving-its-products-2021-05-04,,,"Intel (INTC) has announced massive plans for investments in improving its products.
The technology company will spend $3.5 billion to enhance the manufacturing of advanced semiconductor packaging technologies in its New Mexico plant. The investment will also target the enhancement of the company’s breakthrough 3D packaging technology.
Construction at the Rio Rancho Campus in New Mexico, as part of the investment, is set to start later in the year. The investment should result in the creation of 700 high-tech jobs and 1,000 construction jobs. It will also support an additional 3,500 jobs in the local community.
Intel is moving to enhance its manufacturing capacity in New Mexico as it seeks to remain competitive in the semiconductor industry. The investment is part of the company’s IDM 2.0 strategy that calls for product optimization.
“A key differentiator for our IDM 2.0 strategy is our unquestioned leadership in advanced packaging, which allows us to mix and match compute tiles to deliver the best products. We’re seeing tremendous interest in these capabilities from the industry, especially following the introduction of our new Intel Foundry Services,"" said Keyvan Esfarjani, Intel’s SVP and GM of Manufacturing and Operations.
In addition to the New Mexico investment, Intel is also investing $600 million as it seeks to ramp up its research and development (R&D) operations in Israel. Reuters reports that the company is inclined to turn its Mobileye unit into an R&D campus. As part of the transformation, the chip giant will spend $400 million enhancing the facility so it can start developing self-driving car technologies.
The remaining $200 million will go towards constructing a new R&D center in the northern port city of Haifa. Reuters also reports that the chip giant is poised to spend $10 billion on a new chip plant in Israel. (See Intel stock analysis on TipRanks)
Additionally, Intel has planned multibillion-dollar expansions at its sites in Arizona, Oregon and Ireland.
Northland Securities analyst Gus Richard reiterated a Sell rating on Intel, although it reported a strong quarter, supported by record notebook shipments that were up 54%.
“INTC is losing high-end share to AMD and x86 is losing share to ARM. We do not think entering the foundry business or government money will solve INTC problems any time soon,"" Richard wrote.
The analyst has a $42 price target on the stock, implying 27% downside potential to current levels.
The consensus among analysts is a Hold based on 12 Buy, 10 Hold, and 8 Sell ratings. The average analyst price target of $67.19 implies a 16.79% upside potential to current levels.
INTC scores 9 out of 10 on TipRanks’ Smart Score rating system, implying it is likely to outperform the overall market.

2021-05-03 00:00:00+00:00,"Forget Intel, Buy These 2 Semiconductor Stocks Instead",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/forget-intel-buy-these-2-semiconductor-stocks-instead-2021-05-03,,,"Intel's (NASDAQ: INTC) stock recently slumped after the chipmaker posted its first-quarter earnings report. Its revenue and earnings surpassed Wall Street's conservative estimates, but its guidance indicated its slowdown would continue as it grappled with its chip shortage and R&D issues.
Intel's manufacturing plans, which include investments in new plants and the launch of a new foundry unit for third-party chipmakers, also defied calls for the company to become a fabless chipmaker like Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD).
Intel also postponed the launch of its long-delayed 7nm chips to 2023, which indicates it will fall further behind Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) and Samsung in the ""process race"" to manufacture smaller and more advanced chips. Intel will also reportedly rely on TSMC's plants to produce those 7nm CPUs.
Image source: Getty Images.
Factoring in all these challenges, Intel expects its adjusted revenue and earnings to decline 7% and 13%, respectively, for the full year. Intel's stock might look like a bargain right now at 13 times forward earnings while paying a forward dividend yield of 2.4%, but it's cheap for obvious reasons.
Instead of waiting for Intel's glacial turnaround efforts to possibly bear fruit, investors should simply buy AMD or NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) as their main semiconductor plays instead.
1. AMD is catching up to Intel again
AMD is a fabless chipmaker that outsources the production of its chips to third-party foundries like TSMC. Intel manufactures most of its chips internally, but its own foundries struggled to make the more efficient chips that TSMC specializes in.
As Intel postponed its latest chips and struggled with shortages, AMD pulled ahead of Intel in the process race by using TSMC's superior plants. Many PC makers then started using AMD's chips instead of Intel's.
As a result, AMD's share of the x86 CPU market rose from 20.2% to 38.4% between the second quarters of 2017 and 2021, according to PassMark Software. Intel's share dropped from 79.7% to 61.5%.
Image source: Getty Images.
AMD's latest Ryzen and EPYC CPUs are built on TSMC's 7nm process, putting it one generation ahead of Intel, even though Intel claims its 10nm node is comparable to TSMC's 7nm node. But AMD will likely launch its new 5nm CPUs later this year, which will put it firmly ahead of Intel's 10nm chips.
AMD's revenue rose 45% to $9.76 billion last year. Its computing and graphics revenue rose 37% to $6.43 billion, fueled by robust demand for its Ryzen CPUs and Radeon GPUs. Its EESC (enterprise, embedded, and semi-custom) revenue soared 65% to $3.33 billion as it sold more EPYC server chips and custom chips for new gaming consoles. Its adjusted earnings more than doubled.
Wall Street expects AMD's revenue and earnings to rise another 48% and 67%, respectively, this year, as it continues to gain ground against Intel in the PC and data center markets. It will also likely keep pace with NVIDIA in the high-end GPU market, which should benefit from the launches of new games and demand for new cryptocurrency mining cards.
2. NVIDIA is becoming a disruptive superpower
Like AMD, NVIDIA is a fabless chipmaker that relies on TSMC and Samsung instead of manufacturing its own chips.
NVIDIA's brand is often associated with gaming GPUs, but it also supplies high-end GPUs to data centers for AI and machine learning tasks. Its smaller Arm-based CPU business sells Tegra CPUs for embedded systems and Grace CPUs for servers, while its recent takeover of Mellanox expands its data center business with sales of networking equipment.
NVIDIA's revenue surged 53% to $16.7 billion in fiscal 2021, which ended this January, as its adjusted earnings soared 73%. Its strong sales of GPUs for gaming PCs and data centers offset softer sales of its professional visualization and automotive chips throughout the pandemic.
Analysts expect NVIDIA's revenue and earnings to rise 34% and 35%, respectively, this year. But those estimates likely haven't factored in its planned $40 billion purchase of Arm Holdings, the U.K.-based chip designer that provides the architecture for nearly all of the world's mobile devices, from the Japanese conglomerate SoftBank (OTC: SFTBF).
That proposed takeover faces a lot of regulatory challenges, but it could transform NVIDIA into a semiconductor superpower, for two reasons. First, all of the world's Arm-based chipmakers would need to pay NVIDIA high-margin royalties and licensing fees. Second, it could design and manufacture new high-end Arm chips -- like its new Grace CPU -- to challenge Intel and AMD in the PC and data center markets.
The bottom line
AMD and NVIDIA trade at about 30 and 40 times forward earnings, respectively. AMD doesn't pay a dividend, while NVIDIA pays a tiny forward dividend yield of 0.1%.
Value-seeking investors might shy away from those higher valuations and stick with Intel, but that would be a mistake. AMD and NVIDIA deserve their premium valuations, and they should continue to grow as Intel struggles to undo years of bad management decisions.

Strong demand for electronics fueled unprecedented shortages of semiconductors. And the novel coronavirus pandemic has played a part.
When the pandemic started more than over a year ago, companies re-positioned workers to stay at home. That increased sales of computers, which led to shortages in semiconductors. And in other industries like automotive, increased demand for chip components is pressuring the sector. ]
Meanwhile, the advent of 5G ushers an era of low latency. Besides the connected vehicle, automakers added more safety features, infotainment, and other functions that need more computer chips.
7 Homebuilding Stocks to Buy That Are Ready for Another Round of Gains
For months, experts identified the global semiconductor shortage. Companies that rely on them have to cut production until supplies increase. That could take a few quarters, at least. Investors have seven stocks to buy until the semiconductor shortage ceases. The companies, in alphabetical order, are:
Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT)
Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO)
Intel (NASDAQ:INTC)
Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU)
NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA)
Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM)
Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM)
Semiconductor stocks have strong overall scores
Chart courtesy of Stock Rover
In the table, for all of the semiconductors, investors may consider buying sore a 79/100 or higher overall. The average score is 85.
Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor score the lowest on value but make up for that with an exceptionally strong growth scores. Investors are willing to pay more for both stocks. The shortage will lift their profit margins, which is a tailwind for the stock.

Applied highlighted five key takeaways at an investor presentation. The artificial intelligence era will lead to secular growth and a push for innovation. It sees itself as a performance, area, cost, and time to market (PPACt) company. The new PPACt playbook will benefit customers and partners as it delivers a portfolio of innovative products to market.
Investors should expect visible revenue in the quarters ahead. Applied will shift more of its business to a subscription-style revenue model. On the balance sheet, the business growth will result in better free cash flow.
Applied is operating on the forecast that earnings per share will exceed revenue growth by a multiple of 1.7 times to 2 times.
AMAT stock already rose steadily, reflecting the digital transformation phase lifting growth for years to come. And in this data-centric world, automation, AI, and the industrial Internet of Things will only increase demand.
Broadcom (AVGO)

Stuck mostly in a trading range, Broadcom is poised to break out. On its Q1/2021 conference call, Chief Executive Officer Hock Tan highlighted the strong backlog. He said that it is stretching its lead times. Customers are responding by pushing orders further out.
AVGO could manage its supply and demand balances better. But with revenue growing by 17% year-on-year, it may enjoy the 90% bookings for 2021. Bookings grew by 63%, so instead of increasing supply, it will better communicate the next generation products to customers. That will help customers ease orders, balance the need for getting products sooner or waiting for improved ones later.
7 Homebuilding Stocks to Buy That Are Ready for Another Round of Gains
The strong growth in the wireless market is another tailwind for AVGO stock. So, instead of trying to meet the strong demand, the company is extending the product lead time. Customers will continue to book orders based on the demand they are seeing. Broadcom benefits from keeping its booking levels elevated while management mobile chip development activities.
Semiconductors: Intel (INTC)

Intel, seen as the laggard in the PC chip space, showed no evidence of weakness when it reported first-quarter results. Revenue fell slightly by 0.7% YoY to $19.7 billion. It earned $1.39 a share on a non-GAAP basis.
The chip giant raised its full-year 2021 guidance. It now expects revenue will top $77 billion. GAAP EPS will be $4. For the second quarter, revenue will meet consensus estimates at $17.8 billion.
Mobileye is proving a smart acquisition. Revenue rose by 48% to $377 million (per page 2). Conversely, the data center group posted revenue of $5.6 billion, down 20% YoY. EPYC’s powerful server product from Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is a headwind for the unit. Still, the consumer computer division is Intel’s biggest revenue generator. The unit benefited from strong demand of 2-in-1, thin-and-light, commercial and gaming, and connectivity and graphics.
Intel is the cheapest semiconductor stock in the over-valued sector. Investors could buy INTC stock as it corrects again. When it announces a CPU refresh, ending the many months of delays, the stock will move higher.
Micron Technology (MU)

Micron Technology traded in a wide range for much of 2021. MU stock has a good chance of breaking out and resuming an uptrend due to the chip shortage.
On the Q2/2021 conference call, CEO Sanjay Mehrotra said that the DRAM market is in severe shortage. The NAND market, however, is stabilizing in the near term. The CEO has plans for managing the macro tailwinds from the non-memory component shortages in the electronics industry. It is enhancing the production process. For example, it will secure alternative sources of water while conserving water usage.
Micron does not expect to have any DRAM production output problems. In the last quarter, the company managed to deliver record PC DRAM bit shipments. Sampling the latest DDR4 products should lift margins in the quarters ahead.
7 Homebuilding Stocks to Buy That Are Ready for Another Round of Gains
Micron will not raise capital expenditures by much despite the shortage across all end markets and the demand there. This is the safest approach. Instead of facing future risks of a supply glut following the end of the chip shortage, Micron will sell products and keep DRAM in short supply.
Semiconductors: Nvidia (NVDA)
Source: michelmond / Shutterstock.com
Nvidia said that its first quarter will track above its outlook. It now expects Q1 revenue of above the $5.3 billion outlook. Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress said the company is “experiencing broad-based strength, with all our market platforms driving upside to our initial outlook.”
Data center will boost results again this year. Industries continue to use more AI in their products and services. The chip shortage is not a headwind for Nvidia. Investors may shield themselves from the industry imbalance by holding NVDA stock throughout this year.
Nvidia’s EGX enterprise platform is another tailwind. To capitalize on strong demand in the data center, cloud, and the edge, Nvidia’s end-to-end platform will gain from exposure to all growth markets. They are data center AI, edge AI, data analytics, professional visualization, and omniverse.
Nvidia’s 2023 launch of a CPU named Grace is a positive catalyst. This is the company’s first data-center CPU. While the product may face heavy competition from Intel and AMD, it will complement Nvidia’s GPU and data processing unit products.
Qualcomm (QCOM)

Qualcomm shares stalled in recent weeks when markets worried about the end of the cycle for semiconductors. This bearishness is short-sighted.
Qualcomm is in the early innings of benefiting from the 5G super cycle. It also has opportunities in the explosive growth of IoT and connected mobility (connected car). In March, the chip giant announced the launch of Snapdragon 780G. This will add powerful AI performance and better camera capabilities for smartphone devices. The product refresh reaffirms Qualcomm’s strength in the 5G handset market. 5G adoption is a long-term opportunity.
The company forecast shipments of 3.8 billion between 2020-2024 (per slide 9). Investors should consider this as a conservative forecast. Mobile technology is converging, driven by the digital economy. 5G is a key player in the ongoing shift to mobile.
7 Homebuilding Stocks to Buy That Are Ready for Another Round of Gains
On Wall Street, the average price target is around $170 (according to Tipranks). QCOM stock trades at a price-to-earnings in the low 20s and is attractive here.
Semiconductors: Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM)

Taiwan Semiconductor is proactively growing its market share in light of the chip shortage. It is expanding the capacity of mature process technology. The company’s bet that the supply shortage will pay off until at least year-end 2022.
Taiwan Semiconductor allocated $2.89 billion for the capacity expansion. Tight foundry capacity is disrupting the integrated circuit designers. TSM may increase revenue by increasing output to take advantage of the higher materials and fab services costs.
TSM will expand its capacity for the 28nm process at its China fab. The investment is small because excess demand for the mature technology process will not last long. Demand for 7nm to 14nm, for example, will rise steadily. So, TSM will maximize profits by address strong demand across the different levels of manufacturing processes.
Wall Street is cautious on TSM stock. The average price target is $83, according to Tipranks.

Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) CEO Lisa Su is the hottest name in tech. Even though AMD stock is down 11% in 2021, analysts keep pounding the table for it.

On April 27 they were rewarded with net income of $642 million, 52 cents per share on revenue of $3.45 billion. The sales figure was up 94% from a year ago.
AMD stock is weak only because it already has a nosebleed valuation. In the days after the release AMD stock fell another 2%. It’s now near $82 per share with a market cap of $102 billion, on what could be $13.7 billion in sales if they can hold that pace. That’s a forward price-sales ratio of 7.4x, and a price-earnings ratio of 83x.
Investors Like Intel
I’m one of the investors Wall Street analysts like Jim Cramer don’t understand. He reiterated a buy call on AMD after earnings. Yet since the start of the year Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) shares are up 17%, after the company hired former VMware (NYSE:VMW) CEO Pat Gelsinger to run it.
Gelsinger plans to put $20 billion into making Intel a chip foundry. His target is Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM), which makes AMD chips. TSMC, as it’s called, is also raising its capital budget, to over $25 billion. The two companies are racing each other in the desert southeast of Phoenix to build fabrication plants.
10 of the Top Nasdaq Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy
AMD designs have passed those of Intel in performance. Its road map now includes a chip with circuit lines just 3 nanometers apart, while Intel is still stuck at 10 nanometers. That chip could hit the market as early as 2024. I believe, hover, that Intel will match TSMC, benefitting from President Joe Biden’s demand that American computer makers buy American.
Want another reason to buy Intel? Unlike AMD it pays a dividend. Even with its recent rise in price it’s still yielding 2.4%.
No Fab, No Problem
Like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), 2020’s other hot hand in the semiconductor space, AMD is “fabless.” That means it’s purely a chip designer, a software house. It relies on other companies to do the capital-intensive job of manufacturing its product.
For the analysts who love it this means AMD’s small size is no problem. AMD ended 2020 with $2.3 billion in cash, but just $531 million in long-term debt. Even the semiconductor shortage is no problem. It just keeps AMD’s prices strong.
AMD has 16 analysts following it at Tipranks, nine of whom say buy it with a one-year price target of $106, up 26%. Intel, meanwhile, has 30 analysts at Tipranks, 12 of whom say buy it with a price target of $67, up 12%.
The Bottom Line
I still prefer Intel, but I can see myself buying AMD. I also own some TSMC, and Nvidia.
As Su says, “This is a very unique time in the semiconductor business.” The rise of self-driving cars, the power of the cloud market, the machine internet and the ubiquity of mobile devices have created a perfect storm around every semiconductor stock.
Chips are traditionally a boom-and-bust area. The investments of TSMC and Intel in Arizona are going to ease the current shortage at some time. They will likely overshoot. Analysts and investors see a glut of product ahead. Others are worried about the big cloud companies. Both AMD and Intel have a fraction of the market cap of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and the other cloud stocks. Most now design their own chips. But all of them need fabrication plants.
The worries are the best reason to buy now. Not everyone is in this market. You should be.

2021-05-02 00:00:00+00:00,Intel will 'focus' less on buying back company stock -CEO,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intel-will-focus-less-on-buying-back-company-stock-ceo-2021-05-02,,,"NEW YORK, May 2 (Reuters) - The chief executive of the biggest U.S. chip-maker, Intel Corp INTC.O, said the company is going to curb its focus on buying back its own stock.
""We will not be anywhere near as focused on buybacks going forward as we have in the past,"" Intel Chief Executive Officer Pat Gelsinger said in an interview on the CBS news magazine ""60 Minutes"" to air on Sunday night.
Gelsinger's comments were in response to a question comparing how much Intel has spent buying its own stock compared to its investment in research and development.
A global shortage of semiconductor chips, critical in cars, laptops and other major consumer products, has put a spotlight on Intel, the only major U.S. chip manufacturer.
In the first quarter, Intel spent $2.3 billion on share repurchases, according to Bloomberg, which first reported Gelsinger's comments.
The new CEO said in March that Intel will spend up to $20 billion to build two new factories in Arizona, greatly expanding its advanced chip manufacturing capacity. The majority of chips are currently produced in Asia.
According to a transcript of the ""60 Minutes"" interview, Gelsinger said Intel is also planning to reconfigure some factories to make chips for cars. Ford Motor Co F.N, General Motors Co GM.N and other automakers have cut production due to the shortage.
Intel's board of directors support the move to curtail stock buybacks, Gelsinger said.

2021-05-02 00:00:00+00:00,"Intel to invest $600 mln to expand chip, Mobileye R&D in Israel",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intel-to-invest-%24600-mln-to-expand-chip-mobileye-rd-in-israel-2021-05-02,,,"By Steven Scheer
JERUSALEM, May 2 (Reuters) - Intel Corp INTC.O said on Sunday it will invest another $600 million in Israel to expand its research and development (R&D) and confirmed it was spending $10 billion on a new chip plant.
The announcement was made during a one-day visit to Israel by Intel Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger as part of a European tour that included Germany and Belgium last week.
Intel is investing $400 million to turn its Mobileye unit headquartered in Jerusalem into an R&D campus for developing self-driving car technologies.
Another $200 million will be invested in building an R&D centre, called IDC12, in the northern port city of Haifa next to its current development centre.
Intel said the ""mega chip design"" facility will have a capacity of 6,000 employees.
Gelsinger, on his first European tour since taking charge of the company in February, in a statement issued on Sunday predicted ""a vibrant future for Intel and Israel for decades to come"".
In recent years, Intel has bought three Israeli tech companies - Mobileye in 2017 for more than $15 billion, artificial intelligence chipmaker Habana in 2019 for $2 billion and Moovit a year ago for $1 billion.
During his brief visit, Gelsinger met with Intel and Mobileye management and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
Israel's Finance Ministry in early 2019 said Intel would get a $1 billion grant to build an $11 billion chip plant, although at the time Intel would not confirm the amount.
On Sunday, Intel said investment would be $10 billion and the first phase of construction has begun.
Its current Fab 28 plant at the company's Kiryat Gat site produces 10 nanometre (nm) chips.
Intel has not disclosed whether the new plant will produce smaller chips, which can increase efficiency, but in March it said it was building two 7 nm chip plants in Arizona for some $20 billion.
Intel Israel's exports grew to a record $8 billion in 2020 from $6.6 billion in 2019, accounting for 14% of total high-tech exports and 2% of Israel's GDP.
Intel is the largest employer of Israel's high tech industry with nearly 14,000 workers.
