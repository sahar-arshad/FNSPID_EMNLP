2021-08-24 00:00:00+00:00,U.S. near deal for Nvidia supercomputer as it waits for delayed Intel machine -sources,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/u.s.-near-deal-for-nvidia-supercomputer-as-it-waits-for-delayed-intel-machine-sources-2021,,,"By Stephen Nellis
Aug 24 (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Energy is nearing a deal to purchase a supercomputer made with chips from Nvidia Corp NVDA.O and Advanced Micro Devices Inc AMD.O as a key lab waits for a larger supercomputer from Intel Corp INTC.O that has been delayed for months, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters.
The Nvidia and AMD machine, to be called Polaris, will not be a replacement for the Intel-based Aurora machine slated for the Argonne National Lab near Chicago, which was poised to be the nation's fastest computer when announced in 2019. Instead, Polaris, which will come online this year, will be a test machine for Argonne to start readying its software for the Intel machine, the people familiar with the matter said.
Argonne spokesperson Ben Schiltz did not immediately respond to a request for comment, nor did Nvidia spokesperson Hector Marinez or AMD spokesperson Aaron Grabein.
Intel, AMD and Nvidia are battling for market share for chips used in data centers. The United States' array of supercomputers do scientific work for healthcare, climate and other researchers, as well as performing virtual testing of the country's nuclear weapons.
Key technologies pioneered in the systems often filter down to commercial data centers in subsequent years, giving an advantage to chip companies which win the contract work.
When Aurora was first announced, Intel and Argonne said the machine would be delivered in 2021, but Intel still has not delivered the key Ponte Vecchio and Sapphire Rapids chips. Intel said in June that the Sapphire Rapids chips would not be in production until 2022, and on Tuesday Intel spokesperson Will Moss said the company remained committed to delivering the computer in 2022.
The $500 million contract called for Intel and partners to deliver a computer with so-called exaflop performance, or the ability to perform 1 quintillion - or 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 - calculations per second. Now, the first exascale computer in the United States will likely be a different machine at a different lab - Oak Ridge National Lab in Tennessee - built by Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co HPE.N with chips from AMD expected to be delivered later this year.
The Polaris machine at Argonne will not be as powerful as the Intel machine, the sources said. Based on Nvidia's A100 chips and AMD's Rome and Milan chips, the Polaris computer will be able to make some exaflop calculations but mostly work at slower speeds.

2021-08-24 00:00:00+00:00,Wistron partners with India's Optiemus in boost for electronics manufacturing,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/wistron-partners-with-indias-optiemus-in-boost-for-electronics-manufacturing-2021-08-24-0,,,"By Sankalp Phartiyal
NEW DELHI, Aug 24 (Reuters) - Wistron Corp 3231.TW of Taiwan is partnering with India's Optiemus Electronics OPTI.NS to build products such as smartphones and laptops, a boost to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's push to make the country an electronics manufacturing hub.
As part of the deal with contract manufacturer Wistron, Optiemus will invest roughly $200 million to ramp up electronics manufacturing in the next three to five years, the two companies said.
The partnership is expected to yield revenues of 380 billion rupees ($5.13 billion) over five years for Optiemus, the company said, adding that it plans to hire roughly 11,000 workers for its two plants on the outskirts of New Delhi. It has a workforce of just about 300 now.
""Wistron wants to grow its footprint in India, Optiemus wants to leverage the government initiatives (in electronics manufacturing)... so it makes sense to come together from a win-win point of view,"" Optiemus managing director A Gururaj, who once led Wistron in India, told Reuters.
The success of India's electronics manufacturing sector is key to Modi's ambition of turning the country into the factory of the world, like neighbouring China.
To boost exports, Modi has announced production linked-incentive (PLI) programmes that pay manufacturers for sales of locally made goods.
Although foreign companies need to make phones and laptops above a certain value to get PLI benefits, there is no such threshold for Indian companies.
That means Wistron and Optiemus, which have won PLI approvals for smartphones and IT products, can make cheaper products and still get the government incentives.
""Optiemus is very advanced discussions with a large global company to make smartphones,"" said Gururaj, declining to name the client.
EXPANSION PUSH
The Wistron-Optiemus partnership is also key to Wistron's business ambitions in India, which have so far rested largely on Apple, its key client in the South Asian nation.
Wistron entered India in 2015 by buying a minority equity stake in Optiemus in a partnership that assembled devices for brands including Taiwan's HTC 2498.TW and South Korea's LG 066570.KS. Wistron has since sold its equity back to Optiemus.
On Tuesday, Gururaj told a news conference that the two companies were open to conversations about financing for Optiemus or an equity stake sale in the Indian firm. He did not share specifics.
In 2017, Wistron began assembling iPhones in a small plant in the southern tech hub of Bengaluru and has since expanded to a much bigger factory in Karnataka state's Narasapura industrial area.
Worker discontent over unpaid wages led to a riot at the Narasapura factory late last year, leading Apple to put Wistron on probation.
""Wistron's partnership with Optiemus will help it scale and diversify manufacturing in India to other products beyond smartphones phones and key client Apple as well as assemble devices locally for other global clients,"" said Neil Shah of Hong Kong-based tech analytics firm Counterpoint Research.
Apart from being a key Apple supplier, Wistron also makes laptops for Dell DVMT.N, Xiaomi 1810.HK, Acer 2353.TW and Intel-based servers.

2021-08-24 00:00:00+00:00,"AMD Is Stealing Market Share From Intel, and It's Not Stopping Now",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/amd-is-stealing-market-share-from-intel-and-its-not-stopping-now-2021-08-24,,,"Intel's (NASDAQ: INTC) recovery in the x86 CPU (central processing unit) market at the end of 2020 now appears to be a flash in the pan. Intel had given investors hope that it could bring an end to Advanced Micro Devices' (NASDAQ: AMD) consistent market share gains by ramping up production and catering to customers who were unable to buy the latter's chips due to a supply shortage, but the latest numbers from Mercury Research prove otherwise.
AMD ate into Intel's x86 market share in the second quarter of 2021, with its share now close to all-time highs. The bad news for Intel investors is that AMD isn't done chomping away at ""Chipzilla's dominance. Let's see why.
Image source: Getty Images
AMD wins big thanks to the server market
According to Mercury Research, AMD held 22.5% of the overall x86 CPU market at the end of Q2, its highest share in the past 14 years. AMD's share increased an impressive 4.2 percentage points year year and 1.8 percentage points from the first quarter. Intel held the rest of the market.
AMD's market share gains were driven primarily by the server market. The chipmaker's server market share increased 3.7 percentage points over the year-ago period to 9.5% in Q2. This isn't surprising, as AMD's latest generation of EPYC server processors is reportedly much faster than Intel's offerings. AMD had claimed that its third-generation EPYC processors offer double the performance of their Intel counterparts.
Those claims are translating into real-world gains. AMD's EPYC server chips are gaining prominence in the world's top 500 supercomputers. The chipmaker supplied 59% of the processing cores to new supercomputer systems in the top 500 list in June 2021, up from 46% in November of last year.
Additionally, AMD had pointed out in its July earnings conference call that server chip demand has accelerated on the back of ""growing internal workload adoption and nearly 50 new AMD-powered instances by Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Google, Tencent and Alibaba."" The company further added that enterprise demand for its server processors is set to accelerate as more than 100 systems powered by its third-generation EPYC servers are in production from the likes of Dell, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Lenovo, Supermicro, Cisco, and others.
More importantly, AMD's relentless pursuit of share in the server market is likely to get a shot in the arm when it launches its fourth-generation EPYC server chips, codenamed Genoa, based on a 5-nanometer manufacturing process next year. The fourth-gen server chips are expected to pack a maximum of 96 cores as compared to 64 cores in the current-generation chips, indicating a nice jump in performance.
Meanwhile, Intel had announced at the end of June that the launch of its next-generation Sapphire Rapids server CPUs has been delayed to the first quarter of 2022. Intel's next-generation server CPUs will be based on a 10nm manufacturing process, which means that Chipzilla will be at a disadvantage when AMD launches its 5nm processors. That's because a smaller node size will allow AMD to pack in more transistors and reduce power consumption, which will result in a higher core count and superior computing power.
The good part is that AMD's share of the server processor market is still quite small, as Intel commanded just over 90% of the space last quarter. That allows AMD to make big gains in this space in the future thanks to its technological advantage. Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya sees AMD's server market share jumping to 25% over the next 12 to 18 months, which would be more than double the current levels.
Gauging the financial gains
AMD sees a total addressable market worth $19 billion in server CPUs by 2023. The company's data center business (which is predominantly composed of server chips in 2020) cornered a high-teens share of its total revenue last year. AMD had generated $9.76 billion in revenue last year, which means that server CPUs produced less than $2 billion of its total sales (assuming the data center segment produced 19% of total revenue).
If AMD indeed goes on to capture 25% of the server CPU market by the end of 2022 as Bank of America forecasts, its revenue from this space could more than double (based on the addressable market figure mentioned above) in the next two years. More importantly, the pace of AMD's server growth and the product roadmap indicate that it can indeed go on to corner a fourth of the server CPU market and boost its top line.
Throw in AMD's gains in the notebook and desktop CPU markets, and it isn't surprising to see why the company's revenue and earnings are anticipated to explode in the coming years.

In all, AMD is sitting on multiple catalysts that could help it remain a top growth stock in the future, and investors would do well to buy it now given the sharp pullback in its share price over the past couple of weeks.

2021-08-24 00:00:00+00:00,"Nvidia: Buy It for Gaming, Hold It for Data Centers",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/nvidia%3A-buy-it-for-gaming-hold-it-for-data-centers-2021-08-24,,,"Too many computer hardware companies are cyclical, one-trick ponies forever dependent on making major technological breakthroughs. Computer memory manufacturers like Micron Technology and Seagate Technology Holdings come to mind. Aside from repeated swings from too much production to not enough, the introduction of NAND storage (you typically call them flash drives) set the stage for a brutal competition between the two outfits; the RAM race has been just as difficult.
Not every technology name is subject to the economy's or the sector's cyclical effects, though, nor highly dependent on one particular market. Among the best of the best of these types of tech companies you'll find Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), which has a hand in a semi-cyclical, high-growth arena as well as in a slower-growth, less-cyclical segment of the graphics processing unit (GPU) market.
Not one, but two big breadwinners
It's a multifaceted company, and yet it's also a highly focused one that can repurpose its very best intellectual property in a lot of different ways. Its different operating segments serve the video gaming market, connected automobiles, computer-based creators and designers in need of powerful visualization solutions, and enterprises operating data centers. It also licenses technology and outright sells GPUs to computer and laptop manufacturers looking to meet consumer demand for high-powered electronics.
There's little doubt as to Nvidia's two biggest and best breadwinners, though. Of last quarter's $6.5 billion in revenue, nearly $3.1 billion of it came from the video gaming market, while almost $2.4 billion worth of hardware was sold to organizations looking to build or upgrade data centers. The former source's sales improved 85% year over year and 11% from first-quarter levels, while the latter saw year-over-year growth of 35% and improved 16% from the first quarter's data center tally. Both extend streaks that took hold in late 2019 (fiscal 2020) and plowed right through the headwinds spurred by the pandemic.
Data source: Nvidia. Chart by author.
Don't look past the healthy balance of Nvidia's revenue mix. The organization has two divisions it can lean on, in good times and bad. The same can't be said of all companies.
Perhaps more important, however, don't look past the differing nature of Nvidia's two biggest business lines.
The best of both worlds
The gaming market is clearly the bigger and higher-growth opportunity, but let's face it: Video gamers can be a fickle bunch. It took 2019's launch of its new GeForce RTX graphics cards to really excite these consumers, and the 2020 debut of second-generation cards based on its Ampere architecture to rekindle that excitement. Coronavirus shutdowns, of course, helped spur that interest.
At the time, the underlying technology could legitimately be considered game-changing for the gaming world. It will take some time for the company to come up with another technological evolution, and gamers are apt to simply stick with their graphics cards until then. That should cool off sales growth from its current clip.
Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) is also finally getting serious about gaming GPUs, unveiling its so-called Alchemist micro-architecture graphics cards last week for launch sometime in 2022. That will at least make a small dent in Nvidia's gaming card business. For the time being, though, what a growth engine!

At the other end of the excitement spectrum you'll find Nvidia's data center business. This arm is still ultimately built around graphics processing (the A100 design in particular), but the tech is tweaked for uses that big businesses would care about. This technology is particularly well suited for artificial intelligence applications and supercomputing.
It's boring stuff. It's also not a high-octane growth arena. Information-technology market researcher Gartner believes the data-center infrastructure market will only grow about 6% this year, and that's after a COVID-crimped 2020. Gartner expects data-center spending growth to cool to a pace of only 3.4% next year.
The market is expected to keep growing at a snail's pace at least through 2024, however, and Nvidia is positioned to plug into more than its fair share of that. Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya estimates the company's data center revenue could grow at an annualized clip of 30% or more for several years.
The bottom line
It's still a technology stock, to be clear. Even though its businesses are relatively well shielded from cyclical headwinds, sometimes tech stocks as a group fall out of favor. It would also be naive to presume that Nvidia can't falter on research and development or supply planning. It's a for-profit technology player, which imposes at least some degree of risk that's currently bolstered by the fact that shares are up more than 50% just since mid-May.
By most technology stock standards, though, this is a well-balanced one in terms of risk, reward, reliability, and predictability. And a decent pullback is (still) an entry opportunity for long-term investors.

Aug 24 (Reuters) - An Arizona economic development group on Tuesday said it had made a deal with Taiwanese economic development officials aimed at making the U.S. state more attractive to Taiwan's semiconductor industry as the world's biggest chipmaker eyes a $12 billion plant in Phoenix.
The Taiwan-USA Industrial Cooperation Promotion Office, which is supported by Taiwan's Ministry of Economic Affairs, signed an agreement with economic development officials in the greater Phoenix area to find ways to bring more of Taiwan's vast semiconductor industry to the metro area.
The move comes as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co 2330.TW, the world's largest chip company and a maker of semiconductors for Apple Inc AAPL.O and many others, has said it wants to build a plant in Phoenix.
The Phoenix city council gave city officials the go-ahead to negotiate with the chipmaker in November, but the details of the deal - including any potential tax breaks - have not been released. Reuters reported in May the TSMC might build as many as six plants in the area, some of which could use its most advanced technology.
The Phoenix area is already home to a major Intel Corp INTC.O chip factory, and NXP Semiconductors NXPI.O and ON Semiconductor Corp ON.O also have factories and offices there.
Chris Camacho, chief executive of the Greater Phoenix Economic Council that signed the agreement Tuesday, said his group is working to co-locate as many TSMC suppliers and other associated companies to the area as possible. He said about 40 companies are currently evaluating Arizona for possible investment, but declined to name them due to confidentiality agreements.
Camacho said his group is working with schools and local governments in the region to try to ease the relocation process for Taiwanese families who move to the area.
""We're unapologetically pursuing becoming the top global destination for semiconductors and the semiconductor supply chain,"" he said in an interview.

2021-08-23 00:00:00+00:00,4 Top Tech Stocks To Watch In The Stock Market This Week,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/4-top-tech-stocks-to-watch-in-the-stock-market-this-week-2021-08-23,,,"Are These The Best Tech Stocks To Buy This Week?
When looking at the broader stock market, tech stocks are among the most exciting stocks to invest in. For one, they are also some of the most relatable stocks as we utilize technology in our daily lives. Some say that the sky’s the limit when it comes to technology. Well, we may have gone well beyond that as commercial space travel could be a thing in the near future. This year, we saw Richard Branson of Virgin Galactic Holdings (NYSE: SPCE) and Amazon.com’s(NASDAQ: AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos visiting space as tourists. 
Would space travel be possible without the technological advancement over the past few decades? Probably not. Now, I think we can agree that most industries today are dependent on technology. In fact, it would be reasonable to believe that any significant advancement in many industries would leverage some form of technology. With all these in mind, let’s take a look at some of the top tech stocks in thestock market today
Best Tech Stocks To Watch This Week
Paypal Holdings Inc (NASDAQ: PYPL)
Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC)
Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA)
NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA)
Paypal 
First, we will be looking at the technology platform and digital payments company, Paypal. Essentially, the company’s tech platform allows consumers and merchants to make digital payments. Some of the notable payment solutions from the company would be Venmo, Xoom, PayPal, Braintree, and iZettle. PYPL stock has risen over 35% over the past year. 
Starting this week, its customers in the UK will be able to buy, hold, and sell cryptocurrency through PayPal. Customers can choose from four types of cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin, Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash, and Ethereum. Furthermore, they can view real-time crypto prices, access educational content, and learn more about cryptocurrencies through their PayPal account. With this, it would help people in the UK explore cryptocurrencies and expand the reach of the company. 
Furthermore, the company announced that it will no longer charge late fees for missed payments on its buy now, pay later (BNPL) service globally. Eliminating late fees builds on PayPal’s commitment to delivering the most customer-centric, global installment solution portfolio that helps meet the needs of today’s consumers and merchants. The company has seen incredible response and adoption of flexible payment options. Given all these exciting developments, would PYPL stock be on the top of your watchlist?

Best Lithium Battery Stocks To Buy Now? 4 To Know
Intel 
Following that, we have the global tech giant, Intel. For those unfamiliar, Intel is a company that engages in designing and manufacturing products and technologies. The company’s processor chips are vital components in countless laptops and desktops in use today. With the resurgence in Delta variant cases globally, the company’s products and services could see a rise in demand yet again. 
Earlier this month, SADA, a global business and tech consultancy, announced a pilot cloud optimization program along with Intel. Now, the program includes more than a dozen companies that include some of SADA’s largest customers. The program is intended to ensure its customer’s Google Cloud Platform environments are performing as efficiently as possible. In this day and age, the ability to adapt and quickly overcome disruption while maintaining continuous operations has become the new normal. 
On top of that, the company continues to post strong financial updates throughout the semiconductor shortage crisis. For its second quarter, Intel posted revenue of $19.63 billion on earnings per share of $1.24, exceeding its second-quarter guidance. Out of which, the company saw record revenue in its PC and Mobileye divisions. From this, we can see that customers continue to choose Intel for its products despite the high competition. All things considered, would you invest in INTC stock?

Tesla 
Next, we have the poster child of the electric vehicles (EV) industry, Tesla. The company strives to transition the world to sustainable energy with electric cars, solar, and integrated energy solutions. Not to mention, it is also one of the leaders in the autonomous driving space through its Full Self-Driving technology.  
Last week, the company’s CEO Elon Musk got everyone talking about the company again after the announcement regarding the launch of its  “Tesla Bot” prototype next year. It appears that this robot is designed for dangerous, repetitive, or boring work that people may not like to do. For example, it should be able to handle jobs from attaching bolts to cars with a wrench or picking up groceries at stores. So, the plan now is that the robot will utilize the same artificial intelligence that the company uses for its vehicles.
Well, these may be exciting technological milestones but the company remains cautious as it moves forward with the humanoid robot design. Elon Musk claims that the robot is “intended to be friendly and navigate through a world built for humans”. Hence, it will be built at a “mechanical level” where someone could “run away from it, and most likely overpower it”. With the addition of this, we can see that Tesla continues to leverage its leadership position in the tech world to push the technological boundaries today. Now, would you consider adding TSLA stock to your watchlist today?

NVIDIA 
To sum up this list, we have the AI company that has revolutionized the industry, Nvidia. For those unfamiliar, the company is known for being the pioneer in graphics processing units (GPU) for the gaming and professional markets. Also, it offers solutions to accelerate the entirety of the end-to-end analytics workflow.  From machine learning to deep AI learning, the company’s software allows customers to get higher accuracy results and quicker reporting. NVDA stock has risen over 55% since the start of the year.
The company’s stock bullish run for the year is backed by its strong fundamentals. Last Thursday, the company announced its second-quarter earnings report. It posted revenue of $6.51 billion, up by 68% year-over-year. Out of which, gaming revenue was $3.06 billion, up by a whopping 85% year-over-year. What’s more impressive is that its GAAP earnings per diluted share for the quarter was $0.94, representing an increase of a staggering 276% from a year ago and 24% from the previous quarter. 
We also saw the company launch its NVIDIA Omniverse during the quarter. This is the world’s first simulation and collaboration platform that runs physically realistic virtual worlds and connects to other digital platforms. In the Omniverse, artists can create one-of-a-kind digital scenes, and engineers can design new products for homes. These creations can then be taken into the physical world after they have been perfected in the digital world. Safe to say, these are exciting times for the company. So, would you consider NVDA stock as a top tech stock to watch right now?

2021-08-23 00:00:00+00:00,3 Nasdaq 100 Stocks That Are Best Buys Now,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-nasdaq-100-stocks-that-are-best-buys-now-2021-08-23,,,"Over the past five years, the Nasdaq 100 has outperformed the S&P 500 by better than 2-to-1, returning 214% to the S&P 500's 103% through Aug. 19, 2021. It's not surprising, really, since the Nasdaq index consists of the 100 largest non-financial stocks on the exchange. Look back 10 years and you'll see the same disparity in performance.
While that's helpful in understanding where investors should have looked for winning stocks back then, you want to know which stocks to buy today, ones that will help make the Nasdaq 100 a winning investment over the next five or 10 years. The following three stocks ought to provide such market-beating results.

Broadcom
If Broadcom's (NASDAQ: AVGO) performance in 2021 looks unremarkable, you're not wrong -- the stock trades almost exactly where it did six months ago. Yet despite the maturity of the chip industry and the shortages it currently faces, Broadcom is still a growing company and will continue to be one well into the future.
That's because technology is constantly changing and advancing, so as long as Broadcom continues to evolve with it (and so far it has been able to do so relatively seamlessly), it has exceptional room for future growth.
Apple is Broadcom's biggest customer, accounting for 15% of revenue, but that's down from 20% the year before as Broadcom added more customers to its roster. Its top five customers represent 30% of total sales, and while such concentration does introduce risk should they take their business elsewhere, Broadcom is also diversified across industries such as finance, insurance, transportation, and other sectors.
Still, the primary growth catalyst for the chipmaker over the coming years remains the 5G network rollout and the booming demand for 5G smartphones. Its growing data center business, for which it supplies switching, routing, processors, controllers, and more, also offers significant opportunity.
With a dividend that yields a healthy 3% annually, investors will be rewarded with both capital appreciation on the stock and a payout to enhance the returns.

Fiserv
Payments and financial services technology provider Fiserv (NASDAQ: FISV) has a three-pronged approach to facilitating cashless transactions that ought to benefit from the post-pandemic economic recovery.
It offers businesses of any size the opportunity to meet their customers however they shop. Its Carat technology lets large merchants adopt an omnichannel approach to commerce while the Clover platform was built for small- and medium-sized companies to accept and process payments whether in store or online.
Fiserv also offers digital payments processing, fraud protection, and credit and debit cards to financial institutions, while also allowing them to manage customer deposit and loan accounts. It also provides them with financial and risk management services.
The growth in cryptocurrencies also presents a unique opportunity for Fiserv. Over the past year it moved $4 billion worth of payments volume in and out of crypto wallets, but moved $2 billion in the second quarter alone, indicating the swift increase cryptocurrencies are experiencing.
Recessions can wreak havoc on a financial services company like Fiserv, as last year showed. The decline in global economic activity resulted in a significant decrease in payment volumes and transactions, so there will be periods when its business slumps. The benefit for investors is that economy-expanding bull markets tend to last a lot longer than bear markets, and as demand for digital financial services increases, Fiserv should see its own business ramp up for years to come.

Intel
Last year Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) was rattled by Apple moving away from its chips to those of its own design and by Microsoft also saying it was developing its own chips for data centers. The current chip shortage is doing it no favors either, but it's intent upon regaining its footing.
Despite the hiccups, Intel remains the biggest semiconductor vendor by revenue with a 15.6% share of the market, comfortably ahead of second place Samsung with a 12.5% share. It was also able to grow throughout the pandemic with revenue expanding 8% to $78 billion in 2020, its fifth consecutive year of record revenue, indicating it remains a highly recession-resistant business. It also has plenty of levers to pull for future growth, too.
As more businesses move to the cloud, they will need solutions that allow them to store and process ever larger amounts of data. New management at Intel is intent on ensuring the chip maker is at the forefront of the industry, announcing earlier this year it would be investing $3.5 billion to expand its manufacturing capabilities, focused particularly upon its 3D packaging technology. That will allow Intel to stack chips vertically rather than side by side, increasing computing power in a smaller footprint.
At just 12 times trailing and estimated earnings, Intel is offering investors a chance to get in relatively cheap on this tech giant that has the potential to disrupt expectations.

2021-08-23 00:00:00+00:00,Synopsys design software uses AI to make chips more power efficient,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/synopsys-design-software-uses-ai-to-make-chips-more-power-efficient-2021-08-23,,,"By Stephen Nellis
Aug 23 (Reuters) - Synopsys Inc SNPS.O said on Monday one of its customers used artificial intelligence software to get a 26% gain in the power efficiency of a computer chip, a leap that usually has to wait for a new generation of chip manufacturing technology.
Modern computing chips are made of billions of transistors and wires laid down on a piece of silicon the size of a fingernail. Precisely how all the elements are placed on the chip, along with other design and architecture choices, has a major impact on how well they perform and how much they cost to make.
Major chip firms like Intel Corp QCOM.O or Nvidia Corp NVDA.O can spend two years and hundreds of millions of dollars to perfect their designs. Synopsys is one of the major makers of software used to do that work.
The company has started weaving artificial intelligence called DSO.ai into its flagship chip design suite to help chip designers get better results, faster, while trying to balance trade-offs on speed, power efficiency and cost to meet their business goals. Samsung Electronics Co Ltd 005930.KS and Renesas Electronics Corp 6723.T have begun using it, with Samsung last year saying it had cut a chip design step that would have taken months down to weeks.
On Monday, Synopsys said the AI system can now take into account what software will eventually run on a chip to squeeze out more gains. A major cloud computing provider that it did not name got a 26% gain in power efficiency versus the best solution found by human designers.
In the past, gains like those came from a new generation of chip manufacturing technology that would come every two years rather than purely from the design. The new software can squeeze much more out of existing chip factories, said Aart de Geus, chief executive of Synopsys.
""It is significant because design is now actually more of the enabler than ever before,"" de Geus told Reuters in an interview.

2021-08-22 00:00:00+00:00,Why Nvidia Won't Be Taken Down With Crypto's Dive,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-nvidia-wont-be-taken-down-with-cryptos-dive-2021-08-22,,,"Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) just hit another earnings report out of the park. Second-quarter fiscal 2022 revenue handily topped management's own forecast and was up 68% year over year. The party should continue into Q3 -- Nvidia expects a 44% year-over-year increase in sales at the midpoint of guidance. That's especially impressive considering sales were up 57% during the third quarter of last year. As expected, video game and data center revenue is leading the charge.
Some investors had been worried the drubbing cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) and Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) took this past spring would upend Nvidia's progress, but that didn't happen. This is not the 2018 Nvidia that suffered when cryptocurrencies took a plunge. A sudden slump in sales of chips to crypto miners this year is not going to take the company down. There are two primary reasons why.
Image source: Getty Images
Nvidia made product changes addressing cryptocurrencies
Early in 2021, Nvidia took some steps to address a ""problem"" years in the making: Graphics processing units (GPUs) are coveted not just by gamers, but also by crypto miners (mining is the process by which cryptocurrencies are created and managed). To ensure its new GPUs designed specifically with high-end video games in mind ended up in the hands of actual gamers, Nvidia started embedding an algorithm that cuts the hash rate (a unit of measure for the calculations performed during mining) when it detects crypto mining.
Concurrently with that change, Nvidia also released its CMP line of chips designed specifically for mining. This product adjustment would help with supply constraints of its top-of-the-line GPUs for video games, and it would help both gamers and miners get the hardware they desired. During the Q1earnings callthis past spring, CFO Colette Kress had said to expect a whopping $400 million in CMP sales alone. For context, gaming-specific sales were $2.76 billion in the first quarter, but it remained unclear how much of that was due to miners scooping up GPUs.
While the product lineup adjustments were a great move, Nvidia just said on the latestearnings callit's still unclear just how much of its video game segment revenue came from mining. But one thing is certain: The most recent cryptocurrency sell-off this past spring didn't put much of a dent in gaming momentum. Gaming revenue was $3.06 billion in Q2. Adding to the evidence that the lion's share of these GPUs are in fact going to gamers, Kress said CMP sales were only $266 million in the second quarter, far below its expectation for $400 million. Additionally, Kress said to expect ""a minimal contribution from CMP going forward."" In other words, even though mining is on the wane right now, the gaming segment still notched an 11% sequential gain in Q2 and is expected to grow again in the third quarter.
Clearly, mining profitability has taken a hit since cryptos have fallen from all-time highs earlier this year, and that is impacting parts of Nvidia's business. However, it isn't slowing down the company that much as a world's worth of gamers updates their rigs with new GPUs. Kress said the number of global esports participants is fast approaching half a billion people. Video games are big business these days, and Nvidia has a commanding lead on this front. A temporary slowdown in cryptocurrency mining isn't going to change that.
The data center business is far larger than it was in 2018
Crypto miners aren't the only non-gaming end market demanding GPUs. Data centers -- the computing units that form the backbone of cloud computing -- are also ramping up their use of GPUs, putting them to work as computing accelerators to handle complex workloads and applications like artificial intelligence (AI).
Nvidia has had a flurry of innovation on this front in recent years, unleashing a slew of new chips designed for these data center customers. It also made the acquisition of networking hardware company Mellanox early last year to bolster this emerging area of expertise. As a result, the data center segment hauled in $2.37 billion in sales in Q2 and has been steadily catching up to the gaming unit in size.
For comparison, when the crypto crash of 2018 sent Nvidia sliding backwards (during Nvidia's fiscal 2019), data centers represented only about one-quarter of total revenue. They now account for more than one-third of the total.
Nvidia is only just getting started on this front, too. Some of its more recent hardware announcements for data centers haven't even begun to be commercialized yet (like its Grace central processing units that integrate directly with its GPUs). This is a huge segment of the semiconductor industry that has long been dominated by Intel. Tens of billions in annual sales are up for grabs if Nvidia's innovations can continue to steadily garner momentum.
Long story short, Nvidia's data center segment is a much larger part of its business than it was a few years ago, and it's picking up steam -- especially as it starts to add cloud computing software services into the mix as well. Fears that the crypto market downturn from this past spring would decimate Nvidia again were overblown. Granted, another uptick in crypto activity would help, but it isn't a primary catalyst for this chip designer. This is the best long-term semiconductor investment around, as it benefits from multiple secular growth trends in the global economy.

2021-08-20 00:00:00+00:00,Nvidia vs. AMD -- the New Oil? Which Stock Should You Buy?,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/nvidia-vs.-amd-the-new-oil-which-stock-should-you-buy-2021-08-20,,,"Is data the new oil? I have been saying for over a year that it is not. Data needs data centers, and data centers need semiconductors. Therefore, semiconductors are the new oil. Think about it for a minute. Consider all the secular growth trends and disruptive innovations we are experiencing and will continue to experience over the next decade. Here are several to consider:
Data centers
Cloud computing
Cybersecurity
Space exploration
Video gaming
Online gambling
Augmented reality (AR)
Virtual reality (VR)
Mixed reality (MR)
Autonomous driving
Electric vehicles
Genomics
Esports
5G
E-commerce
Cryptocurrency
Artificial intelligence (AI)
Metaverse
Big Data
What do all these growth trends have in common? They all require semiconductors. So which stocks are the best to own? You could leverage an ETF like VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SMH) or iShares Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SOXX), but which companies could help capture the most gains in these disruptive technologies? Perhaps an excellent pick-and-shovel stock exists. Today, I do deep-dive analysis on Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD). I will explain the growth trends that both companies help fuel, and I'll provide opinions on which stock is the best long-term investment.
Nvidia reported impressive earnings after the closing bell on Wednesday, and it's evident that the company is firing on all cylinders. Nvidia got its big break in 2001, winning the Xbox award and becoming the fastest semiconductor company in history to reach $1 billion in sales. It was co-founded in 1993 by the current CEO, Jen-Hsun ""Jensen"" Huang. Huang is one of the most influential leaders in Silicon Valley, and his capabilities seem to age like fine wine. People want to work for Nvidia, and the company's list of credentials grows annually. To provide insight into how impressive Nvidia's business is, here is a list of recognitions:
Harvard Business Review's CEO 100
Fortune's Best Places to Work
MIT Tech Review's 50 Smartest Companies
Fortune's World's Most Admired Companies
Forbes JUST 100 Best Corporate Citizens
Dow Jones Sustainability Index
What's mind-blowing to many is that Huang is actually related to AMD's CEO, Lisa Su. That's right, Su's grandfather is Huang's uncle. Talk about brainpower running in the family! AMD has a much longer history than Nvidia. In fact, it was founded in 1969, and among its eight founders was Walter Jeremiah (Jerry) Sanders, a former executive at Fairchild Semiconductor Corporation. AMD's first product dates all the way back to 1970, but it did not begin producing computer chips until several years later. AMD struggled for many years to compete against behemoth Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), although the tides have recently turned. Intel is a company that arguably failed to innovate, and Su and her team at AMD were able to capitalize on its complacency. In 2016 AMD released Ryzen, which is known as a Zen microprocessor. Speeds blew past Intel's by 50% or more in some areas, which changed the game for AMD.
Both Nvidia and AMD have been making strong pushes into data center processors. Their compound annual growth rates have been impressive, and in my opinion data centers are the largest potential growth drivers for both companies. Nvidia is in the process of acquiring ARM Holdings from SoftBank (OTC: SFTB.Y) for approximately $40 billion, which would be a game changer in its data center segment. The acquisition is currently held up in the approval process, but Nvidia told investors on their recentearnings callthat the deal should get done. A denial is certainly a risk for the Nvidia's stock price, so it's something to be aware of. AMD is following the same approach by acquiring Xilinx (NASDAQ: XLNX), which is expected to close by the end of 2021 for a similar price tag of approximately $36 billion. Of course, both Arm and Xilinx do more than just data center hardware. For example, Xilinx is a leading designer of field programmable gate arrays, and the acquisition would help AMD combat its archrival, Intel, in this area.
Each acquisition would be huge for its respective company, but should you buy AMD or Nvidia stock? Please watch the below video for additional deep-dive stock analysis and opinions on the semiconductor industry and specifically Nvidia and AMD.

2021-08-20 00:00:00+00:00,Will Intel Be a Trillion-Dollar Stock by 2030?,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/will-intel-be-a-trillion-dollar-stock-by-2030-2021-08-20,,,"Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) has not shown any signs in recent years that it is on its way to a $1 trillion market capitalization. Stagnant revenue from year to year and a lost technical lead left this tech giant far behind peers of the PC era, such as Microsoft, Nvidia, and even Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD).
CEO Pat Gelsinger has instituted changes that could address technical challenges and spawn new lines of business. Nonetheless, Intel will have to show that these changes can return the company to growth before it can consider a future where its market cap exceeds $1 trillion.
Image source: Getty Images.
The $1 trillion market cap is reachable, but obstacles remain
Interestingly, a $1 trillion market cap for Intel within nine years is not as far-fetched as one might assume. Its current market cap of $220 billion means that it needs to produce approximately 18% stock price growth per year to make it to that milestone by 2030.
Moreover, Intel currently sells for 12 times earnings. According to CSIMarket, the current P/E ratio of the semiconductor industry stands at above 20. This means that matching that multiple takes the market cap to about $370 billion. However, that multiple lags the P/E ratio of key peers. If Intel matched AMD's multiple of 38, that by itself takes its market cap to around $700 billion. Nonetheless, other than a brief time after the financial crisis, Intel has not consistently sustained a P/E ratio above 35 since the early 2000s.
Stagnant revenue has likely influenced this low multiple. Indeed, Intel still generated five times as much revenue as AMD in the first six months of 2021. However, during the same period in 2020, Intel produced 10 times as much revenue as its rival. Also, other than a brief sales surge during the pandemic, it has struggled to drive meaningful revenue growth for years.
Moreover, the company has also struggled since its development pace slowed in the early 2010s. This allowed longtime rival AMD to capture a technical lead under CEO Lisa Su's leadership.
Intel has made technical strides recently and now produces more 10-nanometer than 14-nanometer chips. Still, Intel has stated that it will not release its own 7-nanometer Meteor Lake chip until 2023, a massive lag considering that AMD has sold 7-nanometer processors since 2019.
Business lines that could take it to $1 trillion
Despite such challenges, $1 trillion might still be reachable if Gelsinger can institute his changes successfully. At the Intel Accelerated event on July 26, Gelsinger outlined a plan that could spell trouble for Intel's peers. He stated a goal to catch Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) and Samsung technologically by 2024 and retake the technical lead by 2025.
Additionally, TSMC's success is one reason Taiwan controls two-thirds of the world's chip manufacturing, according to TrendForce. This fact alarmed many politicians in Washington, and the U.S. Senate has subsequently passed a bill that included $39 billion in subsidies to build new fabs, funding Gelsinger has openly sought. In a world of chip shortages and limited capacity, such a move could potentially boost Intel's market share.
Gelsinger has also worked to revive Intel's foundries independent of subsidies, investing $20 billion in its Arizona facility and $3.5 billion in its New Mexico site. These investments also mean that Intel will build chips for other clients, a business similar to that of TSMC called Intel Foundry Services. Intel Foundry Services also announced that it recruited Amazon's AWS as its first client.
Furthermore, Intel may have made the move that could stop its more technologically advanced peers in their tracks. Chinese media outlet UDN reported that Intel bought TSMC's remaining 3-nanometer chip production capacity. While Intel will devote this capacity to GPUs and server chips instead of consumer market CPUs, it could hamper the ability of AMD and Apple to increase capacity, as neither company currently operates fabs of its own.
Is $1 trillion by 2030 possible?
Intel's lost technical lead and flat revenue growth left it with a low multiple and a market cap far below $1 trillion. However, increased foundry capacity, an initiative to catch up to peers technologically, and significant control over 3-nanometer chip production could bode well for Intel over the next few years. Such competitive moves do not guarantee the needed 18%-plus annual stock price increases. Nonetheless, if these businesses help Intel boost earnings and by extension boost its P/E ratio, a $1 trillion market cap by 2030 for this chip stock is a reachable goal.

This video was recorded on Aug. 9, 2021.
Chris Hill: It's Monday, Aug. 9th. Welcome to MarketFoolery. I'm Chris Hill, with me today, Jason Moser. Jason, how are you?
Jason Moser: Happy Monday. I'm well. How are you?
Hill: I'm feeling all right. We've got Berkshire Hathaway's latest results. We're going to talk small-cap tech, but we will begin with digital ads. The Trade Desk's second-quarter revenue was double what it was a year ago. It was double, and their guidance was good. Despite that, shares of The Trade Desk were down a little bit this morning. Although, I will point out that it's bounced back up from where it was at the open, which anytime I see that the immediate reaction, the pre-market activity, is worse than what it ends up being during the day. It makes me wonder if at first blush, maybe this wasn't what Wall Street was looking for and then they dig in a little deeper and they're like, ""Oh, this was pretty good.""
Moser: That's the trick with pre-market and aftermarket, depending on when the company announced this. Obviously, there are always going to be knee-jerk reactions. Reactions from investors just that are operating on a different timeline, I mean, obviously, a lot of the money that's controlled out there these days are running on a very much shorter timeline than we tend to operate on. You try to look past that, and I've always said, I focus more on making sure that management is doing what they say they're going to do in hitting the targets that they said. To me, that's far more important than the arbitrary numbers that you get from the street, so to speak. It's not to say those are irrelevant, but they're just based on a much shorter timeline. They typically don't tell the whole story. I think with The Trade Desk, it is a business that has just not only set itself up for success, it's also a business in transition, and we'll talk about that in a minute. I think when you look at the numbers, the numbers were terrific. They exceeded the guidance that management set out a quarter ago. Revenue more than doubled from a year ago to $280 million for the quarter and earnings per share followed suit. Customer retention remained very strong, over 95% for the quarter the way it has for the previous seven years, I think, I mean, these companies just for the longest time, just done so well retaining their business and growing relationships with their customers.
The investments that they're making in the universal ID 2.0, that's this alternative to third-party cookies. They launched their Solimar platform, which is ultimately, it's just another way for advertisers to on board to get that first-party data that's so important to them. Better measurement, better goal setting. This is just a business that continues to reinvest in itself. Given the profitability of the business already, the cash flow nature of the business already. I mean, it makes a lot of money. The valuation has always been seemingly a little bit stretched, but I think it's been stretched for really good reasons. I mean, you've got a company that is keying in on a big market opportunity with good financials and continuing to iterate and evolve and bring new tools to its biggest advertising partners. I think that market reaction today notwithstanding, investors in The Trade Desk, and I'm one, you got to feel really good about what this business is doing.
Hill: In terms of the business of The Trade Desk transitioning, what should people be watching for? There are a lot of businesses and a lot of industries that are trying to either expand what they're doing, increase their optionality. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. What are you going to be watching with The Trade Desk?
Moser: I think it will be a couple of things in particular, No. 1, management, every quarter really they continue to hammer home this idea that the advertising-supported video on demand market is going to outpace the growth of subscription video on demand over the coming years. That is the basis of this business. I mean, advertising-supported video on demand, that's what they do. It's very easy for us in our domestic box here to view subscriptions as superior because you're able to avoid ads for the most part. When you look at it from a global perspective though, it's far different. There are a lot of economies out there, a lot of consumers that are far more economically sensitive than perhaps we are here. Advertising video on demand is certainly a more attractive value proposition in many cases. I think, also, a lot of the services that we're seeing rolled out here, even domestically, or incorporating advertising level tiers.
To me, we want to continue to see that advertising video on demand growth continuing. We'll see that continue to outpace the subscription. Then also just the buy-in in regard to this UID 2.0, this universal ID. The more partners, the more customers that buy into this idea, that see the value in this concept, I think the more that really validates the work that The Trade Desk is doing. To that point, they noted that a few more partners really bought in over this past quarter. I mean, Omnicom Group wants AMC Networks to load in. Even with that Snowflake Data Cloud. You've got companies buying into this notion that UID 2.0 is a good alternative to those third-party cookies and the more buy-in you see there, then that just creates a little bit of a flywheel, and we love to see those flywheels. Those are a couple of things, I think, worth keeping an eye on.
Hill: Let's move on to CEVA. Shares of CEVA were down 4%, 5% this morning. We talked about this company back in February. It's a small tech company, with a market cap of around $1 billion. They own a portfolio of intellectual property serving the semiconductor industry. How did the second quarter look to you?
Moser: The second quarter looks great. I mean, this is a neat little business. When I say little, I mean, you hit the nail on the head there. Just breaking through $100 million in annual revenue here recently. CEVA operates a licensing and royalty business model and they ultimately are getting technology into the silicon that gets out there into all sorts of different devices and applications like AR, VR, and artificial intelligence, and 5G, Internet of Things, robotics. I mean, CEVA has a wide reach there. Then when you talk about our customer base and, say, very large and broad one, everyone from Broadcom and Cirrus Logic to Intel, iRobot, Nokia, Samsung, Sony. You're going to find that CEVA owns a lot of the technology that you use on any given day. Again, a company where management set expectations and then exceeded those expectations, revenue for the quarter of $30.5 million was up 29% from a year ago.
Now, if you back out a royalty payment that they've received, it was a one-time royalty payment. Ultimately, the resolution of a dispute. That growth was only 16.5%, but it was still royalty revenue. It was revenue they were going to get one way or the other. That's more of a timing thing than anything else. They see all-time record high shipments of Bluetooth technology, Wi-Fi, and cellular IoT devices. Then we also saw some new licensing agreements for the quarter. They signed 17 licensing agreements. Six of those were with first-time customers and geographically nicely diversified as well. Over the quarter, they made an acquisition of a little company called Intrinsics, and that's going to give CEVA more exposure to the aerospace and defense, and space markets. Those are obviously very big and fairly reliable markets, so that's encouraging as well. All things considered, the big-picture thesis on a business like this is if you believe in this concept of connectivity, if you think that we're becoming more tech-enabled and connectivity is only becoming more and more ubiquitous, then CEVA is a company that should benefit from those tailwinds and it continues to look like they do benefit from these tailwinds. It's one I've enjoyed following. It's very small, obviously. It is one that's going to be a little bit more volatile. Trading volumes are much lower, so you see some bigger price wings. It's one that I continue to say you need patience with a business like this.
This is one of those types of companies where you buy it and you own it, you plan on holding this thing for the next 10 years maybe. I know that sounds like a long time, but that frankly is how you need to look at a business like this because we're looking at ultimately a business that should remain very relevant even as we move beyond 5G into 6G, 7G, and so forth. I mean, CEVA is going to own this technology that should remain relevant for a long time to come and those licensing and royalty business models, they produce some really healthy margins. That's a 90% gross margin business. You don't see those often and so when you find them, you need to at least take note.
Hill: How confident are you that in 10 years it's going to still be a stand-alone company? Because it's small enough and they're doing enough interesting things that one of my thoughts, looking at CEVA is, boy, someone with deep pockets has to be looking at this business.
Moser: I feel like you're right and given the size, it would amount to a bolt-on acquisition for a lot of bigger players out there in the tech space. It wouldn't take anything just to buy this company up and add it to your portfolio. I didn't make the recommendation based on that, but when I was doing the research for this business, that was one thing that kept on coming back to my mind. I was like, it really feels like given the technology that they own, given the numbers that they continue to report, and given how many devices this company is in — given this company's technologies is in, it's difficult for me to imagine in 10 years that it wouldn't be snapped up. But stranger things have certainly happened.
Hill: Speaking of deep pockets, Berkshire Hathaway's second-quarter profits were 7% higher than a year ago. We can talk about the reopening boosting Berkshire's railroad and energy businesses. But this really seems increasingly like a share buyback story. Buffett and Munger are sticking to their guns in terms of not overpaying for acquisitions, their cash pile is only getting larger even with the share buybacks. I think it's $140 billion now. Look, I'm not — if you're a shareholder. The stock's up 23% this year. It's not exciting, but a stock going north is.
Moser: True. Yeah, stock going up is an interesting and noteworthy stock. That's one that makes you smile. I think that with Berkshire Hathaway, we're getting what we more or less expect I think with a business like this at this point in its life. Not lighting the world on fire, but still doing well. You look at the last three and five years, I believe it's underperformed the market a little bit, but you stretch that timeline further out and it starts to look better and that's the idea behind this business. You look at a business like this and you own it for a long time and you never really worry about it. This quarter, I think, really explains why. You saw a nice bounce back from what was a difficult year last year. Operating earnings are up 21% from a year ago, because of what you noted, their performance in energy railroads. Obviously, insurance is going to be a little bit more reliable. But yeah, it does feel like this is a story where the conversation is going to become more and more about, how do we return value to shareholders? I know there were a lot of folks out there who would love to see Berkshire start paying a dividend. I feel like that would make sense at this point for them.
I'm not a shareholder of Berkshire Hathaway, but it feels like they could do that and it would probably make a lot of investors feel pretty good, because they are repurchasing a ton of stock. To your point there, they repurchased $6 billion in stock during the quarter. I think that brings the six-month total to better than $12 billion, basically on track for what they did last year. Yeah, they're not going to go out there and overpay for anything, and it's a market where valuations are stretched really in a lot of ways. It feels like they just believe that Berkshire Hathaway today represents a better value than most of what's out there. I can respect that. Whether you agree with it or not, that's a different story entirely, but these guys are running the show and they have a pretty good idea of what the business is doing. I think they are very disciplined investors.
To me, I think the interesting question for Berkshire Hathaway really is what this company looks like in the future. At some point or another, it boils down to Greg Abel as the CEO, and Todd and Ted are leading the way with those investment portfolios. You have to feel like there is going to be a pivot maybe toward tech or toward more forward-looking ideas. Whether that happens or not, I guess remains to be seen. I feel like it has to at some point. What does this business look like then? Because if you have these cash-cow insurance businesses and you have some folks who feel more comfortable investing in tech. Munger and Buffett really, that's not really been their forte. They've been very clear about that. This could be a little bit of a different-looking investment portfolio here over the coming decade. It's a Berkshire Hathaway 2.0, so to speak, which could be exciting for investors, I think.
Hill: It could and I don't want to knock the underlying business. You look at the profits generated from operations. This quarter, it looked good. That's what's funding the share buybacks. They've done such a good job finding and acquiring all these businesses that generate cash. It's just that for about a year now this has been the dominant story with this stock. I'm sure if I were a shareholder, I'd be perfectly fine with this. But just as someone who is not a shareholder, I'm like, ""Really, you don't want to [laughs] spend any? You don't want to take $28 billion and go buy McCormick and get some spice in that?""
Moser: There's got to be some. CEVA, that's just like you dig underneath the couch cushions. Yeah, I don't know. You wonder what goes on behind closed doors. Allocating capital is difficult and the bigger you get, the more difficult it gets. Particularly, if you have such a long track record of success because expectations are even higher. People expect you to do something genius because you're Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger. Investing is as easy or difficult as you want to make it and it feels like right now they're just trying to keep things simple. They see the most value in their stock and their company. Again, we could argue whether that actually is the case or not, but it's in line, I think, with what they have historically done with the way that they've typically invested. It's not surprising to see. But yeah, again, I think it's going to be really neat to follow this story over the coming 10 years and beyond, just to see what this next iteration of Berkshire Hathaway is going to look like because it just feels like there's a ton of potential there.

2021-08-20 00:00:00+00:00,3 Top Stocks to Buy as the Semiconductor Shortage Continues,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-top-stocks-to-buy-as-the-semiconductor-shortage-continues-2021-08-20,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
A global shortage of semiconductors has turned the industry upside down. The demand for chips was high even before the pandemic started, due to the rollout of 5G.  However, the coronavirus pandemic drove that demand much higher as millions bought laptops, cell phones, and gaming devices as they sheltered in their homes. 
While many analysts thought the shortage would get better toward the end of the year as the vaccines rolled out, that may no longer be the case. Apple (NYSE:AAPL) CEO Tim Cook warned that silicon supply constraints would affect sales of the iPhone and iPad. This week Toyota Motor Corp. (NYSE:TM) announced it would reduce global production for September by 40% from its previous plan due to critical shortages of semiconductors.
Since the shortage reflects a tight supply, this has been a boon to the semiconductor industry and many chip stocks. With the shortage expected to continue, many chip stocks are ripe for continued gains. That’s why investors should consider chip stocks such as these, which are rated highly in our POWR Ratings system:
Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC)
Silicon Motion Technology Corp. (NASDAQ:SIMO)
Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)
Stocks to Buy: Intel Corporation (INTC)

Intel is the world’s largest chipmaker. It designs and manufactures microprocessors for the global personal computer and data center markets. While its server processor business has benefited from the shift to the cloud, the firm has also been expanding into new adjacencies as the personal computer market has stagnated.
This includes major trends such as the Internet of Things, artificial intelligence and automotive. The company has even made a string of acquisitions to build its artificial intelligence and automotive offerings, such as Altera, Mobileye, Habana Labs and Movidius. In fact, in the most recent quarter, both its Internet of Things and Mobileye reported extremely strong performance.
As the remote working wave doesn’t seem to have an end in sight, INTC should benefit from higher demand for its 10 nanometer SuperFin process-based 11th Gen core processors amid continued robust growth in the PC market. Plus, its data center business has a very bright future. As more information is increasingly stored in the cloud, there is demand for a new breed of chips like Intel provides.
The company has an overall grade of A, which translates into a “strong buy” rating in our POWR Ratings system. INTC has a Value Grade of A, which makes sense when considering its forward P/E of only 12.14. Its trailing P/E of 11.71 is even lower. The company also has a Quality Grade of B due to solid fundamentals.
For instance, it had $24.9 billion in cash as of the most recent quarter compared with only $3.7 billion in short-term debt. We also provide Growth, Momentum, Stability, and Sentiment grades for INTC, which you can find here. INTC is ranked No. 9 in the B-rated Semiconductor & Wireless Chip industry.

SIMO is a leading developer of microcontroller ICs for NAND flash storage devices. It focuses on the designing, developing, and marketing of controllers for managing NAND flash used in embedded storage applications, such as eMMC embedded memory. Its products are used in personal computing, smartphones and tablets, flash drives, and enterprise and data centers.
The company has been benefiting from strong demand for its solid-state drive (SSD) controllers and eMMC and UFS controllers. This led to an increase in both revenue and sales year over year in the most recent quarter. In fact, the company is a leading merchant supplier of client SSD controllers to module makers. Management believes the market will be dominated by SSDs that use TLC flash.
That should bolster their use in PCs, displacing mechanical hard disk drives. SSD offers higher performance and competitive advantage over HDDs, which is why PCs are increasingly adopting them. Plus, the company believes its SSD controller will be used for managing 3D flash from now on, and its eMMC controllers are also showing signs of a rebound. 
The company has an overall grade of A and a Strong Buy rating in our POWR Ratings system. SIMO has a Growth Grade of B, which isn’t surprising with its EBITDA up 26.7% over the past year. Its EBITDA is expected to surge 30% over the next year. Analysts expect earnings to soar 110.5% year over year in the current quarter.
The company also has a Sentiment Grade of A, indicating it is well-liked by Wall Street analysts, as four out of six analysts rate the stock a “buy.” Plus, based on an average of analyst price targets, the stock has an upside potential of 45%. For the rest of SIMO’s grades (Value, Momentum, Stability, and Quality), click here. SIMO is ranked No. 3 in the B-rated Semiconductor & Wireless Chip industry. 
Stocks to Buy: Broadcom Inc. (AVGO)

AVGO is the combined entity of Broadcom and Avago. Its Avago business is focused primarily on radio frequency filters and amplifiers used in high-end smartphones, such as the Apple iPhone and Samsung Galaxy devices. Its Legacy Broadcom business includes networking semiconductors, such as switch and physical layer chips, broadband products, and connectivity chips.
The company is benefiting from continued strength across both its semiconductor solutions and Infrastructure software verticals. For instance, the strong adoption of Wi-Fi 6 in access gateway and cable DOCSIS 3.1 products bode well for its long-term growth picture. Plus, the acceleration in 5G deployment and production ramp-up in radio frequency content also aids its future prospects.
In addition, the Internet of Things should create newer growth avenues for the company as it is widely believed to be the next growth opportunity in semiconductors. AVGO also continues to make acquisitions to expand the breadth and diversify its product portfolio. Management also provided upbeat guidance for the third quarter based on a strong uptick in broadband, networking, and wireless revenues.
AVGO has an overall grade of A, translating into a “strong buy” rating in our POWR Ratings system. The company has a Growth Grade of B as sales have grown an average of 18.5% per year over the past five years. Plus, analysts forecast earnings to rise 24.4% for the year. AVGO also has a Stability Grade of B as both its growth and price performance have been fairly consistent.
For instance, the stock has grown EBITDA an average of 41.9% per year over the past five years. To gains access to the rest of AVGO’s grades (Value, Momentum, Sentiment, and Quality), click here. AVGO is ranked No. 5 in the B-rated Semiconductor & Wireless Chip industry.

2021-08-19 00:00:00+00:00,New Products Apple Could Release This Fall,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/new-products-apple-could-release-this-fall-2021-08-19,,,"Apple finally appears poised to get back to a normal product launch schedule, with the company announcing a reveal event for 1 p.m. ET on Sept. 14. That means a host of new products – including the much-expected iPhone 13 – are likely to be announced in very short order.
This follows a turbulent past year or so that saw the technology giant weather multiple product setbacks amid global supply chain disruptions, including an unprecedented delay in launching the 5G iPhone 12 series. Instead of its usual September launch event, Apple didn't unveil its line of iPhone 12s until Oct. 13.
Despite ongoing challenges – including a continued global chip shortage – Apple has kept busy in 2021. The company has introduced several new products including AirTag trackers, refreshed iPad Pros, and new multi-colored, M1-powered 24-inch iMacs. 
And come Sept. 14, the company is widely expected to unveil a full slate of compelling new product releases.
Here are the new Apple products we believe will be announced at the Sept. 14 event (or a potential second event in the coming months). This list includes sure bets such as the iPhone 13, as well as longshots like an all-new MacBook Air.

iPhone 13
Apple still derives nearly half of its total revenue from iPhone sales. Also, iPhone use helps to drive the company's increasingly vital Services revenue. 
Thus, without a doubt, the single-biggest product launch for Apple in 2021 will be the iPhone 13. 
2020's iPhone 12 was a massive release; 5G support appeared for the first time, triggering what several analysts deemed an ""upgrade supercycle."" This year's model is likely to be more modest in terms of new technology and design changes (what used to be called an ""S"" release), but don't underestimate the demand for Apple's latest and greatest smartphone.
Just like it did last year, Apple is expected to debut two iPhone 13 models:
6.1-inch iPhone 13
5.4-inch iPhone 13 Mini
It also should release two iPhone Pro models:
6.1-inch iPhone Pro
6.5-inch iPhone 13 Pro Max
The big selling points for 2021 are expected to be 120Hz ProMotion displays for the iPhone Pro models, camera improvements across the board, a slightly smaller FaceID notch, support for faster mmWave 5G technology, larger batteries and Wi-Fi 6E support. As always, different case colors are a possibility.
Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives said he expected a ""normal"" launch for the iPhone 13, which suggested a return to a mid-September event to announce the new models. Sure enough, Apple's announcement of a Sept. 14 unveiling puts the iPhone maker back on track.

Apple Watch Series 7
Now that Google parent Alphabet owns Fitbit and has also released its new Wear OS 3 smartwatch platform (with partners including Samsung), the Apple Watch release that should arrive this fall takes on new importance.
Leaked renders for the Apple Watch Series 7 point to a redesign that sees the smartwatch shift from rounded edges to the flat-edged design the company has adopted in recent product releases, including the iPhone 12, iPad Pro and iMac. It appears Apple will keep the existing 44mm and 40mm sizes. However, smaller bezels (the space between the frame and the screen) would mean bigger display sizes for both versions; improved display lamination technology should make them thinner as well.
If Apple is able to shrink the S7 chip as rumored, that would provide more room for a battery, addressing one of the biggest complaints about the Apple Watch: battery life. Regardless of size, expect the new processor to offer faster performance.
We also could see new case colors for the Apple Watch Series 7.

AirPods 3
Apple's true wireless earbuds – AirPods – are Apple's unexpected runaway hit. They still dominate the global wireless headphone market, accounting for nearly 50% of sales. Varying estimates peg annual AirPod revenues between $10 billion and $12 billion.
The second-generation AirPods were released in spring 2019, and they are overdue for an update. Rumors about a potential AirPods 3 launch have the buds adopting a design that resembles the more expensive AirPods Pro, including shorter stems and silicone eartips for a more customized fit. The new form factor should also translate into a redesigned charge case. 
Better battery life is expected, too, as the current AirPods are now near the bottom of the pack in that respect compared to the competition. 
Support for Apple's new 3D Spatial Audio is a possibility.

iPad 9
The entry-level iPad is Apple's most affordable model. The company is widely expected to release a new, ninth-generation version of its low-cost iPad this fall.
Considering its low price point (currently starting at $329), don't expect to see the iPad 9 feature the latest and greatest processors or a major redesign. That means the Touch ID button is likely to remain, while the processor will be bumped up to the A13 or possibly the A14. 
Speculation earlier this year had the base storage getting a bump from 32GB to a more useful 64GB, but rising prices for NAND flash memory might make that move too expensive. 
If Apple makes the tablet slightly thinner, as rumored, that should also shave an ounce or so off its weight.
Finally, there have been whispers that the iPad 9 might see its starting price drop to $299 – the current price for educational customers. But again, with the current chip shortage raising the price of components, take that rumor with a grain of salt.

iPad Mini 6
Apple last refreshed the iPad Mini in March 2019. With other iPads receiving annual updates these days, a new version of the iPad Mini is long overdue.
If Apple does release an iPad Mini 6, it's expected to be the same approximate size as its predecessor, but with a larger, 8.5-inch display. That would be accomplished by reducing display bezels and going with an all-screen design (losing the Home button in favor of Touch ID on the power button), like the company did most recently with the iPad Air.
Naturally, it should get a faster processor as well, likely an A14 or A15. The Lightning port is expected to be dropped in favor of USB-C.
One rumor has the new iPad Mini tipped to adopt a mini-LED display, using technology first seen in the latest 12.9-inch iPad Pro. That would be a major improvement over its already impressive Retina display, but MacRumors notes that display analyst Ross Young disputed this report.
Other possibilities include a move to Apple's flat-edged design, as well as new case colors.

M1X or M2 MacBook Pro
Apple announced its new, custom-designed M1 processor last fall. With the M1, the company is following the strategy that helped to make the iPhone so successful. By controlling the processor instead of relying on Intel, Apple can now fully optimize performance of its Mac computers, incorporate special features (like the ability to run iOS apps) and control the pace of hardware development.
The 13-inch MacBook Pro and MacBook Air were the first Apple laptops to get the M1 chip. They received accolades for increased performance and power efficiency, but they were otherwise unchanged from the Intel versions.
This fall, look for Apple to unveil new MacBook Pro models that incorporate the company's latest silicon (M1X or M2 are frontrunners for the chip name). They are widely expected to adopt a new design, with the slim bezels and flat edges Apple has been using of late.
The new MacBook Pros are expected to come in 14-inch and 16-inch models. Displays might be mini-LED. The MacBook Pro webcam is expected to be upgraded to the 1080p model that was included with the new 24-inch M1 iMac. The controversial Touch Bar is predicted to disappear.
Speaking of controversy: Apple has dealt with more than its share of guff over the decision in 2016 to move the MacBook Pro to all USB-C ports, including for power. The rumor mill has been running hot over the possibility that Apple has given in to user demands, and will be expanding the port selection with the new MacBook Pro models. This could mean adding back an SD card slot, and possibly a USB Type-A port, plus a return to MagSafe charging port instead of USB-C.
The latest version of Apple's processor is expected to deliver a big performance boost over the M1 chip. It should offer a choice of 16 or 32 GPU cores, and support for up to 64GB of RAM (the M1 supports only 16GB).

M1X Mac Mini
The Mac Mini is one of Apple's most beloved computer products. The tiny PC is the cheapest Mac option because it lacks a display, keyboard, and mouse. The base model is a capable home PC, and is popular for use as a home theater server. It also can be ordered with more powerful components for professional applications and even mounted in racks for an affordable data center solution.
The Mac Mini was in the first wave of Apple computers to get an M1 processor option last fall. However, it looks a though Apple is planning to take the Mac Mini to the next level, with an M1X-powered version.
MacRumors reports that in the latest edition of his Power On newsletter, Bloomberg's Mark Gurman says to expect a new, high-end M1X Mac Mini sometime in the next few months. Unlike the M1 Mac Mini from 2020, the M1X version would feature a new design that shrinks the form factor further but adds more ports. 
The M1X Mac Mini would likely be aimed at the professional crowd and would replace existing Intel options remaining in the lineup, with the 2020 M1 Mac Mini staying as the affordable, consumer-focused option.

Longshots
It's entirely possible we'll hear about additional Apple products at its fall 2021 special event(s). There are a few distinct possibilities – a couple things that are expected to be released at some point, and one that’s mostly just rumors at this point. But any of these longshots have the potential to be an infamous Apple ""one more thing"" reveal.
After Apple released the thin, 24-inch M1 iMac in multiple colors, it paved the path for two potential additional releases, which are likely to come at some point, even if it’s not this fall:
The first is a larger iMac to replace the current 27-inch model. This release might have been awaiting the more powerful M1X/M2 processor expected to debut in new MacBook Pros. With those processors now in production, the door is opened for a powerful, colorful, thin iMac with a larger display – possibly 30 inches – for the professional crowd.
The M1 MacBook Air was a big leap forward in performance, but the look remained the same. However, Apple is rumored to be working on an all-new MacBook Air. This rumor suggests a complete redesign, including a mini-LED display, flat edges, MagSafe charging, plus multiple case color options such as those offered by the 24-inch M1 iMac. Most rumors point to a 2022 release date, but it's possible Apple might announce this alongside new MacBook Pros in the fall.
And then there’s the really long longshot.
It's no secret that Apple is not making the headway it wanted to in the home speaker market. In fact, Apple killed off its original HomePod speaker this year, leaving just the HomePod Mini behind.
Apple also continues to struggle to gain traction with its Apple TV video streamers, which hold low-single-digit market share and trail the likes of Roku and Chromecast. These give Apple a living room presence and help to boost Apple TV+ video streaming adoption.
Rumors began circulating earlier this year about a product that would solve both problems: an AppleTV/HomePod hybrid soundbar. 
The approach has worked for Roku, so it wouldn't be a stretch for Apple to give it a shot. In addition, if Apple were to integrate a camera, it would have a FaceTime competitor to the likes of the Amazon Echo Show.
Again, this is a long-long-longshot. But if Apple were developing this device, the company would want it on store shelves in time for the holiday shopping season. That would mean a fall announcement.

2021-08-19 00:00:00+00:00,Intel details mixed-source chip strategy and TSMC partnerships,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intel-details-mixed-source-chip-strategy-and-tsmc-partnerships-2021-08-19,,,"By Stephen Nellis
Aug 19 (Reuters) - Intel Corp INTC.O on Thursday gave new details of its turnaround strategy to source subcomponents of its chips from external factories, including new specifics of partnerships with rival Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC) 2330.TW.
Intel is one of the few remaining semiconductor firms that still designs and manufactures its own chips. But it lost its lead in making the fastest chips to TSMC, which focuses on manufacturing designs from outside firms, after missteps in its manufacturing operations.
Intel Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger earlier this year outlined the company's strategy to regain its footing in manufacturing by 2025. But in the meantime, Intel is trying to prevent further erosion of its chip market share by rivals such as Advanced Micro Devices Inc AMD.O and Nvidia Corp NVDA.O, who have faster offerings.
Part of Intel's answer involves tapping rivals like TSMC for subcomponents of chips called ""tiles"" and stitching those together in Intel's own factories with packaging technology. Intel on Thursday said its new ""Ponte Vecchio"" chip will use key tiles made with TMSC's ""N5"" and ""N7"" chipmaking technologies, placed on top of an Intel-made base.
The ""Ponte Vecchio"" chip's first major use will be in a supercomputer that Intel is building for the U.S. Department of Energy.
Raja Koduri, senior vice president of Intel's accelerated computing systems and graphics group, conceded it had been years since Intel challenged Nvidia at speeding up artificial intelligence software, a market that has powered much of the chip industry's expansion in recent years.
Koduri said the ""Ponte Vecchio"" chip is faster than Nvidia's offerings at some of those tasks.
""For a decade, we let them just have free reign,"" Koduri said. ""That ends now.""
Intel earlier this week also gave a new name to its graphics chips that will challenge Nvidia's other major market of video gaming.
Intel said Thursday its ""Alchemist"" graphics chips will be made by TSMC using the latter's newly named ""N6"" chipmaking technology, an upgraded version of its ""N7"" technology. Reuters reported in January that Intel would use TSMC's upgraded technology.

2021-08-18 00:00:00+00:00,3 Attractive Dividend Stocks Whose Dividends Could Double,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-attractive-dividend-stocks-whose-dividends-could-double-2021-08-18,,,"The market's highest-yielding stocks aren't always the best investments. Their yields could simply be high because their stocks crashed, and they might be spending more than 100% of their earnings and free cash flow (FCF) on their dividends -- which indicates a dividend cut will likely occur.
Instead of chasing high yields, investors should focus on well-run companies that can afford to double their dividends because they generate robust earnings and FCF growth. These companies might pay lower yields now, but their stocks will likely outperform sluggish high-yielding stocks over the long term. These three stocks fit the bill: Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), and ASML (NASDAQ: ASML).
1. Apple
Apple started paying dividends again in 2012 -- more than 16 years after it halted its original dividend -- and it's raised that payout every subsequent year. But Apple only spent 15% of its FCF on its dividends over the past 12 months, and it pays a paltry forward yield of 0.6%.
Image source: Apple.
Apple's dividend remains low for two reasons. First, it prefers to spend its FCF on buybacks ($82.4 billion over the past 12 months) instead of dividends ($14.3 billion).
Second, Apple continues to spend its cash on refreshing its hardware products, expanding its software and services ecosystem, and investing in next-gen markets like augmented reality and connected cars.
But Apple already has plenty of cash to achieve those goals. It ended last quarter with $72 billion in net cash (and $194 billion in cash plus marketable securities), so it can easily afford to double (or even triple) its current dividend while dialing back its aggressive buybacks.
Analysts expect Apple's revenue and earnings to rise 29% and 58%, respectively, this year, as it sells more 5G iPhones and its services lock in more subscribers. Those are robust growth rates for a stock that trades at 28 times forward earnings, but boosting its dividend could make it even more appealing.
2. Nvidia
Nvidia also started paying dividends in 2012, but the chipmaker hasn't impressed income investors with its tiny forward yield of 0.08% and inconsistent dividend hikes. Nvidia spent just 7% of its FCF on those payments over the past 12 months, so it's clearly more interested in expanding its business than paying out big dividends.
That makes sense, since Nvidia needs to maintain its lead against AMD in the discrete GPU market while developing new high-end GPUs for data centers and driverless cars. It's also been inorganically expanding with its takeover of Mellanox last year and its planned purchase of Arm Holdings.
However, its proposed $40 billion purchase of Arm, the world's top mobile chip designer, has run into a wall of opposition from antitrust regulators. If that takeover fails, Nvidia could repurchase shares or boost its dividend -- as Qualcomm did after its failed takeover of NXP -- to appease investors.
Analysts expect Nvidia's revenue and earnings to rise 49% and 58%, respectively, this year, as it sells more gaming and data center chips. The stock remains surprisingly cheap at 12 times forward earnings, and a big dividend boost could make it an even more attractive investment.
3. ASML
The Dutch semiconductor equipment maker ASML started paying dividends in 2008 and has raised its payout annually over the past five years. It currently pays a forward yield of 0.4%, but it spent just 18% of its FCF on those dividends over the past 12 months.
ASML's dividends are low for two reasons. First, it favors buybacks over dividends, which used up $5.1 billion and $1.4 billion of its FCF, respectively, over the past 12 months. Second, ASML's stock roughly quadrupled over the past three years and reduced its dividend yield.
Image source: Getty Images.
ASML dominates the market for high-end lithography machines, which TSMC, Samsung, and Intel all require to manufacture their smallest chips. The global chip shortage -- as well as escalating competition between the world's top chipmakers -- is fueling an insatiable demand for ASML's systems.
That's why ASML's stock skyrocketed, and why analysts expect its momentum to continue with 41% sales growth and 65% earnings growth this year. Its stock isn't cheap at 44 times forward earnings, but its position as a linchpin of the global semiconductor market arguably justifies that higher valuation. If ASML doubles its dividend -- which it can easily afford to do -- it could become an even more attractive investment while convincing longer-term investors to ride out its cyclical peaks and troughs.

2021-08-18 00:00:00+00:00,EXCLUSIVE-Chipmaker GlobalFoundries files confidentially for U.S. IPO -sources,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/exclusive-chipmaker-globalfoundries-files-confidentially-for-u.s.-ipo-sources-2021-08-18,,,"By Anirban Sen and Krystal Hu
Aug 18 (Reuters) - GlobalFoundries Inc has filed confidentially with U.S regulators for an initial public offering (IPO) in New York that could value the chipmaker at around $25 billion, people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.
The move is the clearest sign yet that GlobalFoundries, which is owned by Abu Dhabi’s sovereign wealth fund Mubadala Investment Co MUDEV.UL, is not eager to accept a potential tie-up with Intel Corp INTC.O, which the Wall Street Journal reported last month was in talks to acquire the U.S. chipmaker.
GlobalFoundries is working with Morgan Stanley MS.N, Bank of America Corp BAC.N, JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N, Citigroup Inc C.N and Credit Suisse Group AG CSGN.S on the IPO preparations, the sources said.
GlobalFoundries is expected to reveal its IPO filing in October and go public by the end of the year or early next year, depending on how quickly its application is processed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the sources said.
The sources, who requested anonymity because the deliberations are confidential, cautioned that the chipmaker's plans were subject to market conditions and that the timing could change.
Intel has yet to make a formal offer for GlobalFoundries and may not do so, according to the sources. GlobalFoundries is concerned that such a combination would upset some of its key customers that compete with Intel, such as Advanced Micro Devices Inc AMD.O, the sources said. It could also face intense antitrust scrutiny from U.S. President Joe Biden's administration, which has become more hostile to transformative mergers, the sources added.
Mubadala, GlobalFoundries and Intel declined to comment. The banks, the SEC, Advanced Micro Devices and the White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
GlobalFoundries' IPO filing comes amid a boom in capital markets, with other high-profile names such as Robinhood Markets Inc HOOD.O, Coinbase Global COIN.O and Roblox Corp RBLX.N already taking advantage with public listings this year.
GlobalFoundries manufactures radio-frequency communications chips for 5G, automotive, and other specialized semiconductors, and has emerged as a major resource for companies such as Intel and Advanced Micro Devices that have outsourced parts of their chip production. It was created when Advanced Micro Devices spun off its manufacturing facilities in 2009 and Mubadala later merged it with Singapore’s Chartered Semiconductor Manufacturing Ltd.
GlobalFoundries CEO Tom Caulfield told Reuters in July the chipmaker was planning to go public in 2022. The chipmaker has pledged to boost output to meet robust demand and announced plans to build a second factory near its Malta, New York, headquarters to address the global chip shortage.

After a 25% gain in the past month, does Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) stock have more room to run?
Source: Fabio Alcini / Shutterstock.com
Investors who feel they’ve missed the long-awaited rally in AMD stock should be happy to hear that shares of the Sunnyvale, California-based semiconductor company likely have continued upside, especially after the stock pulled back in recent trading sessions.
With the stock now consolidating at $110, many analysts feel it won’t be long before it retests its 52-week high of $122.49 and could push beyond $125 per share. With its semiconductors in huge demand and an important acquisition finalized, AMD shareholders can look forward to more gains over the near term.
Xilinx Acquisition
Prior to its recent jump higher, AMD stock had been sitting right around $90 a share since August 2020. The main reason for the share price being stuck in neutral was lingering uncertainty related to the company’s $35 billion acquisition of fellow semiconductor company Xilinx (NASDAQ:XLNX).
7 Dividend Stocks to Avoid Until They Start to Shape Up Again
The deal has won praise from industry observers who say the addition of Xilinx will give AMD advanced capabilities in artificial intelligence and help the company expand into semiconductors made specifically for use in today’s vehicles. 
However, the Xilinx acquisition had to run a gauntlet of regulatory approvals around the world, which caused some hesitancy among institutional investors. AMD stock popped after it was revealed in July that regulators for the European Commission and in the United Kingdom had approved the deal, making its completion more certain. While regulators in China still need to weigh in on the acquisition, there have been media reports that authorities in Beijing are likely to bless the merger between AMD and Xilinx, providing further momentum to the stock.
While a smaller semiconductor company, Xilinx has rock-solid fundamentals and great technology to support AMD going forward. In its most recent quarterly earnings, Xilinx reported revenue of $879 million, up 21% from a year ago and near record levels. Xilinx also reported free cash flow of $373 million, up 42% from the same period of 2020. Xilinx has now reported $1.19 billion in free cash flow over the last 12 months.
Once the acquisition is finalized by the end of this year, Xilinx should help strengthen AMD financially and in terms of the products it can offer customers.
Strong Performance and Outlook
Aside from the pending acquisition of Xilinx, AMD continues to post strong financials of its own and attract bullish comments from respected Wall Street analysts. Bank of America recently designated the company a “top catchup candidate” and placed a “buy” rating and a $135 price target on AMD stock. In its analysis, Bank of America noted that AMD is currently trading at a big discount to its competitors, which include Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). AMD has “the strongest upward [earnings-per-share] revisions among chipmakers and a clear path to doubling EPS to about $5 per share,” said Bank of America.
In its just issued second quarter earnings, AMD reported revenue of $3.85 billion, up 99% from a year ago and ahead of the 93% revenue increase the company reported in the first quarter of this year. The company also reported earnings per share (EPS) of 58 cents, above analysts expectations of 47 cents. And, AMD raised its forward guidance, saying that it now expects revenue to grow 60% this year compared to 2020, up from previous guidance of 50% growth. AMD stock jumped 7% immediately after its latest quarterly results were announced.
Buy AMD Stock
The future looks very bright for AMD and shareholders should continue to benefit. The company is gaining market share with its semiconductors and microchips in important areas. Electric car maker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) recently chose AMD hardware to power the infotainment systems in its Model S and Model X vehicles. And AMD says half of the world’s supercomputers are powered by its central processing units (CPUs).
More and more analysts and pundits are pointing investors towards AMD stock, claiming its upside potential as a leading semiconductor designer should not be underestimated. While the median price target on AMD stock is currently $110, the majority of those analysts ratings were made before the company’s recent second quarter earnings and before approval of the Xilinx merger became more certain. In coming weeks, more analysts can be counted on to follow Bank of America’s lead and revise up their ratings and price targets on AMD stock.
Given all that it has going for it right now, AMD stock is a buy.

2021-08-18 00:00:00+00:00,3 Top Consumer Tech Stocks To Watch This Week,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-top-consumer-tech-stocks-to-watch-this-week-2021-08-18,,,"Should Investors Be Watching These Top Consumer Tech Stocks Now?
While the broader stock market reverses course from its record-setting streak, consumer tech stocks could be in an interesting position. Sure, the bear argument for the sector now would be the reduction in retail sales and consumer sentiment in July. However, the consumer tech industry stretches far and wide across markets. It is important to note that some of the companies in this sector were the top performers of 2020. As a result, I can see investors keeping a close eye on consumer tech stocks in thestock market today
For instance, we could take a look at the likes of Dell (NYSE: DELL) and Lyft (NASDAQ: LYFT). Arguably, both of these companies operate in rather distant fields from each other. But, the one factor linking the two is their application of tech to serve consumers. On one hand, Dell would likely continue to gain as coronavirus fears continue to extend work-from-home periods. On the other hand, the likes of Lyft could see more demand for its food delivery services among others. Additionally, Lyft is also reportedly working with Ford (NYSE: F) to develop self-driving cars for contactless ride-hailing services. This would show the constant innovation that the broader tech industry is mostly known for as well.
At the same time, another consumer tech company making headlines would be Square (NYSE: SQ). The California-based fintech firm mainly provides consumers with digital payment and related financial services. Despite the company’s current momentum amidst tailwinds in the digital payments industry, Square continues to press forward. Earlier this month, the company acquired Afterpay, a buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) service provider for $29 billion. Evidently, there is no shortage of excitement in the consumer tech world today. After considering all of this, could these consumer tech stocks be adding to your watchlist now?
Best Consumer Tech Stocks To Watch In August 2021
Uber Technologies Inc. (NYSE: UBER)
Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC)
Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT)
Uber Technologies Inc.
To begin with, we will be taking a look at Uber Technologies. If any company showcases the versatility of tech in the consumer space today, it would be Uber. For the most part, the California-based company is famous for its ride-sharing services. The likes of which were admittedly hit hard at the onslaught of the pandemic. Despite this setback, Uber, like many of its peers in the industry, has pivoted towards food delivery services. With improved delivery services, could UBER stock be worth buying?
Well, for one thing, Uber continues to wow investors on the financial front. In its latest quarter fiscal posted earlier this month, the company saw green across the board. Namely, Uber raked in a total revenue of $3.93 billion for the quarter. This marks an astounding 105% year-over-year increase. Additionally, the company also posted surges of 164% in net income and 156% in earnings per share over the same time. CEO Dara Khosrowshahi cited solid investments towards Uber’s drivers and offerings as a key growth driver for the quarter.
Even now, Uber continues to invest in its drivers. Yesterday, the company officially announced its ongoing partnership with GetUpside, a retail tech company. Through this partnership, Uber’s driver and delivery staff now have complete access to GetUpside’s fuel and convenience store promotions. This mainly includes a wide array of cashback promotions from gas refills and convenience store purchases.  Given the recent labor shortage, this would be a strategic play by Uber. Would all of this make UBER stock a top watch for you?

4 Top Semiconductor Stocks To Watch This Week
Best Lithium Battery Stocks To Buy Now? 4 To Know
Intel Corporation
Following that, we have the Intel Corporation. Safe to say, Intel would be another top player to consider in the consumer tech industry today. This would be the case as the company’s processor chips are vital components in countless laptops in use today. Not to mention, with the current resurgence in Delta variant cases globally, work-from-home trends continue to persist. As such, I could see Intel gaining momentum among consumer markets and investors now.
On top of Intel’s current position in the booming semiconductor industry, the company continues pressing forward on the operational front. In its second-quarter fiscal reported last month, Intel posted a total revenue of $19.63 billion on earnings per share of $1.24, exceeding its Q2 guidance. Furthermore, the company also saw record second-quarter revenue in its PC and Mobileye divisions. CEO Pat Gelsinger said, “Our second-quarter results show that our momentum is building, our execution is improving, and customers continue to choose us for leadership products.”
If that wasn’t enough, Intel also revealed the name of its high-performance graphics card brand, Intel Arc, this week. According to the company, the new graphics processing units (GPUs) are set to launch in the first quarter of 2022. This would mark a significant move by Intel as it expands into the hot GPU market now. Given all of this, will you be adding INTC stock to your watchlist this week?

Microsoft Corporation
Microsoft is next up on our list of the top consumer tech stocks in focus now. Similar to our previous entry, the company has a hand in the PC and laptop consumer markets. Aside from that, Microsoft is also known for its Windows operating system to its comprehensive Microsoft Azure cloud computing arm. More importantly, MSFT stock continues to gain towards newer heights with year-to-date gains of over 34%. Even against the backdrop of yesterday’s selloffs, MSFT stock remains mostly unaffected. This would go to show the strength of Microsoft’s core businesses as investors continue to flock towards the company’s shares. 
Speaking of the company’s business, Microsoft continues to bolster and expand its portfolio now. In a blog post earlier this week, the company confirmed that it has received an Authorization to Operate (ATO) from the U.S. Intelligence Community Directive. With this ATO, Microsoft’s Azure Government Top Secret cloud region can be made available to its designated markets. Simply put, this part of Azure is specially designed to “house and protect top-secret data” for the U.S. intelligence community.
Meanwhile, Microsoft is also reportedly investing in software startup Rubrik Inc. According to Bloomberg, the estimated funding is in the range of about $4 billion. Now, the duo is reportedly looking to jointly develop cybersecurity products focused on helping customers fight off ransomware attacks. With the alarming rise in ransomware attacks globally this year, this move makes sense. With Microsoft kicking into high gear across the board, will you be watching MSFT stock?

2021-08-17 00:00:00+00:00,INTC March 2022 Options Begin Trading,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intc-march-2022-options-begin-trading-2021-08-17,,,"Investors in Intel Corp (Symbol: INTC) saw new options become available today, for the March 2022 expiration. One of the key data points that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 213 days until expiration the newly available contracts represent a potential opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the INTC options chain for the new March 2022 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $50.00 strike price has a current bid of $3.15. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $50.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $46.85 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of INTC, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $52.95/share today.
Because the $50.00 strike represents an approximate 6% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 100%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 6.30% return on the cash commitment, or 10.80% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Intel Corp, and highlighting in green where the $50.00 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $55.00 strike price has a current bid of $3.20. If an investor was to purchase shares of INTC stock at the current price level of $52.95/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $55.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 9.92% if the stock gets called away at the March 2022 expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if INTC shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Intel Corp, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing INTC's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $55.00 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $55.00 strike represents an approximate 4% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 6.04% boost of extra return to the investor, or 10.36% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.
Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $52.95) to be 33%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

2021-08-16 00:00:00+00:00,"3 Reasons to Buy AMD, and 1 Reason to Sell",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-reasons-to-buy-amd-and-1-reason-to-sell-2021-08-16,,,"Once left for dead by investors, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) has become a force in the semiconductor industry. It now holds a technical lead over longtime archrival Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) and has scored many victories over GPU giant Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA).
Despite its growth, investors should pay closer attention to three reasons to buy more, as well as a critical vulnerability that could undermine the chip stock's success.
Image source: Getty Images.
Leadership
When I say ""leadership,"" I mean CEO Lisa Su. Su took the helm at AMD in 2014 and turned what was a penny stock on the verge of bankruptcy into a semiconductor powerhouse.
Su told CNN that she worked to turn things around by finding the areas where AMD could succeed. The company decided to focus on CPUs and GPUs and sold or closed its remaining businesses.
It then sought to speed up development. Even though the three-to-five-year chip development cycle limited what the company could do, she bought time by speeding up the ""tick-tock"" cycle developed by Intel. This meant it would improve manufacturing processes and develop new architecture simultaneously.
Over time, tech customers and investors alike began to believe in the comeback story. In 2017, AMD released its first Ryzen desktop and EYPC server processors, and its stock began to rise above penny-stock status.
Technical edge
Intel's struggles in moving beyond the 14 nm chip-making process also helped AMD. By 2018, signs of uncertainty began to appear regarding its 10 nm chip release, issues that linger to this day. It still has not released its Alder Lake 10 nm desktop CPU yet, though some analysts expect it to come out in Q4. In contrast, AMD has marketed 7 nm chips since 2019, and Intel does not expect to release its first 7 nm chip in 2023. Consequently, AMD finally surpassed Intel in the desktop market, claiming a 51% market share, according to PassMark Software.
According to Jon Peddie Research, AMD has not experienced an overall technical advantage against Nvidia, and its GPU market share stands at 19%. However, it has achieved some competitive victories over the GPU giant. Both Sony's PlayStation and Microsoft's Xbox gaming consoles run on AMD chips. AMD GPUs also power Tesla's vehicles.
Growth and valuation
The financials seem to reflect these technical successes, helping to make AMD a top growth stock to buy right now. For the first six months of 2021, revenue of $7.3 billion surged 96% compared with the first two quarters of 2020. Revenue growth, along with a slower increase in operating expenses, played a role in net income almost quadrupling to just under $1.3 billion. Also, while AMD may not maintain this pace as society reopens, the company still expects 60% overall revenue growth in 2021 compared with the prior year.
Despite these massive increases, AMD's P/E ratio has steadily dropped. Its multiple of 38 is its lowest valuation since Su took over as CEO. It also remains significantly cheaper than Nvidia, whose P/E ratio now approaches 95.
This likely means the stock has failed to price in the company's growth. AMD has only increased by more than 25% over the last 12 months, far behind Nvidia's growth of more than 80% during that time.
AMD data by YCharts
Reasons to sell: It does not own its fabs
However, this is not as negative as its dependence on Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC). AMD does not own fabs, meaning it depends on TSMC for its production. While TSMC currently holds a technical lead, it is in the geopolitically vulnerable country of Taiwan. Should tensions escalate between Taiwan and China, it could dramatically curtail AMD's output.
Additionally, GlobalFoundries, the company formed after AMD spun off its chip foundries, is now a potential acquisition target of its archrival Intel, according to those familiar with this issue. This possible deal and Intel's existing foundries could potentially offer an added advantage to Intel over time, meaning AMD investors should monitor any related developments.
The bottom line
Lisa Su's leadership has made AMD one of the most influential companies in the chip industry. Moreover, its valuation, especially relative to Nvidia, makes it a great buy despite the lack of control over manufacturing. While investors should consider AMD, they should also keep an eye on Intel and Taiwan-China relations.
