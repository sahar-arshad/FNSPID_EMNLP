2021-06-10 00:00:00+00:00,3 Dividend-Paying Tech Stocks to Buy Right Now,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-dividend-paying-tech-stocks-to-buy-right-now-2021-06-10,,,"Some of the best investments can come from buying stocks that consistently raise their dividend. These stocks, the steadiest of which can earn the designation as Dividend Aristocrats (S&P 500 companies that have raised their dividend for 25 straight years), can be a great addition to anyone's portfolio.
Here are three dividend-paying tech stocks that investors should consider buying right now.
1. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) is the global leader in semiconductor manufacturing. It's a pure-play foundry business, which means it manufactures semiconductors for other companies but doesn't actually sell to the end customer itself. This has allowed TSMC to gain a tremendous lead in the foundry industry, with only a few companies like Samsung and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) getting close to its technological capabilities.

Currently, TSMC has a 1.53% dividend yield. With the global semiconductor shortage and a secular tailwind for its products, the company should have tons of demand for years to come. In fact, it plans to spend a whopping $100 billion in capital expenditures over the next three years, showing the demand its end customers have for semiconductors at the moment. TSMC is the sole supplier of Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), which is rebuilding all of its computing devices like the iPhone and Mac computers with custom chips it designs.
TSMC's dividend has grown most years over the past decade, from $0.52 per share in 2012 to $1.78 per share in 2020. With a stable business, huge demand for its products, and minimal competition, TSMC should be able to grow its dividend for the next decade and beyond.
2. Cisco Systems
Cisco Systems (NASDAQ: CSCO) is one of the forgotten tech giants of the late 1990s tech bubble that has since matured into a steady business with consistent cash generation. Its products include networking hardware for wireless, data centers, and security solutions. In fact, according to the company, 85% of internet traffic goes through Cisco's solutions. Outside of networking hardware, Cisco has software products for networking, a Zoom Video Communications (NASDAQ: ZM) competitor in Webex, and some products for the Internet of Things industry. Cisco is essentially a computing conglomerate, albeit a mature one in a lot of low-growth markets.
But low growth is OK if you are looking for a safer investment that pays out a high dividend yield. Cisco's yield currently sits at 2.75%. Since 2011, the company has generated more than $10 billion in operating cash flow each year and has raised its dividend per share every year, from $0.12 in 2011 to $1.42 last year. This isn't a company that will be putting up high double-digit percentage sales growth anytime soon. But if you are looking for a consistent and growing dividend payer that is the dominant company in its industry, Cisco Systems is perfect for your portfolio.
3. Microsoft
At a dividend yield of only 0.89%, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) pays out a lot less of its free cash flow out to shareholders each year than Cisco or TSMC. It is also one of the largest companies in the world, with a market cap of $1.9 trillion, which might make investors think it doesn't have as much potential to grow its annual dividend. But the company has made some giant bets on the cloud and other services that are just starting to bear fruit, and they should help Microsoft consistently raise its dividend over the next decade even with the company already being so large.
For example, Azure, its cloud infrastructure segment, last quarter grew revenue 50% year over year and it still has a giant runway for growth as businesses slowly transition to the cloud. Microsoft HoloLens, its augmented reality glasses, is being used by the U.S. Army in a $21.9 billion contract that will be spent over the next decade. And on top of this, its core Microsoft Office business is doing just fine as well. Office 365, Microsoft's cloud subscription service, grew revenue 22% last quarter. The proliferation of these services has helped Microsoft grow its operating cash flow from $27 billion in 2011 to $60.7 billion last year. That number should steadily grow over the next decade, helping boost Microsoft's dividend payout at the same time.
Investor takeaway
These three stocks are not likely to blow investors away with high double-digit percentage revenue growth over the next decade. But all three have long-term competitive advantages, a strong track record of profitability, and should be able to raise their dividends consistently over the coming years. If you're looking for three tech dividend stocks to add to your portfolio, you can't get much better than Cisco, Microsoft, and TSMC.

2021-06-09 00:00:00+00:00,1 Popular Tech Stock to Avoid,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/1-popular-tech-stock-to-avoid-2021-06-09,,,"Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) is the leading manufacturer of central processing units (CPUs) for laptops, desktops, and data center servers. After launching the world's first microprocessor in 1971, Intel rose to prominence in the 1980s as its x86 chip architecture became the industry standard.
However, over the last five years Intel has struggled with unprecedented manufacturing problems. At the same time, Intel stock has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, and things may get worse in the coming decade. Here's what investors should know.

Personal computing problems
In 1965, Intel computer scientist Gordon Moore told Electronic Magazine that the number of components on a chip would double every year. This became known as Moore's Law, though it has been revised over time and now states that the number of transistors per chip will double roughly every two years, while the cost of computers will be cut in half over the same period. For decades Intel kept this cadence, releasing smaller and more powerful chips every two years.
The trouble started in 2012. At the time, Intel said it would launch 10nm chips by 2015. But manufacturing problems resulted in several delays, and Intel didn't release a 10nm mobile processor until 2019 -- four years later than originally planned.
Meanwhile, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) started shipping 10nm chips in 2017 and 7nm chips in 2019. That allowed its partner AMD (NASDAQ: AMD) to launch 7nm mobile processors in 2020. As a result, Intel has lost market share.

Despite releasing 10nm mobile chips in 2019, Intel has so far failed to deliver a 10nm desktop chip. By comparison, AMD brought a 7nm desktop processor to market in 2019. Again, Intel has lost market share.

In 2020, Apple decided to shift away from Intel's x86 CPUs, opting instead to design ARM-based M1 processors for Macs. Notably, Apple's M1 chips are made by TSMC -- now using a 5nm process -- and offer 3.5 times better performance and twice the battery life of previous Intel-based Macs.
This development is significant for two reasons: First, Intel is losing a big customer in Apple. Second, one in three developers use Mac, meaning Intel will likely lose a sizable portion of its developer base.
Data center problems
In 2021, after replacing CEO Bob Swan with Pat Gelsinger, Intel finally delivered a 10nm server CPU. By comparison, AMD launched a 7nm server CPU in 2019. Once again, Intel has lost market share.

But Intel's troubles are far from over. In 2018 Amazon started designing its own ARM-based Graviton processors for its data centers. These custom-built chips offer up to 40% better price performance than compute instances powered by x86 chips. Here again Intel is losing a big customer.
Bigger problems on the horizon
To summarize, Intel is losing ground on two fronts: AMD is gaining market share, and big tech companies are shifting to ARM technology. Currently, AMD is likely the bigger problem, but ARM CPUs are getting cheaper and more powerful by the year, which could make them the greater long-term threat.
In fact, according to Cathie Wood's Ark Invest, 99.9% of developers currently build software for x86 systems. But that figure could drop to 18% by 2030 as the remaining 82% shift to ARM-based systems.
Moreover, while x86 chips currently control 92% of the data center market, Ark believes that figure will drop to 27% by 2030. In other words, Intel's market share losses may accelerate in the coming decade.
All of this evidence leads me to one conclusion: Avoid this stock. That doesn't mean Intel's share price is going to plummet tomorrow; the company may outperform the market for several years to come, or maybe it won't -- no one knows the future. But given the trends, I think there are better places to invest your money.

2021-06-09 00:00:00+00:00,Will Applied Materials And Intel Stock Continue To Gain From Chip Shortage?,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/will-applied-materials-and-intel-stock-continue-to-gain-from-chip-shortage-2021-06-09,,,"Our theme on Stocks That Benefit From The Semiconductor Shortage – which includes chip companies with their own fabrication capacity and companies that produce machinery and tools for chipmaking – has outperformed this year, returning 30% year-to-date, compared to a return of 13% for the S&P 500. Now although there are some signs that the shortage is easing a bit for the auto sector, with car makers restarting some production lines they had previously idled, it’s safe to assume that demand for chips will continue to outstrip supply across the board, in the medium term. For example, the CEO of Intel (INTC), Pat Gelsinger, expects the shortage to last another two years. There are some other trends that could help the stocks in our theme. Western countries are looking to become more self-reliant with respect to semiconductor production, which is presently dominated by China and other countries in Asia, and this could boost demand for chip fabrication equipment. President Joe Biden’s infrastructure plan also includes $50 billion worth of subsidies for the semiconductor industry and this could also help bolster demand for fabrication equipment.
Within our theme, Applied Materials (AMAT) -a supplier of equipment, services, and software used in the production of semiconductor and display products – has been the strongest performer, with its stock price up by 62% year to date. On the other side, memory major Micron Technology (MU) has been the weakest performer, with its stock up by just about 11%.
[5/12/2021]
Our theme on Stocks That Benefit From The Semiconductor Shortage has returned 28% year-to-date, compared to a return of 13% for the S&P 500. The current chip shortage has gotten more severe over the last few weeks, spreading from the automotive industry which typically relies on legacy, lower margin chips, to more advanced chips used in areas such as consumer electronics. For instance, Apple recently hinted that sales of some of its iPads and Macs could be impacted in the coming quarters by the shortage of chips, while Samsung says that the supply crunch is impacting its television and appliance production.
Within our theme, companies that provide tools and machinery for chipmaking have performed the best this year. Investors expect that the current chip shortage and increasing push by the U.S. and the European Union to become more self-reliant with semiconductor production (which is currently dominated by China) is likely to boost demand for chip fabrication equipment. For instance, Applied Materials (AMAT), Brooks Automation (BRKS), and LAM Research (LRCX) have seen year-to-date returns of 53%, 35%, and 30% respectively.  Semiconductor companies with their own fabrication capacity – which are also part of our theme – have also fared reasonably well with Micron Technology (MU) stock up 20%,  Intel (INTC) up 18%, and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) up 15%. These companies should stand to benefit, to an extent, from the strong demand and price dynamics in the current market, while being somewhat insulated from the supply side constraints.
[4/29/2021] Stocks That Benefit From The Semiconductor Crunch
The semiconductor industry has been facing a severe supply crunch, driven by surging demand from the consumer electronics industry through Covid-19 and supply-side disruptions including a fire at a fabrication unit in Japan, the freezing weather in the southern United States, and drought in Taiwan. The auto industry is bearing the brunt of the shortfall, with OEMs including Toyota, Volkswagen, and GM having to scale back on production due to a lack of chips, and consumer electronics majors such as Apple are also beginning to feel the pinch. That said, there are a set of companies that stand to benefit from the current shortfall in chip production. For example, semiconductor players who have their own fab capacity stand to gain, as they could see higher price realization without seeing their costs escalate. Moreover, companies that produce tools and machinery for chipmaking should also benefit, as chipmakers expand budgets in order to add more production capacity. For example, Taiwan’s  TSMC said it will spend about $100 billion over the next three years to boost capacity, while Samsung Electronics plans to invest $116 billion into boosting production by 2030. Our theme on Stocks That Benefit From The Semiconductor Shortage has returned 32% year-to-date, compared to a return of 12% for the S&P 500. Below is a bit more about some of the stocks in our theme and how they have been performing this year.
Applied Materials (AMAT) supplies equipment, services, and software used in the production of semiconductor and display products. The stock has been the strongest performer within our theme, rising about 56% year-to-date, driven by strong demand for semiconductor equipment, and increasing production complexity in the industry.
Brooks Automation (BRKS) provides automation, vacuum, and instrumentation equipment for markets including the semiconductor and life sciences industry. The stock is up by about 46% year-to-date as the company is seeing higher demand for its products from the semiconductor space driven by the trends such as the Internet of Things, 5G wireless technology, and machine learning.
KLA Tencor (KLAC) is another supplier to the semiconductor production space, focused on process control and yield management solutions. The stock is up by about 25% year-to-date, driven by the current chip shortage, and calls from the U.S. government to strengthen the American semiconductor manufacturing industry.
Intel (INTC), one of the largest microprocessor makers, is also likely to benefit from the current supply crunch as it operates its own fabs, unlike rivals such as AMD and Qualcomm who are dependent on third parties. The company also recently indicated that it was in talks with companies that design chips for carmakers to produce their chips at Intel foundries. The stock is up 18% this year.

2021-06-07 00:00:00+00:00,Is Intel Stock a Buy?,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/is-intel-stock-a-buy-2021-06-07,,,"When Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) brought on a new CEO in February, some investors began asking whether the stock might now be a buy. The company led the PC semiconductor chip market in decades past but some management missteps amid the decline in PC sales created a situation where Intel fell behind both Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) and TSMC's client Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD).
Under CEO Pat Gelsinger, Intel has made some significant moves that could pave the way toward a return to the top spot in semiconductor production, but there are also indications that investors may need to exercise patience if they expect this chip stock to make that leap.
Intel's competitive advantage
At first glance, Intel does not appear to stand above its competition in any meaningful way. TSMC will probably soon develop a faster chip than the 7nm semiconductor it currently markets. This comes at a time when Intel has struggled to move beyond making 10nm chips without TSMC's help.
Image source: Getty Images.
That's not to say its competitive advantage couldn't soon improve. For one, with Gelsinger now in the CEO position, someone with an engineering background again runs the company. This could bring Intel's focus back to gaining a technological edge. Under the previous CEO, Intel appeared resigned to outsourcing manufacturing to TSMC. However, Gelsinger seems intent on reviving Intel's foundries, pledging $20 billion to expand the company's production capabilities.
Moreover, unlike AMD and other ""fabless"" companies, Intel does not outsource most of its manufacturing to TSMC, Samsung, and other fabs. This may eventually give Intel an edge since it operates foundries in the U.S. Today, approximately two-thirds of chip manufacturing worldwide now occurs in Taiwan, according to TrendForce. Taiwan has faced direct threats from neighboring China, which leaves the chip industry vulnerable to geopolitical forces beyond its control.
To this end, Gelsinger and other industry leaders have also lobbied the Biden administration for government subsidies to partially fund a revived, homegrown chip industry. Since Intel owns more fabs in the U.S. than any other company, it should give Intel a clear advantage if the political situation in Taiwan deteriorates.
The current geopolitical situation and a pressing chip shortage may also provide capital for making technological improvements, a process Intel has already started. With the chip development cycle taking between three and five years, investors will not know anytime soon whether Intel can catch TSMC. Nonetheless, AMD mounted a comeback in the mid-2010s when many observers believed it would not recover. Investors should not assume such a feat cannot happen again.
Valuation and financials
The good news for investors is that the market has priced Intel's current situation into its stock price. Intel sells for about 13 times its current earnings. This comes in well below AMD and TSMC, which trade at P/E ratios of 35 and 33, respectively. Consequently, some analysts see Intel as a dirt-cheap turnaround play.
Unfortunately for those going long on the stock, that valuation appears to reflect the company's growth rate. Intel's sales experienced a temporary increase due to heightened demand for chips during the pandemic. It reported revenue of $78 billion in 2020, 8% higher than 2019 levels.
However, the top-line surge did not trickle down to the bottom line. Generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) revenue fell by 1% in both the fourth quarter of 2020 and the first quarter of 2021 from year-ago levels. In Q1 2021, net income also dropped by 41% to $3.4 billion over the same period. Investors should note that net income would have fallen modestly due to rising sales costs. Nonetheless, Intel paid a $2.2 billion restructuring charge as it lost a patent infringement suit with VLSI in March.
Additionally, the company predicts $77 billion in revenue for fiscal 2021, a 1% drop from 2020. This may partially explain why Intel's stock price has fallen by about 7% over the last year. Also, if Intel meets expectations of $10.5 billion in free cash flow in 2021, it will come in at less than half of 2020's free cash flow of $21.5 billion.
INTC data by YCharts
However, the company plans capital spending of between $19 billion and $20 billion during 2021. This is well above the $14.3 billion allocated to capital expenditures in 2020, a development that could help the stock longer term.
Should you buy Intel stock?
Given the promising investments and the stagnant financials, Intel stock appears somewhat speculative.
In the company's favor, Gelsinger's plan to revive Intel and the increased capital spending does offer hope, particularly when paired with its modest P/E ratio. However, revenue, income, and free cash flow numbers again point in the wrong direction. Additionally, it will take years to know if Gelsinger's moves today will help revive Intel long term.
Such uncertainty indicates investors should proceed cautiously, if at all.

2021-06-07 00:00:00+00:00,NortonLifeLock & eBay: Value Tech Stocks Are Back In Favor,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/nortonlifelock-ebay%3A-value-tech-stocks-are-back-in-favor-2021-06-07,,,"Our theme of Value Tech Stocks is up by about 16% year-to-date, significantly outperforming the Nasdaq-100 index which is just about 8% higher over the same period. The theme is comprised of large-cap technology stocks that trade at a trailing price to earnings multiple of under 20x. We think the outperformance is likely to continue for a couple of reasons. Firstly, inflation has been trending higher globally and this could cause Central banks to re-think their stance on ultra-low interest rates. This should cause investors to continue rotating out of growth stocks into value stocks.  Moreover, most of the companies in our theme are mature tech names and should remain a play on increasing digitization of the economy following Covid-19.
Cybersecurity player NortonLifeLock (NLOK) has been the strongest performer within our theme, with its stock up by about 37% year-to-date, driven by better than expected Q4 2021 results, which were driven by higher demand for the company’s software, following high-profile cyber attacks in recent quarters. The company also recently announced plans to carry out a $1.5 billion share repurchase program. eBay (EBAY) stock has also fared quite well, rising by around 26%, driven by higher interest in e-commerce through the pandemic. On the other hand, video game maker Electronic Arts (EA) has been the weakest performer, with its stock down by about 1.5% year-to-date.
[5/5/21] Which Value Tech Stock Should You Pick?
Our theme of Value Tech Stocks is up by about 10% year-to-date, compared to the Nasdaq-100 which is up by just about 5% over the same period. The theme includes stocks from the tech sector that have a market cap of over $10 billion, trading at a trailing price to earnings multiple of under 20x. With Covid-19 cases well off their highs in the U.S. and about a third of the U.S. population now fully vaccinated,  investors are moving away from high growth stocks and Covid-19 winners toward cyclical and value stocks. Moreover, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen says that interest rates may have to rise somewhat to keep the economy from overheating and this is another factor that could help value names. We think that value technology stocks, in particular, look attractive at this juncture, considering that they also play on the broader theme of digitization and higher corporate IT budgets post the pandemic. Below is a bit more about how the stocks in our theme have been faring.
Intel stock (NASDAQ:INTC) has been one of the strongest performers within our theme, rising by about 17% year-to-date, driven by strong semiconductor demand, large new investment plans in the foundry space, and some changes at the top management level. Cisco stock (NASDAQ:CSCO) is up by about 14% year-to-date, as enterprises are likely to increase spending on network infrastructure post the pandemic, with overall corporate IT budgets also likely to trend higher. eBay stock (NASDAQ: EBAY) is also up 14% year-to-date, as the company sees some tailwinds from the shift to e-commerce through Covid-19. However, the stock has come under pressure lately due to lighter than expected guidance for the current quarter. Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) has been the worst performer within our theme, with its stock declining by -3.5% year-to-date.
[3/8/21] Will Rising Bond Yields Help Value Tech Stocks?
Our theme of Value Tech Stocks includes technology names with a market cap of over $10 billion that are trading at a trailing P/E of under 20x.  Although the theme has underperformed since 2017, rising by just about 31%, compared to the Nasdaq-100, which has more than doubled over the period, it has fared better this year, rising 1.5% year-to-date compared to the Nasdaq-100 which is down by over 4%. There’s a good chance these stocks could continue to outperform in 2021, as rising bond yields take some sheen off higher growth names with investors potentially rotating into value stocks. For perspective, the 10-year Treasury yield has risen from around 1.1% to 1.6% in just about a month. Now, value tech stocks might hit the sweet spot in this market as they trade at reasonable valuations while playing on the broader Covid-19 theme of greater digitization and higher corporate IT spends. Moreover, most of the names in our theme are mature tech companies that are incumbents in their respective segments. Within our theme, Intel stock (NASDAQ:INTC) has been the strongest performer, rising by about 20% year-to-date driven by strong semiconductor demand and some top management changes. On the other side, Marvell (NASDAQ: MRVL) a company that develops and produces semiconductors and related technology has underperformed on account of mixed quarterly earnings, with its stock declining by about 13% year-to-date.
[2/22/2021] Will Tech’s Old Guard Beat The Market In 2021?
Our theme of Value Tech Stocks has underperformed the market in recent years, rising by just about 29% since the end of 2017, compared to the S&P 500 which is up by about 46% over the same period. The theme includes tech companies that offer essential technology products and services, have a market capitalization of over $10 billion, and trade at a trailing price to earnings multiple of under 20x. In comparison, the broader NASDAQ index trades at a much higher 40x trailing P/E. However, we believe that the stocks in our theme have lower price risk in the current market environment, and at the same time could offer reasonable upside from increasing digitization and higher corporate IT spends following Covid-19. Below is a bit more about the stocks in the theme and some trends that could help to drive them higher in the near-term.
Intel stock (NASDAQ:INTC) stock has been the best performer within our theme this year so far, rising by about 26% since early January, driven by stronger than expected Q4 results and guidance for the current quarter, and also due to the appointment of new CEO Pat Gelsinger. Moreover, demand for semiconductors has been strong across the board, with many end-markets facing chip shortages. Intel, with its sizable production capacity, should stand to gain.
Cisco stock (NASDAQ:CSCO)  is up by about 2% year-to-date. The company has been witnessing weaker demand for its networking gear as the Covid-19 pandemic caused customers to postpone deployments and also due to stronger competition. However, IT spending is expected to rebound sharply as the pandemic wanes and Cisco should be well poised to benefit. Additionally, Cisco’s pivot to a more software-centric model should also help the stock.
Oracle stock (NYSE:ORCL) stock is down by about -5.5% year-to-date. Although revenues have faced pressure in recent years as the hardware and services segments have taken a hit, the company’s cloud operations, particularly its public cloud business, could unlock a lot of value. During its most recent quarter, the company said that revenue from its Gen 2 cloud was up over 100% year-over-year. As the public cloud business continues to gain scale and the company provides more transparency, investors could potentially re-rate the stock higher.
[Updated 1/20/2021] Value Tech Stocks 
Our indicative theme of Value Tech Stocks includes relatively mature businesses that offer essential technology products and services and trade at reasonable valuations. Specifically, we have picked tech companies that are trading at a trailing price to earnings multiple of under 20x and have a market capitalization of over $10 billion. Although these stocks haven’t really rallied since our last update in November, with the Covid-19 vaccines roll out gathering steam globally, it’s likely only a matter of time before broader economic growth returns, helping value stocks, including reasonably priced technology names. Here’s a quick rundown of some value stocks in our Value tech stocks theme.
Intel (INTC) has been out of favor with investors due to increasing preference for lower-cost ARM-based chipsets and a delay in its rollout of its next-generation 7nm CPUs. However, the stock is up by about 16% year-to-date, as investors have a favorable view of Intel’s recently announced top management shakeup, which will see VMware CEO and former Intel CTO Pat Gelsinger succeed current Intel CEO, Bob Swan.
Cisco (CSCO) stock has also been listless as corporations paired back on spending on networking gear through the Covid-19 recession. However, IT spending is likely to rebound sharply over 2021 and Cisco being the go-to company for enterprise networking solutions should benefit. The company’s gradual pivoting to a more software-driven model should also help the stock. The stock is up by about 1.5% this year.
Oracle (ORCL) is a provider of database, cloud, and enterprise software products. The stock has seen steady growth over the last several years, driven by expanding earnings and its share repurchase program. The company has been expanding sales of its cloud-based applications, such as Fusion and enterprise resourcing planning services, helping to offset the slow growth of its legacy offerings. The stock is down by about -4.5% this year.
NetApp (NTAP) is a company that sells hardware and software focused on data management. While the company has seen a mixed performance in recent quarters, due to weak demand from large customers and its significant reliance on hardware sales, its increasing focus on the cloud computing market should help the stock. The stock is down 2.5% year to date.
[ Updated 11/24/2020] Is it A Good Time To Double Down On Value Tech Stocks?
Value Tech Stocks such as Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) have had a mixed year. There was good reason for this, as the deep Covid-19 recession, abundant liquidity following interest rate cuts, and the growing at-home economy drove investors to hyper-growth software as service stocks, high-risk, high reward sectors such as electric vehicles, and fast-growing platform players such as Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).
However, with the availability of multiple highly effective Covid-19 vaccines (Pfizer, Moderna, and AstraZeneca have published strong efficacy data on their vaccines) looking likely in 2021, things are likely to gradually start returning to normal. Moreover, the Fed could also eventually revisit its stance on ultra-low interest rates as the economy shows signs of picking up.  As this plays out investors could re-visit lower growth stocks that represent compelling value. While positive news about the vaccine earlier this month has already buoyed cyclical sectors such as energy, industrials, and financials we think it’s likely that funds will flow to value tech stocks in the near-to-medium term.
Our indicative theme of Value Tech Stocks includes relatively mature businesses that offer essential technology products and services and trade at reasonable valuations. Specifically, we have picked companies that are trading at a trailing price to earnings multiple of under 18x and have a market capitalization of over $10 billion. Key names in the theme include Oracle (ORCL) , VMware Inc (VMW), Seagate Technology (STX), Cisco (CSCO), and Intel (INTC).
[Updated 11/10/2020] Can Intel Stock Recover?
Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) stock has had a rough year, driven by delays in the company’s transition to the next generation 7-nano meter technology for its chips, some recent headwinds at its cloud and data center business, and strong competition from rival AMD in the PC and server CPU space. The stock is down by about 25% this year, significantly underperforming the NASDAQ which is up by over 28%. That said, there have been some positive developments that could help the company get back on track. In October, Intel announced a deal to sell its NAND business to SK Hynix for about $9 billion in a move that could allow the company to focus on its core CPU business, while bolstering its liquidity. Intel also appears to be more flexible with its manufacturing, recently noting that it could produce its next-gen chips in-house, or outsource them, or even use a hybrid model that leverages both internal and external fabs. Intel stock looks like good value at the moment, trading at just about 9.5x projected 2020 earnings. While growth could remain tepid in the near-term, Intel’s scale, its vast marketing and distribution footprint, and its large base of corporate customers, who rely on Intel processors and are likely averse to switching, should help the company in the medium to long-term.
See our indicative theme on Value Tech Stocks for a complete list of technology companies – including Intel, NetApp, and Oracle – that look like good value at the moment. The theme has underperformed this year, remaining roughly flat year-to-date, versus the S&P 500 which is up by about 10%.
[Updated 9/3/2020] Value Tech Stocks
While high-growth information technology stocks have rallied sharply this year, with valuations looking increasingly stretched, we’ve picked a few stocks including Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), and NetApp (NASDAQ:NTAP) that have relatively stable and mature businesses and still offer good value. Specifically, we have picked companies that are trading at a trailing price to earnings multiple of under 18x and have a market capitalization of over $10 billion. See our analysis Value Tech Stocks for more details on the returns and performance of these stocks. Parts of the analysis are summarized below.
Intel ($215 billion market cap, -15% YTD), the largest CPU vendor has been somewhat out of favor with investors on account of increasing competition from lower-cost ARM-based chipsets and the company’s delay in its rollout of its next-generation 7nm CPUs. However, Intel looks like good value considering its large base of existing customers, who rely on Intel processors and are likely averse to switch and also due to its vast marketing and distribution footprint. The stock trades at about 11x 2019 earnings.
Cisco ($178 billion market cap, -10% YTD), one of the largest network equipment providers, has also underperformed the market as it has struggled with top-line and bottom-line growth. However, the increasing digitization caused by the Covid-19 pandemic could drive demand for connectivity, in turn improving sales of Cisco’s networking software, and products such as switches and routers. The stock trades at about 16x FY’19 earnings.
NetApp ($10 billion market cap, -25% YTD) is a company that sells hardware and software focused on data management. While the company has seen a mixed performance this year due to weak demand from large customers and its significant reliance on hardware sales, it is looking to double down on the cloud computing market. Last month, NetApp closed a deal to acquire Spot, a leader in compute management, and cost optimization for public clouds. The stock currently trades at about 13x last fiscal year earnings.

2021-06-07 00:00:00+00:00,Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) Has A Pretty Healthy Balance Sheet,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intel-nasdaq%3Aintc-has-a-pretty-healthy-balance-sheet-2021-06-07,,,"Warren Buffett famously said, 'Volatility is far from synonymous with risk.' So it might be obvious that you need to consider debt, when you think about how risky any given stock is, because too much debt can sink a company. We can see that Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) does use debt in its business. But the real question is whether this debt is making the company risky.
When Is Debt A Problem?
Generally speaking, debt only becomes a real problem when a company can't easily pay it off, either by raising capital or with its own cash flow. Part and parcel of capitalism is the process of 'creative destruction' where failed businesses are mercilessly liquidated by their bankers. However, a more common (but still painful) scenario is that it has to raise new equity capital at a low price, thus permanently diluting shareholders. Of course, debt can be an important tool in businesses, particularly capital heavy businesses. When we examine debt levels, we first consider both cash and debt levels, together.
What Is Intel's Debt?
You can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that Intel had US$35.4b of debt in March 2021, down from US$39.9b, one year before. On the flip side, it has US$22.4b in cash leading to net debt of about US$13.0b.
NasdaqGS:INTC Debt to Equity History June 7th 2021
How Strong Is Intel's Balance Sheet?
We can see from the most recent balance sheet that Intel had liabilities of US$24.2b falling due within a year, and liabilities of US$46.7b due beyond that. On the other hand, it had cash of US$22.4b and US$7.42b worth of receivables due within a year. So its liabilities total US$41.0b more than the combination of its cash and short-term receivables.
Since publicly traded Intel shares are worth a very impressive total of US$231.7b, it seems unlikely that this level of liabilities would be a major threat. However, we do think it is worth keeping an eye on its balance sheet strength, as it may change over time.
We use two main ratios to inform us about debt levels relative to earnings. The first is net debt divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), while the second is how many times its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) covers its interest expense (or its interest cover, for short). The advantage of this approach is that we take into account both the absolute quantum of debt (with net debt to EBITDA) and the actual interest expenses associated with that debt (with its interest cover ratio).
Intel has a low net debt to EBITDA ratio of only 0.37. And its EBIT covers its interest expense a whopping 48.2 times over. So you could argue it is no more threatened by its debt than an elephant is by a mouse. But the bad news is that Intel has seen its EBIT plunge 11% in the last twelve months. We think hat kind of performance, if repeated frequently, could well lead to difficulties for the stock. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine Intel's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.
Finally, a business needs free cash flow to pay off debt; accounting profits just don't cut it. So the logical step is to look at the proportion of that EBIT that is matched by actual free cash flow. Over the most recent three years, Intel recorded free cash flow worth 70% of its EBIT, which is around normal, given free cash flow excludes interest and tax. This cold hard cash means it can reduce its debt when it wants to.
Our View
Intel's interest cover suggests it can handle its debt as easily as Cristiano Ronaldo could score a goal against an under 14's goalkeeper. But we must concede we find its EBIT growth rate has the opposite effect. Looking at all the aforementioned factors together, it strikes us that Intel can handle its debt fairly comfortably. On the plus side, this leverage can boost shareholder returns, but the potential downside is more risk of loss, so it's worth monitoring the balance sheet. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. These risks can be hard to spot. Every company has them, and we've spotted 1 warning sign for Intel you should know about.
Of course, if you're the type of investor who prefers buying stocks without the burden of debt, then don't hesitate to discover our exclusive list of net cash growth stocks, today.

2021-06-06 00:00:00+00:00,Better Buy: Advanced Micro Devices vs. NVIDIA,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/better-buy%3A-advanced-micro-devices-vs.-nvidia-2021-06-06,,,"A global chip shortage has helped send sales of semiconductors and related components through the roof, sending the stock prices of companies that design and sell chips skyrocketing, too. AMD (NASDAQ: AMD) and NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) are two of the hottest names in this space, and shares of the companies are up a respective 78% and 174% since the start of 2020.
These two companies are expected to continue growing at breakneck speeds for the rest of 2021. AMD and NVIDIA thus both deserve consideration for your portfolio if you're planning on buying and holding for at least a few years -- the longer the better -- and if you can tolerate some wild swings in price. But one looks like the better long-term purchase.

An all-purpose chip upstart making waves
AMD has been making a comeback for years with a fast-improving lineup of chips addressing the laptop and PC markets, as well as hardware for data centers and the cloud computing services built on them. Its battle has been primarily with Chipzilla, Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), which made over half of its nearly $78 billion in trailing-12-month sales from PCs and related hardware. AMD is tiny in comparison, with sales of just $11.4 billion over that same span of time. But a 70% surge in revenue over the last year (compared to Intel's 8% rise in revenue) implies AMD is scooping up lots of new market share at the expense of its larger peer.
AMD's plan of attack has centered around its suite of affordable CPUs (central processing units), GPUs (graphics processing units), and other processors for personal computing and enterprise data centers. But it's adding a new chip type to its arsenal, FPGAs (field programmable gate arrays), used in everything from data centers to networking to industrial equipment. AMD is getting into this space with the acquisition of FPGA leader Xilinx, and will test the mettle of Intel's FPGA business, which Intel acquired via two smaller peers: Altera and Omnitek.
AMD expects its revenue to increase 50% this year, but the real story here is its expanding profit margin. Historically, AMD has lagged behind many of its peers as far as profitability goes. But as it increases its market share and chip technology, it's making serious headway. Operating margin was 16% through the last 12-month stretch, compared to less than 10% at the onset of 2020 just a year and a half ago. Adding Xilinx to the mix should help AMD make further advances on this front.
Given its fast-growing sales and even faster-growing bottom line, AMD is reasonably priced at 38 times full-year expected earnings per share. Semiconductors and tech components follow a cyclical business model (sales ebb and flow with customer demand, which tends to revolve around new product launches and new tech capabilities), so don't expect sales to continue their torrid double-digit percentage pace for forever. But given its current momentum, AMD looks like a buy to me as the chip shortage keeps sales churning higher.
A leader in AI and high-tech advancement
NVIDIA got its start designing GPUs to enable high-end video game graphics, but it too has been chipping away at Intel's lead -- specifically in data centers. Intel's ""data center group"" quarterly revenue was nearly as much as NVIDIA's total income in the first quarter of 2021. But like AMD, NVIDIA is stealing away market share. Its revenue is up 47% over the trailing 12 months.
The company is quickly becoming more than just a semiconductor industry leader -- it's also a leading research and development company in high tech. In fact, spending on research and development was at 22.5% of sales over the last year, one of the highest rates among tech giants. NVIDIA aspires to lead the way in artificial intelligence, and its GPUs are well-suited to the task, in data centers, but also in personal devices as well. And in spite of its heavy spending, NVIDIA's operating margin was a very healthy 29% over the last one-year stretch.
AI requires crunching massive amounts of data, and this is an intense computing process that stretches the limits of CPUs. A GPU, by contrast, can accelerate the process many times over, all the while consuming less power than older CPU designs. Thus, many data center operators are adding NVIDIA GPUs to the mix, or outright replacing old hardware with new NVIDIA systems. Paired with its gaming business, this pushed NVIDIA's sales 84% higher in Q1. The company doesn't provide full-year guidance, but said to expect Q2 revenue to increase another 63% year-over-year in Q2.
NVIDIA trades for 41 times full-year expected earnings per share. It's a steep price tag, but NVIDIA is helping build a more efficient world with AI, applying it to all sorts of areas from vehicle safety and autonomy to healthcare research to cloud computing. For those looking at the long-term potential, NVIDIA is a great stock to own as it goes from GPU specialist to full-blown tech platform for the future of computing.
Which is the better buy?
AMD is the cheaper stock right now, especially considering its rapidly rising bottom line as years of investment finally start to pay off. AMD is certainly worthy of a buy in my book as it reaps the rewards from the global chip shortage.
However, I think NVIDIA is the better long-term investment. This is a semiconductor business through and through, but it's expanding its reach beyond tech component design and helping its customers make new applications utilizing AI. With a hand in all areas of cutting-edge technology, NVIDIA has many years of high-growth potential ahead of it despite the cyclical nature of its semiconductor-based business.

2021-06-06 00:00:00+00:00,5 Non-Tech Stocks Getting Hit by the Chip Shortage,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/5-non-tech-stocks-getting-hit-by-the-chip-shortage-2021-06-06,,,"The chip shortage that intensified last year didn't just spill over to 2021 but is getting worse. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), which was seemingly holding out against the shortage until now, expects supply constraints to hit its third-quarter revenue by $3 billion to $4 billion. Unprecedented demand for semiconductors has even caught leading manufacturer Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) off guard, with the company recently warning on at least two instances that it could take years to address the global chip shortage.
The thing is, tech stocks aren't the only ones feeling the pinch as the shortage has started to affect nearly every aspect of manufacturing. Here are four non-tech stocks getting hit by the chip shortage.
No chips hitting the brakes on trucking growth
U.S. retail sales for heavy-duty Class 8 trucks shot up 52.8% in April, reflecting strong recovery in truck markets. Problem is, demand is aplenty but supply isn't. Class 8 truck production fell nearly 8% per day in April, according to research firm FTR. Aside from parts, a shortage in the supply of chips has added to truckers' woes.
""2021 market size will be tempered by the industrywide under supply of semiconductors,"" said PACCAR's (NASDAQ: PCAR) CEO, Preston Freight, during the company's Q1 earnings conference call. The owner of Kenworth, Peterbilt, and DAF brands delivered 3,000 fewer units in Q1, and expects the trend to continue into the second quarter. PACCAR will boost truck production as the year progresses only if chip supply eases.

Worse yet, shortage of raw materials typically hits aftermarkets first as distributors prioritize supply to truck manufacturing. The chip shortage, therefore, could deal a double blow to PACCAR if things don't improve soon as the company derived 21% of its total revenue from parts segment last year. PACCAR last projected 15% to 18% growth in parts sales this year, but it remains to be seen whether it can meet its target.
Automakers are losing a lot of money
The automotive industry has been the hardest hit, and it's not surprising to see why. Semiconductors were already widely used in all cars for navigation, safety, and infotainment systems among others, but demand shot up alongside electric and autonomous cars. That explains why shares of electric-vehicle manufacturer NIO (NYSE: NIO) has dropped by double digits in recent months. NIO halted production temporarily in March, reported a 5.5% sequential drop in May deliveries, and expects chip shortage to hurt deliveries in Q2.
Closer to home, Ford (NYSE: F) alone expects a 50% drop in Q2 production and a loss of 1.1 million vehicles in 2021, which could cost it nearly $2.5 billion in adjusted earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT). Ford has shut down several plants, including some that build the Ranger and F-150 pickups. Although management projects chip constraints to bottom out in the second quarter, it expects the shortage to continue well into 2022.
Ford's sales, otherwise, have recovered sharply with the economy's reopening -- its April sales from the U.S. jumped 65% year over year. Ford's Q1 net income of $3.3 billion was, in fact, its best-ever first quarterly profit since 2011. The chip shortage, however, is a potential chink in its armor, and Ford's production cut could prove expensive this year.
No chip, no cars, fewer rentals
Auto manufacturers' chip supply woes have created the perfect storm for car rental companies. Vaccine rollouts is expected to stir pent-up demand for travel, but auto production cuts have throttled fleet expansion plans for rental companies.
Avis Budget Group (NASDAQ: CAR) reported 12% growth in revenue per day from Americas in its first quarter. However, its total revenue dropped 22% year over year and net loss widened by 8% in Q1. More importantly, management didn't provide full-year guidance as chip shortage added to the lingering uncertainty around the pandemic. ""The global semiconductor shortage is causing uncertainty in fleet supply and resulting in tighter fleets throughout the industry,"" management said during the Q1 earnings release.
CAR data by YCharts
Moreover, the shortage of new cars has forced car rental companies to fall back on used cars, but prices of used cars have shot through the roof already and are sitting at record highs. That's another thing investors in car rental stocks may want to keep in mind, especially in a stock like Avis Budget that's been on a dizzying climb in recent months.
Chip shortage hurting the unexpected
The global chip shortage has started to worry Caterpillar (NYSE: CAT). Semiconductor chips are widely used in construction equipment, mining trucks, oil and fuel pumps, and engine systems. Caterpillar also operates an autonomous mining fleet and is among the frontrunners in the industry to use Internet of Things technology for data mining and automation, all of which use chips.
In a recent interview with Reuters, Caterpillar CFO Andrew Bonfield warned the company may not be able to meet all end-user demand as shortage of chips could impact its production later this year. Supply constraints, including that of semiconductors, is in fact the key reason Caterpillar didn't provide any financial guidance for 2021 despite solid performance in Q1: Its worldwide machinery retail sales rose 13% in Q1, and its energy and transportation sales dipped only 5% compared with double-digit drops in each of the previous three quarters.
I expect easier comps for Caterpillar this year as 2020 was an exceptionally challenging year, but chip shortage could stymie growth for the world's largest construction and mining equipment manufacturer.
When will the chip shortage end?
Demand for chips continues to outstrip supply and adding production capacity can take months, which means expectations that supply constraints will bottom out anytime soon could still be optimistic. So although companies like Ford, NIO, Caterpillar, Avis Budget, and PACCAR are trying to navigate the crisis, the chip shortage will undeniably end up as a key growth hurdle for them in 2021, at least.

2021-06-05 00:00:00+00:00,This Industry Will Outperform the Market for Years to Come,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/this-industry-will-outperform-the-market-for-years-to-come-2021-06-05,,,"In this video, I will be talking about the gaming industry and why I believe this industry will outperform the market in the years to come.
The gaming market
When we think about gaming, it's not just video games anymore. It's everything from graphics cards -- AMD (NASDAQ: AMD), NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA), and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) -- to streaming to in-game purchases. Today, 45% of U.S. gamers are women. The average age of a gamer is 34. And the average household has two gamers. In fact, women represented around 65% of the total mobile gaming population and were observed to spend more on in-game purchases than male gamers.
Millennials became the largest generation in 2016. In 2021, they'll hit their peak purchasing power and will be the prime gaming demographic.
Now let's talk numbers. U.S. video game spending increased 30% in Q1 2021. Gamers downloaded around a billion titles every week in the quarter, up 15% year over year with games such as Among Us, Nintendo's Animal Crossing: New Horizons, and Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War among the best-selling and most-played games for the quarter. Google Play game downloads grew 20% year over year to 11 billion, while total consumer spend on gaming hit $22 billion. iOS gamers spent the most at $13 billion, up 30% year over year, while gamers spent $9 billion on Google Play, up 35%.
In-game cosmetics
Gaming over the past two decades has also given rise to live-service games, which are often free to play and are typically monetized via skins for in-game avatars. Brands are finding that in-app gaming experiences are a successful form of monetization. For example, Louis Vuitton announced in-game skins for League of Legends in 2019, which proved to be a popular cosmetic item for gamers. Fortnite, which is in the spotlight right now with the Epic Games v. Apple trial, has previously partnered up with Air Jordan, the NFL, soccer teams, and most recently Neymar Jr to bring real-world items into the game.
It's usually a win-win for the game and the brand. The most popular games, including Fortnite, Roblox, League of Legends, and Call of Duty, feature skins prominently. Big spenders called ""whales"" spend, on average, more than $15 a month on skins. The whales tend to be older. Almost 80% of Fortnite's recent players engage with its cosmetics in some way.
Streaming
According to Newzoo, there are 2.7 billion gamers, and that number is expected to surpass 3 billion in the next three years. NVIDIA estimates the number of Twitch streamers doubled in 2020, while Corsair (NASDAQ: CRSR) estimates that there were 6 million committed streamers last year. This growing market should support demand for Corsair's streaming products, such as microphones, streaming decks, and studio accessories. There's a reason why the stock has more than doubled since the pandemic started.
How can you invest?
There are various ways to get exposure to the gaming industry. The obvious ones are the gaming companies and publishers such as Electronic Arts (NASDAQ: EA), Activision (NASDAQ: ATVI), Nintendo (OTC: NTDOY), Tencent (OTC: TCEHY), Take-Two Interactive (NASDAQ: TTWO), or platforms such as Roblox (NYSE: RBLX) and Unity (NYSE: U). Then you have Sony (NYSE: SONY) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), who make two of the most popular consoles on the planet, the Xbox and Playstation as well as various games.
You could also get exposure outside of the U.S. by looking at companies like Bilibili (NASDAQ: BILI), Huya (NYSE: HUYA), or the great Singaporean internet company Sea Limited (NYSE: SE), which owns Garena, the maker of Free Fire (one of the most popular games today).
But if you don't want to pick individual stocks you could go the ETF route with VanEck Vectors Video Gaming and eSports ETF (NASDAQ: ESPO) or Global X Video Games & Esports ETF (NASDAQ: HERO), which are the two biggest ones that will get you exposed to most of the above-mentioned stocks.
During Netflix's (NASDAQ: NFLX) Q4 2018 earnings report, the company said its biggest competitors weren't other streaming platforms but video games like Fortnite. No wonder Netflix wants a piece of the video game market.

2021-06-05 00:00:00+00:00,3 Growth Stocks for In-the-Know Investors,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-growth-stocks-for-in-the-know-investors-2021-06-05,,,"For many investors, a search for new growth stocks often starts (and often ends) with the consideration of companies most familiar to them. Anyone who owns an iPhone is at least a bit familiar with its manufacturer, Apple. Amazon is another top-of-mind growth name. Even if you're not a customer, it's tough not to know of the company's -- and the stock's -- storied success.
The thing is, there's a slew of great growth stock stories out there that many investors have yet to hear about. Here are three under-the-radar prospects to check out.
United Microelectronics
Does the global chip shortage have you down? It has certainly taken a toll on some of the market's most notable tech names like Intel and Samsung, both of which recently reported quarterly results that were crimped by inadequate supplies of critical components. Chipmakers are working feverishly to meet unexpectedly strong demand, but it's not easy or cheap for most foundries to simply add production capacity.
This is a scenario, however, where smaller and more nimble semiconductor manufacturers may be in an ideal position to take some market share from bigger outfits. Perhaps the best prospect among these smaller chipmakers is United Microelectronics (NYSE: UMC).
Image source: Getty Images.
Taiwan-based United Microelectronics can make almost any chip the technology industry needs, but its core strength is logic and mixed-mode radio signal solutions (mixed-mode just means the component can handle analog and digital circuits, transposing such signals as needed). The good news is these sorts of chips account for about half the overall chip market. More relevant right now, United Microelectronics is planning on spending $1.5 billion on capacity improvements this year, and it has budgeted $3.6 billion worth of investments in increased capacity through 2023.
Too little, too late?
It's true that the most painful phase of the shortage is under way right now with easing expected to take shape in the latter half of this year. Easing isn't the same as ending, though, and Intel's CEO Pat Gelsinger fears the shortage could last past 2022, echoing worries from Taiwan Semiconductor CEO C. C. Wei. If they're right, United Microelectronics' capital expenditures will be money well spent even if they need some time before they start bearing fruit.
In the meantime, this lesser-known stock is in good position to rally out of a five-month rut once other investors learn of its plan to help solve an industrywide problem.
BigCommerce
Most in-the-know investors have heard of Shopify, the company keeping Amazon on its toes by offering business owners a means of establishing their own online stores rather than limiting them to listings on a marketplace owned by someone else.
Did you know, however, Shopify isn't the only outfit offering this solution? A smaller company called BigCommerce (NASDAQ: BIGC) is in the game as well, and it's finding similar success. First-quarter revenue was up 41% year over year, and while the bottom line is still in the red, its first-quarter adjusted operating loss was more than cut in half compared to the prior-year period.
Revenue growth should cool off through the remainder of 2021 to 30% for the full year, according to management's outlook, and analysts believe this trend will continue as growth slows to 22% in 2022. But BigCommerce is making progress on another important front -- given its outlook, the company should swing to a profit some time in 2023. The market's apt to buoy the stock as the company makes progress toward that goal.
And don't think for a minute BigCommerce has merely been lucky enough to be in the right place at the right time. It's impressed some high-profile users of its online store software. Ben & Jerry's, Gillette, and the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum are just a sampling of the organizations that have chosen this company's platform over plenty of other options.
MercadoLibre
Finally, add MercadoLibre (NASDAQ: MELI) to your list of growth stocks you may have never heard of but should know about.
It's often called the Amazon of Latin America, and while that's not a bad description, it is an incomplete one. MercadoLibre is also akin to eBay in that it facilitates online auctions, and it also mirrors PayPal with its online payment service that can be used outside of its own selling platforms. It's got a presence in 18 Latin American countries and is a market leader in most of them.
And it's growing! The company is serving 62% more active active accounts than it was serving at this point in 2020, and they're all spending more. Last quarter's 158% top line improvement to $1.38 billion (excluding currency fluctuations) was lifted by a 129% improvement in online payment volume and 114% growth in gross merchandise volume. That's the scale investors have been waiting on as the operating income of $91 million reversed the $30 million loss booked in the first quarter of last year. Not much more is expected for the current year on the profit front with the consensus 2021 earnings estimate last marked at $0.14 per share. Next year's projected sales growth of 39%, however, sets up what analysts believe will be per-share profit of $4.91 for the same year.
Too bold? Not really. S&P Global's recently upped 2021 GDP growth outlook for Latin America's six biggest economies now stands at 4.9%, to be followed by 2.8% growth in 2022. Moreover, eMarketer estimates Latin America's retail e-commerce industry will be the world's fastest-growing market this year, expanding at a clip of 37%.
Given this tailwind, the stock's 30% pullback from January's peak price looks like an entry opportunity.

2021-06-04 00:00:00+00:00,We Did The Math MGC Can Go To $163,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/we-did-the-math-mgc-can-go-to-%24163-2021-06-04,,,"Looking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at ETF Channel, we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. For the Vanguard Mega Cap ETF (Symbol: MGC), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $162.59 per unit.
With MGC trading at a recent price near $147.89 per unit, that means that analysts see 9.94% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of MGC's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are Intel Corp (Symbol: INTC), Medtronic PLC (Symbol: MDT), and Danaher Corp (Symbol: DHR). Although INTC has traded at a recent price of $56.24/share, the average analyst target is 13.02% higher at $63.56/share. Similarly, MDT has 11.77% upside from the recent share price of $123.07 if the average analyst target price of $137.55/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting DHR to reach a target price of $269.17/share, which is 11.68% above the recent price of $241.01. Below is a twelve month price history chart comparing the stock performance of INTC, MDT, and DHR:
Below is a summary table of the current analyst target prices discussed above:
NAME SYMBOL RECENT PRICE AVG. ANALYST 12-MO. TARGET % UPSIDE TO TARGET
Vanguard Mega Cap ETF MGC $147.89 $162.59 9.94%
Intel Corp INTC $56.24 $63.56 13.02%
Medtronic PLC MDT $123.07 $137.55 11.77%
Danaher Corp DHR $241.01 $269.17 11.68%
Are analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past. These are questions that require further investor research.

2021-06-04 00:00:00+00:00,Taiwan chip packager King Yuan to halt output after COVID cases at factory,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/taiwan-chip-packager-king-yuan-to-halt-output-after-covid-cases-at-factory-2021-06-04,,,"Recasts, adds detail
TAIPEI, June 4 (Reuters) - Major Taiwanese chip packager King Yuan Electronics 2449.TW said on Friday it will halt production on the island for two days after several employees contracted COVID-19, the first time the pandemic has hit the global chip hub, as case numbers climb.
The rare uptick in infections in tech heavyweight Taiwan, which has been model for how to control the pandemic, has triggered worries that a further outbreak could exacerbate a chip supply crunch that has hit global industries from auto to electronics.
Hsinchu-based King Yuan, one of the island's major chip packaging and testing firms, counts global tech giants including Intel INTC.O and Samsung Electronics 005930.KS among its biggest clients.
Starting Friday evening, King Yuan will halt production at factories across Taiwan for 48 hours for disinfection, the company said in a stock exchange filing.
King Yuan said it expected the halt to hit 4% to 6% of its output in June and will impact up to 6% of its revenue this month, adding it saw no significant impact to its business this year.
Sixty-seven employees mostly from the Philippines and working at a King Yuan factory in the northern city of Miaoli tested positive, Taiwan's health ministry said, adding it was planning to test more than 7,000 people there.
To stop outbreaks from spreading into other tech companies, Taiwan government has set up an emergency response team in Miaoli as well as rapid test stations in the major science park in Hsinchu.
Taiwan reported 472 new domestic COVID-19 cases on Friday, including 133 cases added to the totals for recent days as it continues to readjust its infection numbers following delays in reporting positive tests.
That was down from the 583 domestic infections reported on Thursday.
Taiwan has now reported 10,446 cases since the pandemic began, including 187 deaths.

June 3 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T is rebranding its corporate investment arm as Toyota Ventures and adding two early-stage funds, including one focused on investing in startups developing solutions for climate change and carbon neutrality.
The Japanese automaker is beefing up its four-year-old investment arm, formerly known as Toyota AI Ventures, with the addition of the $150 million Frontier Fund and the $150 million Climate Fund, Toyota said on Thursday, boosting total assets under management to more than $500 million.
The Frontier Fund will continue to invest in such areas as artificial intelligence, automated vehicles, cloud computing and robotics, while expanding its purview to include smart cities, digital health, fintech, materials and energy, the company said.
The Climate Fund will be focused on technologies and companies working on accelerating carbon dioxide reduction.
""We think there's going to be a tremendous amount of disruptive innovation in these areas,"" especially at startup companies, said Jim Adler, founding managing director of Toyota Ventures.
""Toyota wants us to look outside, into the startup community where companies are chasing the same kinds of goals as Toyota - lowering the carbon footprint and getting to carbon-neutral.""
Toyota's venture arm, since its founding in 2017, has invested in nearly 40 startups in a variety of sectors, from e-scooters to self-driving shuttles.
The venture group also has co-invested in several startups with the venture arms of BMW AG BMWG.DE, Hyundai Motor Co 005380.KS, Airbus SE AIR.PA and Intel Corp INTC.O.
Toyota has a second, newer venture arm called Woven Capital, which works with the company's Woven Planet team on future transportation strategy and investments.
Adler said Toyota Ventures will continue to focus its investments on early-stage companies, while Woven Capital aims to fund more mature growth-stage companies.

Although April's dismal numbers surprised and disappointed investors, the possibility of a red-hot May report tomorrow morning was enough to stoke inflation fears and, in turn, anxiety over interest rates.
""This morning’s economic data has rates moving higher,"" writes Michael Reinking, senior market strategist at the New York Stock Exchange. ""Just as the Street seemed to coalesce around the idea of another disappointing jobs number tomorrow, the ADP employment report came in at 1.5-times the Street estimate.

2021-06-01 00:00:00+00:00,TSMC says has begun construction at its Arizona chip factory site,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/tsmc-says-has-begun-construction-at-its-arizona-chip-factory-site-2021-06-01,,,"Adds more comments from CEO, context on TSMC
June 1 (Reuters) - Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd 2330.TW (TSMC) has started construction at a site in Arizona where it plans to spend $12 billion to build a computer chip factory, its chief executive said on Tuesday.
Speaking at the company's annual technology presentation to clients and investors, held online for the second straight year because of the pandemic, CEO C.C. Wei said the planned factory remains on track to start volume production of chips using the company's 5-nanometer production technology starting in 2024.
TSMC is expected to be one of several companies, including Intel Corp INTC.O and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd 005930.KS, competing for some of the $54 billion in subsides for the chip industry that advanced in the United States Senate last week.
Reuters previously reported that TSMC plans to build as many as six factories at the Arizona site over a 10- to 15-year span.
TSMC, the world's biggest manufacturer of semiconductors on contract, has taken centre-stage in the global supply chain equation amid a worldwide shortage of chips that is hurting industries from automobiles to consumer electronics.
Its shares have soared since the COVID-19 pandemic began, making it Asia's most valuable manufacturing company with a market capitalisation of $563 billion, more than twice that of Intel's.
TSMC announced in April a $100 billion investment plan over the next three years to increase capacity at its factories. Wei reiterated that number, which will include $30 billion in spending this year, at the presentation.
""That will give us enough manufacturing capacity to support the growth of our clients,"" he said.
Wei also said the company has developed a version of its 5-nanometer chipmaking process certified for use by automakers for advanced applications like artificial intelligence, though the new offering is unlikely to alleviate the current chip shortages because the shortages are of less advanced chips.
He said TSMC's next generation of 3-nanometer chipmaking technology remains on track to start volume production at the company's ""Fab 18"" factory in Tainan, Taiwan, in the second half of next year.

2021-05-31 00:00:00+00:00,"Forget the Stock Split, 3 Reasons NVIDIA Could Continue to Climb in 2021",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/forget-the-stock-split-3-reasons-nvidia-could-continue-to-climb-in-2021-2021-05-31,,,"NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) got its year started with a bang. In the fiscal first quarter of 2021 (the three months ended May 2, 2021) revenue increased 84% year over year to $5.66 billion, and adjusted earnings per share were up 106%. Ahead of the quarterly update, the semiconductor designer announced a 4-for-1 stock split. While stock splits don't have a material impact on a business's valuation, investors struck an upbeat tone on the news. Shares are now up 175.8% since the start of 2020.
Stock split aside, there's reason to believe NVIDIA's run isn't over. Chip demand is sky-high right now, and the company is a leader on multiple high-growth technology fronts. Let's look at three reasons why this stock could continue its upward movement in 2021.
Image source: Getty Images.
1. New gaming GPU upgrades are just getting started
NVIDIA got its start with high-end video game graphics, and the industry remains the company's largest market. Gaming sales were $2.76 billion in Q1, up a whopping 106% year over year. The surge is driven by the RTX 30 series GPUs released late last year. These advanced chips come standard with ray tracing and AI-enhanced graphics capabilities to help players get the most out of their gaming experience.
With such a boom in video game sales, it might seem like this leading segment at NVIDIA would be headed for a slowdown. That time hasn't arrived yet. The hardware upgrade cycle is really just getting started. NVIDIA just recently announced the first batch of laptops with RTX GPUs are coming out this summer, which makes its new chips available to tens of millions more gamers worldwide. And to better address video game market demand, NVIDIA has built restrictions in the RTX 30 series to prevent these graphics processors from going to cryptocurrency mining outfits (the new CMP chips custom designed for the crypto market are out and are expected to haul in $400 million in sales next quarter).
NVIDIA said it expects revenue to be about $6.3 billion in the second quarter, up 63% from a year ago at the midpoint. While cryptocurrency chips are contributing to this torrid pace of growth, the gaming and data center markets represent the lion's share of expansion.

2. Complex data centers need new tech hardware
Speaking of data centers, this has quickly emerged as NVIDIA's second-largest vertical. Sales were $2.05 billion in Q1, up a more-than-respectable 79% year over year.
Data centers operate behind the scenes but are critically important computing units in today's world. They operate the internet, mobile networks, the myriad of software services built and residing in them, and coordinate real-world activity like managing postal services and healthcare information. And in an increasingly sophisticated digital world, better hardware that is able to coordinate all this new data is needed. Lots of companies are adding GPUs to their data center designs as computing accelerators, or outright replacing older CPUs (central processing units) with faster and more energy-efficient GPUs. This is a space traditionally dominated by Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), but NVIDIA is gunning for the chip giant's haymaker. Last year, it unveiled a new data processing unit (DPU) and early in 2021 announced a CPU called Grace designed to pair with its GPUs and built from the ground up for modern data center applications like AI.
Just like its gaming business, data centers are in the early stages of getting upgraded. CFO Colette Kress said on theearnings callthat ""every industry is becoming a technology industry."" There's no shortage of growth opportunity for NVIDIA, especially in cloud-based services and AI as companies unlock new capabilities and get more efficient in their operations using new chip tech.
3. NVIDIA is not just a hardware company anymore
NVIDIA of course makes money from the sale of its semiconductors. Licensing revenue from selling chip designs will get a big boost from the pending ARM Holdings acquisition (which Kress said is still on track to be completed by early 2022), but there's a lot more to NVIDIA's business model these days.
Cloud-based recurring software-as-a-service (SaaS) revenue is a promising front for this chip company. Its auto industry platform is a prime example. Auto revenue was flat year over year in Q1 at $154 million as NVIDIA continues to exit commoditized vehicle infotainment hardware. But its Drive autonomous vehicle platform spans not just hardware but also software services, helping automakers and autonomous vehicle researchers advance self-driving and safety capabilities.
Another example is Omniverse, a new collaborative software platform for designers and creators of all sorts. Omniverse has been in open beta but will have a commercial launch this summer for both individual users and enterprises. Kress said there have been over 17,000 downloads of the open beta so far, indicating robust demand for this SaaS-based business line in short order.
Software sales will be a longer-term development for NVIDIA, but it nevertheless represents an exciting new outlet for this tech giant that pairs well with its leadership in GPUs. Innovation is firing on all cylinders at NVIDIA right now, and shares could continue their upward momentum through the back half of 2021 as growth continues at a rapid pace.

2021-05-30 00:00:00+00:00,Intel reiterates chip supply shortages could last several years,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intel-reiterates-chip-supply-shortages-could-last-several-years-2021-05-30,,,"TAIPEI, May 31 (Reuters) - Intel Corp's INTC.O CEO said on Monday it could take several years for a global shortage of semiconductors to be resolved, a problem that has shuttered some auto production lines and is also being felt in other areas, including consumer electronics.
Pat Gelsinger told a virtual session of the Computex trade show in Taipei that the work-and-study-from-home trend during the COVID-19 pandemic had led to a ""cycle of explosive growth in semiconductors"" that has placed huge strain on global supply chains.
""But while the industry has taken steps to address near term constraints it could still take a couple of years for the ecosystem to address shortages of foundry capacity, substrates and components.""
Gelsinger had told The Washington Post in an interview in mid-April the shortage was going to take ""a couple of years"" to abate, and that it planned to start producing chips within six to nine months to address shortages at U.S. car plants.
Intel announced a $20 billion plan in March to expand its advanced chip manufacturing capacity, building two factories in Arizona and opening its plants to outside customers.
""We plan to expand to other locations in the U.S. and Europe, ensuring a sustainable and secure semiconductor supply chain for the world,"" Gelsinger said, without elaborating.
Intel's plans could directly challenge the two other companies in the world that can make the most advanced chips - Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC) 2330.TW, TSM.N and South Korea's Samsung Electronics Co Ltd 005930.KS.
The two have come to dominate the semiconductor manufacturing business, moving its centre of gravity from the United States, where much of the technology was once invented, to Asia, where more than two-thirds of advanced chips are now manufactured.
