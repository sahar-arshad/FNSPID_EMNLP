2021-03-09 00:00:00+00:00,Apple Is Killing Off the iMac Pro,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/apple-is-killing-off-the-imac-pro-2021-03-09,,,"As soon as all the existing supplies of Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL) iMac Pro run out, it will be the end of the line for the desktop computer that made its first appearance in 2017 and was once the most powerful computer it made.
Apple has confirmed it is discontinuing the line after the sharp-eyed readers of the Apple news website MacRumors noticed a ""while supplies last"" tag on the iMac Pro's configuration web page.

The non-Pro iMac has since become Apple's most popular computer and in certain configurations challenged the Pro on performance (and price). Earlier this year, Bloomberg reported Apple intended to further update the iMac with a new design as it transitioned away from Intel's processors to its own M1 chips.
As its name suggested, the iMac Pro was not intended for the average consumer, but rather for those needing professional-level video editing, audio processing, and graphics capabilities. But all of that excess processing power came with a hefty starting price of $5,000, which could quickly run to over $10,000.
After its introduction, Apple failed to significantly update any of the Pro's hardware, and now with all the talk of sweeping changes to the base model, the discontinuation of the Pro version is not necessarily surprising. And with a spring event reportedly taking place this month, the tech giant may yet reveal what could become the successor to the iMac Pro.

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.

2021-03-08 00:00:00+00:00,This ETF Could Help Grow Your Retirement Account,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/this-etf-could-help-grow-your-retirement-account-2021-03-08,,,"When it comes to investing for your retirement, you might assume that you have two main choices: investing in individual stocks, some of which might grow very briskly, or investing in a broad-market index fund, which will deliver roughly the same return as the index it tracks. (Yes, you might also invest in actively managed mutual funds, but the bulk of them underperform their index counterparts over long periods, so let's ignore them for this article.)
There's another alternative to consider, though: exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which are funds that can be traded like stocks and often track indexes. Here's a look at one ETF that might help grow your assets for retirement -- along with a related one that you might also consider.

Meet the QQQ
The Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ: QQQ) is an ETF that tracks the Nasdaq-100 Index, which is composed of the 100 largest non-financial companies that trade on the Nasdaq market. As you might imagine, it's rather heavily weighted towards technology companies, though it omits the big ones that trade on the New York Stock Exchange, such as Salesforce.com (NYSE: CRM), IBM (NYSE: IBM) and Oracle (NYSE: ORCL).
As an index fund, it sports a low annual fee -- 0.20%. Considering that many non-index mutual funds charge 1% or more, this is a terrifically low fee (though some index funds charge even less). Low fees mean that you get to keep most of the fund's gains, instead of handing over a meaningful chunk to the fund company.
QQQ holdings
Here are the fund's top 10 holdings, as of early March 2021:
COMPANY
PERCENT OF ETF'S ASSETS
Apple
11.44%
Microsoft
9.44%
Amazon.com
8.31%
Tesla
4.44%
Alphabet Class C
3.62%
Facebook
3.35%
Alphabet
3.28%
NVIDIA
2.75%
PayPal
2.57%
Intel (NASDAQ: INTC)
2.07%
Data source: Morningstar.com.
With names like that in its roster, you might suspect that the fund has a good track record -- and you'd be right. Invesco notes that the ETF has been rated the best performer among large-cap growth funds, citing Lipper total return stats as of Dec. 31, 2020.
The QQQ ETF is terrific if you'd like to own chunks of roughly a hundred companies like the ones above, but understand that most of your investment will be in just four companies: Apple, Microsoft, Amazon.com, and Google parent Alphabet. Together those companies represent about 36% of the fund's value. If the 10th-largest holding represents just 2.07%, you can imagine that not too much of your money will be in holdings 99 or 100. Still, the oversized holdings are in companies that have been growing like gangbusters in recent years and may well keep doing so.
Image source: Getty Images.
A smaller alternative: the QQQJ
If you like the idea of the QQQ for your long-term portfolio but you'd also like some exposure to smaller companies, consider parking some of your money in the Invesco NASDAQ Next Gen 100 ETF (NASDAQ: QQQJ).
As the fund company explains, the ETF ""is based on the NASDAQ Next Generation 100 Index (Index) [and invests] at least 90% of its total assets in the securities that comprise the Index by investing in the 101st to the 200th largest companies on the NASDAQ."" So it's chock-full of large-cap and mid-cap non-financial companies, including many with a technology focus. Here's a recent list of its top holdings:
COMPANY
PERCENT OF ETF'S ASSETS
Roku
2.69%
CrowdStrike
2.41%
ViacomCBS
2.21%
The Trade Desk
2.02%
Etsy
1.79%
Zscaler
1.65%
Fortinet
1.63%
Zebra Technologies
1.62%
DraftKings
1.57%
Old Dominion Freight Line
1.50%
Data source: Morningstar.com.
One thing to note is that this fund is far less concentrated in its top holdings. Its annual fee is also a bit lower, at 0.15%.
Most of the companies in both top-10 lists have performed very strongly over the past year or so, leading some to worry that they may be overvalued and are more likely to retract a bit in the near future than keep surging. No one can know what any stock will do in the short term, so these funds are best thought of as long-term portfolio candidates. And if you're worried about possible overvaluation, you might opt to just park some of your available money in them now, and reserve some money to buy additional shares later when they may be priced lower.

March 5 (Reuters) - Wall Street ended sharply higher after a volatile session on Friday, with the Nasdaq rebounding at the end of a week that saw it extend losses to about 10% from its previous record high.
All three main indexes bounced back from losses earlier in the day, with investors in recent sessions spooked by rising interest rates that offset optimism about an economic rebound.
Microsoft MSFT.O rallied, boosting the S&P 500 more than any other stock, with gains in Alphabet GOOGL.O, Apple AAPL.O and Oracle ORCL.N also lifting the index.
The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yields US10YT=RR hit a new one-year high of 1.626% after nonfarm payrolls increased by 379,000 jobs last month, blowing past a rise of 182,000 forecast by economists polled by Reuters.
Focus is also on a $1.9 trillion coronavirus aid bill as a sharply divided U.S. Senate began what was expected to be a long debate over a slew of amendments on how that money would be spent.
The Nasdaq logged its third straight weekly decline after a recent spike in Treasury yields dented demand for high-flying technology stocks.
Rising interest rates disproportionately hurt high-growth tech companies because investors value them based on earnings expected years into the future, and high interest rates hurt the value of future earnings more than the value of earnings made in the short term.
The tech-heavy Nasdaq is around 8% below its Feb. 12 closing high.
Jake Dollarhide, chief executive officer of Longbow Asset Management in Tulsa, Oklahoma, said his firm in recent days has bought shares in a handful of growth companies whose prices have been pummeled in the recent selloff.
""Next week, I would expect volatility to continue, with pockets of opportunity, with certain things that sold off potentially rebounding,"" Dollarhide said.
Unofficially, the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 1.86% to end at 31,497.94 points, while the S&P 500 .SPX gained 1.95% to 3,841.78.

2021-03-05 00:00:00+00:00,These 2 Tech Giants Pulled the Nasdaq Back From the Brink Friday,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/these-2-tech-giants-pulled-the-nasdaq-back-from-the-brink-friday-2021-03-05,,,"This week has been a brutal one for the stock market broadly, and it's been especially painful for investors in the Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC). Many Nasdaq stocks have found themselves at the epicenter of a vicious market rotation away from cutting-edge innovative technology stocks toward older-economy companies, and it looked like the index would suffer more losses early in the trading session. But stocks regained their footing, and by 2:30 p.m. EST, the Nasdaq was up more than 1%.
Even so, many of the high-growth stocks that led the Nasdaq higher in 2020 still had to deal with losses. Instead, some of the recent laggards in the Nasdaq were notable gainers on Friday. In particular, both Cisco Systems (NASDAQ: CSCO) and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) rose substantially, helping to pull the overall index higher.
Don't count the old folks out just yet
It wasn't too long ago that many investors were just about to say that older tech companies like Cisco and Intel simply didn't have very good prospects for future stock performance. Popular innovation-focused investor Cathie Wood, who managed the ARK Invest family of funds to triple-digit percentage returns in 2020, singled out Intel as having lost its way as other microprocessor chip manufacturers passed its technology by. Meanwhile, Cisco had posted relatively weak results in recent weeks, with its core network infrastructure business slowed by pandemic-related issues.

Moreover, both Cisco and Intel faced huge competitive pressures. For Cisco, the dominance of Zoom Video Communications (NASDAQ: ZM) and its video-conferencing platform showed just how badly Cisco had failed to execute on a huge opportunity with its Webex software. Smaller, nimbler companies were also finding ways to beat Cisco on the networking front. Similarly, both Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) and NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) have come a long way toward dethroning Intel from its once-impregnable status atop the chip industry.
Looking up
But these tech giants got some favorable news that lifted shareholders' spirits. For Cisco, a favorable call from stock analysts at J.P. Morgan was just what the doctor ordered. The Wall Street financial stalwart upgraded Cisco stock from neutral to overweight and boosted its price target by 10% to $55 per share. Analysts believe that Cisco's shares are cheaply priced, and the tech giant is working hard to make a larger transition toward subscription-based services to generate recurring revenue. The just-completed acquisition of Acacia Communications should also put Cisco in a better position to compete in the fast-growing optical communications industry as well.
Intel climbed in unison with most semiconductor stocks on Friday. The ongoing shortage of chips has given chipmakers a big push, and even considering Intel's challenges, investors like the supply and demand tailwinds that the industry is giving the company right now. The valuation also looks more favorable than that of some competing stocks.
Be prepared for ongoing volatility
At times today, it looked as though the Nasdaq would be prone to a large correction or even a crash. However, even with a number of volatile high-growth companies, the Nasdaq also has some solid stalwarts that are ready to provide some reassurance even in the toughest of times.

2021-03-05 00:00:00+00:00,Is Qualcomm Stock a Buy?,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/is-qualcomm-stock-a-buy-2021-03-05,,,"Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM) stock has corrected significantly, falling by about 20% over the previous month. However, bulls seem to ignore Qualcomm's near-ideal market position in the smartphone chipset market, an industry on track for massive growth. This possibility alone gives investors good reason to treat the post-earnings sell-off in this chip stock as a buying opportunity.
The underappreciated bull story
Qualcomm's chipsets act as the ""brain"" of a smartphone, receiving and carrying out essential commands. For now, most smartphone manufacturers depend on Qualcomm's chipsets, technology that Qualcomm licenses to other manufacturers.
This has become particularly important amid the rising popularity of the 5G devices. Whereas the previous 4G standard brought speeds of between 12-36 megabytes per second (Mbps), 5G speeds commonly reach 300 Mbps and beyond.
Image source: Getty Images
Although the government once declared Qualcomm a monopoly, the company's attorneys persuaded an appeals court to overturn the decision. Moreover, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), who pursued lawsuits against Qualcomm for years over royalty costs related to the chipsets, dropped its legal challenge in 2019 amid the emergence of 5G. Instead, Apple bought Intel's smartphone chipset business, presumably hoping to develop a competing chipset.
Now, all major smartphone manufacturers produce 5G devices. Consequently, Grand View Research estimates a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) for the industry of 63% through 2027.
Companies such as Samsung and Taiwan-based MediaTek produce 5G chipsets. Still, Samsung's chip only goes into its phones, and MediaTek has only gained a following with lesser-known Asian manufacturers. For this reason, Qualcomm will probably claim most of this growth for the foreseeable future.
Qualcomm's latest earnings figures seem to reflect that dominance. In fiscal 2020, the pandemic's effects early in the year dragged down the company's full-year performance; revenue fell about 3% for the year, while net income grew a modest 18%. But the company seemed to recover robustly by the end of that year. In Q4 2020, GAAP revenue rose by 73%, while net income increased 485% year over year. And in Q1 2021, the most recent quarter, revenue and GAAP net income increased 62% and 165% year over year.
Effects on Qualcomm stock
Investors have noticed those rising revenues and earnings; Qualcomm stock has surged by just over 60% over the last year. Still, this also accounts for the recent correction that sent Qualcomm falling over the previous few weeks.
QCOM data by YCharts
Following the Feb. 3 earnings report, investors dumped Qualcomm shares, citing what was at the time a nearly 90% increase in the stock over the previous 12 months and concerns over a chip shortage.
However, the recent decline has further discounted Qualcomm stock. Now, the stock trades at 22 times earnings, down from a 28 P/E ratio before the earnings announcement. Hence, not only do new investors pay less than the current S&P 500 average P/E ratio of about 38, but they also benefit from massive revenue and earnings growth.
On top of the fast-growing profits, investors will receive $2.60 per share in dividends every year. Though that amounts to a yield of only 2%, Qualcomm's annual payout has risen every year since dividend payments began in 2003.
Also, the company can afford this payout. In fiscal 2020, $4.4 billion in free cash flow covered the $2.9 billion dividend expense for that year.
Additionally, while the $15.7 billion in combined short and long-term debt represents a significant burden, the remaining free cash flow also covered interest expenses of about $600 million. This means that although debt levels changed little over the last 12 months, those obligations pose no obvious danger to the company's stability.
The likely direction of Qualcomm stock
Even considering its potential issues, investors appear to have a buying opportunity in Qualcomm stock. Yes, the stock price experienced massive gains in 2020, and perhaps the time had come for a correction. Moreover, chip shortages and the possibility of competition remain ongoing threats.
However, in the end, new investors will pay 22 times earnings for up to triple-digit earnings growth. Moreover, unless and until a competing chipset hits the market on a larger scale, the 60%-plus of forecasted industry growth will primarily accrue to Qualcomm. Given the tremendous possibilities for increasing profits and its low valuation, Qualcomm's potential returns appear to significantly outweigh its risks.

2021-03-03 00:00:00+00:00,4 Reasons to Consider Buying ASML Stock,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/4-reasons-to-consider-buying-asml-stock-2021-03-03,,,"ASML Holding (NASDAQ: ASML), the world's largest supplier of lithography systems for the semiconductor industry, might not be a familiar name to many investors. But the Dutch company's stock has roughly doubled over the past 12 months, and it could still have room to run, for four simple reasons.
1. It's an essential supply chain player
Lithography systems use light to print circuit patterns onto silicon wafers. ASML controls nearly 90% of this market, and its top customers include Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM), Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), and Samsung.
ASML spent the past two decades developing its latest EUV (extreme ultraviolet) lithography machines, which are now being used to develop the world's smallest and most advanced chips. TSMC, for example, produced Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL) newest 5nm chips with ASML's EUV machines.
Image source: ASML.
2. The semiconductor market is benefiting from secular growth
The semiconductor market is cyclical, but its troughs could become shallower and its peaks could climb higher as the secular growth of newer markets -- including 5G networks, cloud and AI services, connected cars, and automated homes and factories -- generates fresh demand for more chips.
The global semiconductor market grew 5.4% in 2020, according to IDC, and could grow another 7.7% to $476 billion in 2021. The firm expects new 5G phones, expanding cloud services, and the post-pandemic recoveries of the auto and industrial sectors to drive that acceleration.
TSMC, which accounted for 31% of ASML's revenue in 2020, plans to increase its capex from $17.2 billion in 2020 to up to $28 billion in 2021 to keep pace with that demand. Samsung and South Korea's other chipmakers are also expected to boost their average capex by more than 20% this year. In short, demand for ASML's high-end lithography systems won't cool off anytime soon.
3. ASML has a history of generating robust revenue and earnings growth
ASML's revenue rose 18% to 13.98 billion euros ($16.89 billion) in 2020. It shipped its 100th EUV system during the fourth quarter, and 26 million wafers were exposed to its EUV machines at the end of the year.
Image source: ASML.
EUV systems, which cost much more than ASML's other lithography systems, accounted for just 8% of its total system shipments in 2020 but generated 43% of its total system revenue.
The EUV segment's revenue surged 59% in 2020, marking an acceleration from its 49% growth in 2019, and should continue growing as TSMC, Samsung, Intel, and other top foundries ramp up their spending to produce smaller and more powerful chips.
In late 2018, ASML predicted its annual revenue would land somewhere between 15 billion euros and 24 billion euros (between $18 billion and $29 billion) by 2025. It plans to update that forecast during its next investor day in June, but the rising capex at the world's top foundries, the recent shortage in automotive chips, and the crucial role of semiconductors in the tech war between the U.S. and China all indicate ASML will narrow its guidance toward the high end instead of the low end.
ASML's gross margin rose from 44.7% in 2019 to 48.6% in 2020, and it expects that expansion to continue as it ships more EUV systems. Its net income jumped 37% to 3.55 billion euros ($4.29 billion).
4. Years of strong growth are projected and the stock is reasonably priced
Analysts expect ASML's revenue and earnings to rise 33% and 40%, respectively, this year, led by surging demand from the 5G, high-end computing, and rebounding memory markets. That would put its revenue at 18.59 billion euros ($22.45 billion) -- which is already well above the low end of its target for 2025.
Wall Street expects ASML's revenue and earnings to rise another 11% and 18%, respectively, in fiscal 2022. Assuming it generates at least 10% top-line growth over the following three years, ASML's annual revenue could easily hit 27.5 billion euros ($33.1 billion) in 2025.
ASML's earnings should keep pace with its revenue as it sells more higher-margin EUV systems and continues its ongoing buybacks. It could also pump more of its excess cash into its dividend since its forward yield of 0.5% is easily supported by its low payout ratio of 30%.
Based on these estimates, ASML trades at 40 times forward earnings. The stock isn't a bargain, but its dominance of the lithography market and the secular growth of the semiconductor market arguably justify that slight premium. Simply put, investors looking for an alternative way to profit from the soaring demand for semiconductors worldwide should consider buying his oft-overlooked stock.

2021-03-02 00:00:00+00:00,1 Reason Why You Should Buy the Dip in AMD Stock,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/1-reason-why-you-should-buy-the-dip-in-amd-stock-2021-03-02,,,"Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) stock has stumbled out of the gate in 2021. Shares of the chip giant are down about 6% year to date, underperforming the broad market by a wide margin.
Data by YCharts.
That's surprising as AMD is about to deliver yet another year of outstanding growth. The company has been dominating Intel in the CPU market and is sitting on favorable trends in the GPU (graphics processing unit) space where demand is substantially outpacing supply. It could also win big in server processors.
However, these are not the only catalysts for AMD in 2021. The arrival of a new generation of gaming consoles from Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Sony (NYSE: SNE) is also turning out to be a major tailwind for the company -- one that could help the chipmaker exceed its own expectations as it supplies chips for both devices.
The new gaming consoles are witnessing unprecedented demand
The PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X consoles have been setting the sales charts on fire in recent months. The PS5, for instance, sold 4.5 million units in less than 50 days since its launch on Nov. 12, according to Sony's fiscal 2020 third-quarter report.
The company expects its PS5 console to break the record of its predecessor and to exceed sales of 7.6 million units by the end of March. That would be slightly higher than the 7.5 million PS4 units Sony sold from Nov. 2013 through Mar. 2014. According to another estimate, Sony might ship as many as eight million new consoles by the end of this month, though that would depend on the company's ability to procure more components amid a global shortage of chips.
The long-term picture also seems bright. The PS5 is expected to clock consistently strong sales in the coming years and may eventually top 200 million units shipped per third-party forecasts. The PlayStation 2 has been Sony's best-selling console to date with lifetime shipments of approximately 159 million units, while the PS4 has reportedly shipped around 115 million units. The PS5 has a real shot at dethroning its predecessor in the long run as there are millions of console users in an upgrade window.
Microsoft's Xbox Series X, on the other hand, is also witnessing strong early demand. Niko Partners estimates that Microsoft moved 3.5 million units of its new console in November and December of last year. The firm points out that the figure would have been higher had Microsoft not underestimated demand and produced more consoles. Management says the new Xbox is likely to be in short supply until July this year with the company reportedly selling out every console that it made last quarter.
All of this indicates that the new gaming hardware is likely to remain in high demand, which bodes well for AMD's enterprise, embedded and semi-custom (EESC) business.

And that demand has created a massive tailwind for AMD
AMD's EESC revenue shot up 176% year over year in the fourth quarter to $1.28 billion (the segment had delivered recorded just 7% revenue growth in the prior-year period). AMD management credited a ramp-up in the sales of semi-custom chips for this tremendous performance on the Jan. 26 earnings conference call:
Semi-custom sales increase year over year and sequentially based on strong demand for the next generation Sony and Microsoft consoles. Our semi-custom SoC sales are ramping faster than the last console cycle, and we expect sales to be better than typical seasonality in the first half of this year based on the current strong demand.
This indicates that the EESC business can continue to clock high growth rates in 2021, and that's great news for AMD as this segment produced 40% of total revenue last quarter. By comparison, the EESC business accounted for only 22% of the top line in the fourth quarter of 2019 when the new console cycle had yet to arrive.
Thanks to the rapid expansion of this business, as well as other growth drivers in CPUs and GPUs, analysts covering AMD stock have increased their earnings estimates significantly in the past month.
Data by YCharts.
At the same time, the stock has become cheaper because of its pullback. AMD is now trading at 42 times trailing earnings, way below the 2020 average earnings multiple of over 120. This should make AMD very attractive to growth investors as it aims to deliver 37% revenue growth in 2021 after last year's 45% increase.

2021-03-01 00:00:00+00:00,AI chip firm Wave Computing emerges from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/ai-chip-firm-wave-computing-emerges-from-chapter-11-bankruptcy-protection-2021-03-01,,,"By Jane Lanhee Lee
OAKLAND, Calif., March 1 (Reuters) - Artificial intelligence chip designer Wave Computing Inc said on Monday it has emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection following an auction of the company and will rebrand the firm as MIPS.
The company traces its origins back to MIPS Computer Systems Inc, cofounded more than 35 years ago by Stanford University professor John Hennessy, who is now chairman of Alphabet Inc GOOGL.O. MIPS was the commercial home of an earlier academic effort to create an architecture for computer processors that remain in wide use today by firms such as Intel Corp's INTC.O Mobileye self-driving car unit.
Wave Computing filed for bankruptcy in April. It was revealed by bankruptcy filings and Reuters reporting that in late 2018 and 2019, the company licensed its core computing architecture for use in China, Hong Kong and Macau to a Shanghai-based firm, CIP United Co Ltd, in a complex series of transactions. The transactions occurred just as a chip war was escalating between the United States and China, which could have made it more difficult for Chinese firms to use MIPS's technology.
According to two sources, CIP has kept the scope of that license even as the company emerges from bankruptcy. CIP was not immediately available for comment. Wave Computing was not immediately able for comment on the CIP license.
Wave Computing said Tallwood Venture Capital won the auction with a bid valued at $61 million and has sole ownership of the company. It also said two previous Chinese investors, Alibaba Investment Limited and venture capital fund Canyon Bridge Fund I, are no longer shareholders. The former is the investment arm of China's Alibaba Group Holding Ltd 9988.HK.
Wave Computing also said it will further develop its chip architecture based on the open source RISC-V architecture, which has attracted attention from Chinese companies who see it as a path forward for China’s chip independence as it is not controlled by any company or government.

2021-02-28 00:00:00+00:00,Better Buy: Micron Technology vs. Western Digital,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/better-buy%3A-micron-technology-vs.-western-digital-2021-02-28,,,"Micron Technology (NASDAQ: MU) and Western Digital (NASDAQ: WDC) are both major players in the memory and data storage market. Micron mainly sells DRAM and NAND (flash) memory chips, while WD produces NAND chips, flash-based SSDs (solid-state drives), and traditional platter-based HDDs (hard disk drives).
Both companies struggled with declining memory chip prices throughout 2019, as sluggish shipments to smartphone and PC makers caused a global glut of chips. DRAM and NAND prices gradually stabilized in 2020, but that recovery was throttled by pandemic-related disruptions in the first half of the year.
However, investors have been much more bullish on Micron than WD over the past 12 months. Micron's stock price rallied more than 50% as its memory chip sales improved, while WD's stock price remained nearly flat as its weak HDD business largely offset the growth of its NAND business. Will Micron remain a stronger investment than WD throughout the rest of the year?
Image source: Getty Images.
The key differences between Micron and WD
Micron generated 70% of its revenue from DRAM chips, another 27% from NAND chips, and the rest from other types of memory last quarter. That business model makes it the only ""pure play"" on memory chips in the U.S. market.
WD, which significantly expanded its NAND business by acquiring SanDisk in 2016, generated 52% of its revenue from flash products last quarter. The remaining 48% came from its legacy HDD business.
WD's HDD business has been shrinking as more PC makers have shifted to SSDs, which are pricier but also smaller, faster, more power-efficient, and less prone to damage than platter-based drives. It's trying to counter that secular shift by selling higher-capacity HDDs to enterprise and data center customers, but the segment's revenue and margin will likely continue to decline for the foreseeable future.
WD and Micron rank third and fifth, respectively, in the global NAND market, according to TrendForce's latest numbers. Samsung and Kioxia (formerly known as Toshiba Memory) rank first and second, respectively, and SK Hynix ranks fourth. However, SK Hynix will likely jump to third place after it closes its forthcoming takeover of Intel's (NASDAQ: INTC) NAND business.
In the HDD market, WD shares a near-duopoly with Seagate Technology (NASDAQ: STX), which hasn't aggressively followed its lead into the NAND market yet.
Which company is growing faster?
Micron's revenue declined 8% to $21.4 billion in fiscal 2020, which ended last September, as it grappled with low DRAM and NAND prices in the first half of the year. But its revenue rose in the second half of the year thanks to rising sales of PCs during the pandemic, the production of new 5G smartphones and gaming consoles, and robust orders from data center customers.
Those accelerating tailwinds boosted its revenue and adjusted earnings by 12% and 63%, respectively, in the first quarter of 2021. Its DRAM revenue jumped 17% year over year, and its NAND revenue grew 11%.
Micron expects DRAM and NAND prices to rise throughout 2021. Based on these catalysts, analysts expect its revenue and earnings to rise 17% and 47%, respectively, for the full year -- which are impressive growth rates for a stock that trades at just 11 times forward earnings.
Image source: Getty Images.
Western Digital's revenue rose 1% to $16.7 billion in fiscal 2020, which ended last July. However, its adjusted earnings plunged 37% as weak NAND prices crushed the flash unit's margins and its HDD margins continued to contract.
WD's fortunes didn't improve in the first half of fiscal 2021. Its revenue dipped 5% year over year to $7.9 billion during those six months, as its weak HDD business offset its rebounding flash revenue.
WD's HDD business struggled as weak demand from data center customers offset stronger demand from PC makers during the pandemic. The HDD segment's declining margins also partly offset its expanding flash margins.
However, WD's adjusted earnings still rose 40%, thanks to lower spending during the pandemic and an easy year-over-year comparison to the first half of 2020. Unfortunately, analysts expect its revenue and earnings to both decline about 4% for the full year before turning positive again in fiscal 2022.
WD's stock also trades at 11 times forward earnings, but it deserves that discount valuation a lot more than Micron. It also suspended its dividend last May, and probably won't reinstate those payments anytime soon. Micron hasn't paid a dividend since the 1990s.
The winner: Micron
I recently said Western Digital was a better investment than Intel since it has a clearer path to a turnaround than the struggling CPU maker.
But WD definitely isn't a better buy than Micron, which is recovering at a faster rate while trading at the same forward P/E ratio. Micron isn't as diversified as WD, but its streamlined exposure to the DRAM and NAND markets, along with its lack of a legacy HDD business, clearly make it a better overall investment.

Feb 26 (Reuters) - When President Joe Biden on Wednesday stood at a lectern holding a microchip and pledged to support $37 billion in federal subsidies for American semiconductor manufacturing, it marked a political breakthrough that happened much more quickly than industry insiders had expected.
For years, chip industry executives and U.S. government officials have been concerned about the slow drift of costly chip factories to Taiwan and Korea. While major American companies such as Qualcomm Inc QCOM.O and Nvidia Corp NVDA.O dominate their fields, they depend on factories abroad to build the chips they design.
As tensions with China heated up last year, U.S. lawmakers authorized manufacturing subsidies as part of an annual military spending bill due to concerns that depending on foreign factories for advanced chips posed national security risks. Yet funding for the subsidies was not guaranteed.
Then came the auto-chip crunch. Ford Motor Co F.N said a lack of chips could slash a fifth of its first-quarter production and General Motors Co GM.N cut output across North America.
""It brings home very clearly the message that the semiconductor is really a critical component in a lot of the end products we take for granted,"" said Mike Rosa, head of strategic and technical marketing for a group within semiconductor manufacturing toolmaker Applied Materials Inc AMAT.O that sells tools to automotive chip factories.
Within weeks, automakers joined chip companies calling for chip factory subsidies, and U.S. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and President Biden both pledged to fight for funding.
Industry backers now aim to be part of a package of legislation to counter China that Schumer hopes to bring to the Senate floor this spring. Still, all agree it will do little to solve the immediate auto-chip problem.
Headlines about idled car plants resonated with the public that had shrugged off abstract warnings in the past, said Jim Lewis, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Lawmakers, already worried that a promised infrastructure bill will not materialize this year, decided to push for quick solution.
""Nobody wants to be seen as soft on China. No one wants to tell the Ford workers in their district, 'Sorry, can't help,'"" ""It was one of those moments where everything aligned.""
The package includes matching funds for state and local chip-plant subsidies, a provision likely heat up competition among states including Texas and Arizona to host big new chip plants that can cost as much as $20 billion.
The subsidies could benefit a factory in Arizona proposed by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co 2330.TW and one in Texas eyed by Samsung Electronics Co Ltd 005930.KS, even though those factories would be geared toward high-end chips for smartphones and laptops, rather than simpler auto chips. And those factories would not come on line until 2023 or 2024, according to plans disclosed by the companies, the world's two largest chip manufacturers.
In the longer term, a raft of U.S. companies are also poised to benefit. Any chipmakers that build factories will source many tools from American companies such as Applied, Lam Research Corp LRCX.O and KLA Corp KLAC.O.
Intel Corp INTC.O, Micron Technology Inc MU.O and GlobalFoundries - which already have U.S. factory networks - will also likely benefit.
Smaller, specialty chip factories also could benefit.
“The recent chip shortage in the automotive industry has highlighted the need to strengthen the microelectronics supply chain in the U.S.,"" said Thomas Sonderman, chief executive of SkyWater Technology, a Minnesota-based chipmaker that makes automotive and defense chips. ""We believe that SkyWater is uniquely positioned due to our differentiated business model and status as a U.S.- owned and U.S.- operated pure play semiconductor contract manufacturer.""
Even with subsidies, the U.S. companies still must compete with low-cost Asian vendors over the long run, and the immediate auto chip troubles will probably persist.
Surya Iyer, a vice president at Minnesota-based Polar Semiconductor, which makes chips for automakers, said his factory is booked beyond capacity and has started speed some orders up while slowing others down, to meet automakers' needs as best it can.
""We are expecting this level of demand to continue at least for the next 12 months, maybe even longer,"" he said.

TEL AVIV, Feb 26 (Reuters) - Israel has led the world in COVID-19 vaccinations. Now it faces another challenge that other countries will have to grapple with: how to balance public health and the rights of the unvaccinated.
Its decisions will affect every walk of life - from schools to work, and culture to worship.
Half of Israelis have received their first shot, and the country began reopening its economy this week after a year of lockdowns and remote working.
But several activities have been deemed off-limits to the unvaccinated, angering those who cannot get the jab for health reasons, or refuse it as a matter of principle.
Some employers already plan to ban unvaccinated workers from the office, which rights groups fear could cost them their jobs. Unions have suggested workarounds, such as COVID-19 tests every 72 hours.
""I'm already at peace with the fact that I won't be invited to certain events or allowed into areas of entertainment,"" said Hila Bar, a business owner who is sceptical of medical science and does not plan to get vaccinated.
""So I won't go,"" she said. ""And I won't patronise certain businesses either - not because I don't want to, but they do not want my business.""
Israel, where the vaccine rollout is fast but not mandatory, is a world leader in inoculations. Other countries are likely to scrutinise its early experience to see how it addresses mostly unanswered questions about balancing individual rights with obligations to public health.
""Whoever does not get vaccinated will be left behind,"" Health Minister Yuli Edelstein warned in recent weeks.
Edelstein has made clear that newly introduced perks for the vaccinated - including access to theatres, gyms, and resort areas along the Dead Sea - are incentives to get inoculated.
But some advocates and employers are concerned that parliament has not passed any new laws regulating workers' return to offices or offering protections for the unvaccinated, saying it will force employers to devise their own rules.
Early discussions around guidelines and legislation point to employers, authorities and courts putting public health concerns before individuals' demands.
Intel's INTC.O Mobileye unit, in Jerusalem, says unvaccinated workers will not be allowed to come to the office as of April 4, but can work from home if their assignment allows.
The company estimates around 10% of its 1,500 employees will not get vaccinated. If they must come to the office, they will need to provide a negative PCR test taken within the prior 48 hours.
""It is our responsibility to make our offices a safe place – the greater good of our employees and their families trumps any other consideration,"" Chief Executive Amnon Shashua wrote to employees in an email seen by Reuters.
CIVIL RIGHTS
A landmark study released on Wednesday showed the Pfizer-BioNTech PFE.N, 22UAy.DE vaccine being used in Israel cut symptomatic cases among Israeli recipients by 94%.
But some officials privately estimate that 10% of Israelis over 16 - around 650,000 people - do not intend to get vaccinated.
Even asking employees to share their vaccine status could violate medical privacy rights, some advocates say, with potential ramifications for civil liberties that may eventually be challenged in Israeli courts.
""The question is how do we reopen the market, the economy, and life, without harming people that cannot or would not get vaccinated,"" said Sharon Abraham-Weiss, executive director of the Association for Civil Rights in Israel (ACRI).
""It's the vulnerable people, those that are not unionised, or temp (workers) or others who would bear the burden,"" she said, while calling for legislation.
Business leaders have also called for new laws. The health ministry did not comment when asked if legislation offering job protection to the unvaccinated was being drawn up.
Some large trade groups have begun drafting policy guidelines for members, including the Manufacturers Association of Israel, which represents 1,800 companies employing almost half a million workers.
The group's members are ""not chasing people in the street to stick some syringes in their shoulders and force them to vaccinate,"" though they are doing everything they can to encourage it, the group's president, Ron Tomer, said.
But according to a legal opinion commissioned by the group and reviewed by Reuters, members may ask employees if they were vaccinated as a ""safety measure"" to prevent infecting others rather than as a request for personal medical information.
Employers should take reasonable steps to allow unvaccinated staff to work from home or in separate bubbles, but those who cannot do so can be sent on unpaid leave, or, as a last resort, fired, the opinion says.
""If you don't want to take the injection, it's OK ... the employee (has a right) to protect his privacy. But on the other side there are rights of the public, the employers, the clients - the people that we give services (to),"" the opinion's author, prominent employment attorney Nachum Feinberg, told Reuters.
Offering a potential workaround, Israel's largest labour union, Histadrut, suggested that unvaccinated workers who cannot work at home present negative coronavirus tests to their employers every 72 hours.
'MATTER OF PUBLIC HEALTH'
Israel on Sunday launched a ""Green Pass"" system granting certain privileges to citizens who have had both doses of the vaccine or have recovered from COVID-19.
In one of its first real-life applications, only those carrying a government-validated certificate were allowed to attend a small open-air concert in Tel Aviv this week.
And parliament on Wednesday passed a law allowing the health ministry to give municipalities the names of residents who have not had a shot.
ACRI has opposed the legislation, arguing it violates privacy rights.
The law faculty at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem argued in a position paper that regulating vaccination ""is a matter of public health, and not a private medical issue"".
Existing Israeli laws grant the health ministry the legal authority to impose restrictions on the unvaccinated, and even to obligate vaccination in certain cases, the position paper says.
""Those who fulfil their obligation to vaccinate should not be asked to bear the cost of others choosing not to,"" said David Enoch, a professor in the philosophy of law at Hebrew University.

There are 24 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Intel Corp, but the average is just that — a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $40.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $86.00. The standard deviation is $12.302.
But the whole reason to look at the average INTC price target in the first place is to tap into a ""wisdom of crowds"" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with INTC crossing above that average target price of $63.17/share, investors in INTC have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $63.17 just one stop on the way to an even higher target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table? Below is a table showing the current thinking of the analysts that cover Intel Corp:

Feb 24 (Reuters) - Nvidia Corp NVDA.O forecast better-than-expected first-quarter revenue on Wednesday, betting on strong demand for its graphic chips used in gaming devices and data centers.
As people wait for vaccine rollouts, extended stay-at-home has sustained the demand for chips used in personal computers, gaming devices and data center infrastructure that enable remote working.
While Nvidia has been known for its graphic chips, its aggressive push in the data centers market has allowed it to become the most valuable semiconductor maker by market capitalization, eclipsing rivals Intel Corp INTC.O and Advanced Micro Devices AMD.O.
The company expects first-quarter revenue of $5.30 billion, plus or minus 2%, above analysts' average estimate of $4.51 billion.
Revenue in the quarter ended. Jan. 31 rose to $5 billion from $3.11 billion, a year earlier. Analysts on average were expecting it to be $4.82 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

2021-02-24 00:00:00+00:00,Air taxi startup Joby to go public in $6.6 billion blank-check deal,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/air-taxi-startup-joby-to-go-public-in-%246.6-billion-blank-check-deal-2021-02-24,,,"By Paul Lienert and Anirban Sen
Feb 24 (Reuters) - Joby Aviation, the 12-year-old electric air taxi startup partnered with Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T and Uber Technologies UBER.N, will go public in a $6.6 billion reverse merger with blank check company Reinvent Technology Partners RTP.N, the firms said on Wednesday.
California-based Joby aims to begin a commercial passenger service in 2024, using its electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft. Potential air taxi competitors include well-funded German startups Volocopter and Lilium.
Joby is being taken public via a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) headed by LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman, Zynga founder Mark Pincus and longtime investor Michael Thompson.
In an interview, Hoffman said: ""We did months of due diligence -- we got the same universal signal. These guys have got everything (to) redefine this new space . . . I think of Joby as Tesla meets Uber in the air.""
Joby is the first aerial vehicle startup to go public via the SPAC route. Reuters reported exclusively in January that Joby was exploring a deal to go public with a blank-check acquisition company.
Joby previously had received $800 million in venture funding, including a $620 million Series C round led by Toyota in early 2020 that valued the company at more than $2 billion, according to investor website Crunchbase. Early investors included JetBlue JBLU.O, Intel INTC.O and asset manager Baillie Gifford.
Toyota is working with Joby to design a California manufacturing facility for its four-passenger eVTOL aircraft, and is sharing access to its supplier network, Joby executives said.
""Toyota's involvement has really accelerated our manufacturing ramp -- they are the key to unlocking global scale for us,"" said JoeBen Bevirt, Joby CEO and founder.
Joby last year acquired Uber’s fledgling air taxi business, Uber Elevate. Uber will provide data to Joby’s aerial ride-sharing business.
""We want to tie together air and ground transportation to deliver the right customer experience,"" said Paul Sciarra, Joby executive chairman and co-founder of Pinterest.
Reinvent pulled in $835 million in PIPE investments from BlackRock, Fidelity and Baillie Gifford, which collectively have funded some of the top technology-driven transportation startups, including Tesla TSLA.O, Uber and Rivian.
The SPAC transaction will provide Joby with $1.6 billion in cash and is expected to close in the second quarter.
