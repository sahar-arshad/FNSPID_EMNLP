Peter Lynch Stock Ideas
About Peter Lynch: Perhaps the greatest mutual fund manager of all-time, Lynch guided Fidelity Investment's Magellan Fund to a 29.2 percent average annual return from 1977 until his retirement in 1990, almost doubling the S&P 500's 15.8 percent yearly return over that time. Lynch's common sense approach and quick wit made him one of the most quoted investors on Wall Street. (""Go for a business that any idiot can run -- because sooner or later, any idiot probably is going to run it,"" is one of his many pearls of wisdom.) Lynch's bestseller One Up on Wall Street is something of a ""stocks for the everyman/everywoman"", breaking his approach down into easy-to-understand concepts.

2021-04-30 00:00:00+00:00,Delivery Window for New Apple iPad Pro Shifts to June-July,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/delivery-window-for-new-apple-ipad-pro-shifts-to-june-july-2021-05-01,,,"Are you jazzed by the recent rollout of Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL) new iPad Pros and eager to get your hands on one? Well, you'll need to find some patience, as the availability of the snazzy tablets has been pushed back.
According to checks of Apple's website conducted by Bloomberg Friday morning, soon after putting them on sale, the company was indicating that initial U.S. deliveries of the products will occur from June 24 to July 8.
Image source: Getty Images.
Apple has not yet made an official statement or communicated with its customers about this. The company frequently takes some time to get new models into the hands of consumers; also, continuing chip shortages suffered by manufacturers around the world are a likely contributor to the situation.
The latest iPad Pro was rolled out, with the usual fanfare, during the company's ""Spring Loaded"" event in mid-April. The new tablet was one of the more ""wow"" products being introduced within the set of new offerings, not least because it contains the M1. This is the ultra-fast proprietary chip Apple has developed, and with which it is rapidly reducing its dependence on longtime supplier Intel.
While Apple has done a good job in boosting revenue from its services, it is still heavily dependent on sales of its famous products -- all told, the latter category comprised over 81% of its top line in the most recently reported quarter. Hardware sales are dominated by the iPhone, but the iPad has a good foothold -- sales of the tablets exceeded $7.8 billion during the period, up a very robust 79% year over year.
On Friday, Apple shares fell at a steeper rate than the overall market, declining 1.5% against the 0.7% dip of the S&P 500 index.

2021-04-30 00:00:00+00:00,7 Tech Stocks to Buy on Any Dip,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/7-tech-stocks-to-buy-on-any-dip-2021-04-30,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Historically, extreme speculation tends to correct sharply to the downside. Eventually, the market loses willing buyers at the top, causing the bubble to burst. Naturally, many have looked to tech stocks as the source for the next big collapse. Still, with the Nasdaq index recently hitting an all-time high, it’s not looking very encouraging for the bears.
But that doesn’t necessarily mean the bulls have an easy way up to new plateaus. As the Wall Street Journal reported, a day after the Nasdaq’s record-breaking run on April 26, tech stocks edged away. It wasn’t a catastrophic loss, mind you, and the sector could still ride on its jets. Nevertheless, some interesting factors could see a discount popping up in the technology space.
First, the old enemy of rising bond yields returned. As the key benchmark interest rate rises, it puts pressure on tech stocks, particularly because so many have enjoyed lofty premiums, perhaps too lofty. Since the risk of bag holding is more prominent today, investors seek to rotate out of risk-on names and into safer vehicles. When rates rise, government bonds look more attractive as a reliable source of passive income.
Second, a growing understanding has developed that valuations of tech stocks have been stretched further relative to other sectors. This notion become rather conspicuous when much-celebrated innovative firms released strong quarterly earnings results, only to see their equity units print red ink or respond very modestly.
10 of the Top Nasdaq Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy
Again, it’s not a guarantee that tech-related companies are due for a correction. Nevertheless, a dip wouldn’t be out of the realm of possibility. If so, you should consider these tech stocks as a discounted long-term buying opportunity.
IBM (NYSE:IBM)
Intel (NASDAQ:INTC)
Panasonic (OTCMKTS:PCRFY)
Bloom Energy (NYSE:BE)
FinVolution (NYSE:FINV)
Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU)
Palo Alto Networks (NYSE:PANW)
Despite the stretched valuations, we’re decidedly in the information age. Thus, if the technology sector suffers downside, it won’t be long before they start recovering due to their exceptional relevance. So keep these tech stocks on your radar: you just might get a tantalizing discount.
Tech Stocks: IBM (IBM)

An icon among tech stocks, IBM no doubt belongs among the pantheon of the sector’s greatest companies. However, this description has been more fitting of an inclusion in the history books as opposed to a contemporary investment thesis. This is a longwinded way of saying that analysts typically regard IBM stock as a boring play.
Nevertheless, the times could be changing. I recognize that I’ve been saying that for quite a while and it hasn’t panned out. And I don’t want to say those dreaded words of “this time, it’s different.” What I can say is that on a year-to-date basis, IBM stock is off to an auspicious start, gaining more than 15%.
Granted, that’s nothing compared to other high-powered tech stocks. But if you’re looking for a stable but relevant business, Big Blue might be it. Not too long ago, Gartner designated the company as a leader in two of its 2021 Magic Quadrant reports. This was thanks to IBM’s core competency in artificial intelligence.
I’m not sure when shares might go on discount, but you may want to add a position in this potentially resurgent under-the-radar company.
Intel (INTC)
Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com
In recent years, Intel made multiple glaring errors that clashed with its long-held image as a leader among tech stocks. Further compounding matters, the company watched frustratingly as rival Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) continued to reach plateau after plateau.
You can just look at the charts and see for yourself. Over the trailing five years, INTC stock gained 90%. That’s not bad but it’s nothing compared to AMD’s astounding 2,267% return over the same period.
In 2021, Intel appeared to be getting its mojo back, with INTC stock up more than 37% for the year at one point. Unfortunately, AMD again stole the tech firm’s thunder, delivering another strong quarterly result and forward guidance. Additionally, AMD enjoyed broad-based growth across nearly every product line, which translates to the company encroaching on Intel’s turf.

Naturally, this contributed to the recent decline in INTC stock. On the surface, the picture looks grim. Nevertheless, Intel’s forward-looking vision and ample acumen in innovation should not be overlooked. If you don’t mind taking some contrarian risks, INTC may be attractive after it’s done correcting.
Tech Stocks: Panasonic (PCRFY)

Once a forgotten entity among tech stocks when Japanese consumer electronics products lost their luster, Panasonic has enjoyed a resurgence with its specialty in batteries for electric vehicles. Should e;ectric vehicles take off – and that’s the general assumption – PCRFY stock could do very well, potentially expanding its battery offerings to several automakers.
Further, Panasonic may turn out to be the smarter bet in the EV space. Eventually, you’d figure that with so many competitors, we’ll soon see brand commoditization. Where companies will distinguish themselves is through battery technology and capacity. By then, Panasonic should have a sizable lead in research and development, boosting the case for PCRFY stock.
But another reason to consider the tech firm is its acquisition of U.S. supply chain software company Blue Yonder. In a deal worth $7.1 billion, Blue Yonder became extremely relevant due to the novel coronavirus pandemic’s global supply chain disruption.
Since it’s Panasonic’s biggest acquisition in a decade, investors have been skeptical. But that might make PCRFY one of the more interesting dips to advantage among tech stocks.
Bloom Energy (BE)

Near the beginning of this year, Bloom Energy was off to a great start. By Feb. 8, BE stock was up 56% and it was no wonder why. First and foremost, you had the election of President Joe Biden. His victory wasn’t just a reflection of the public’s desire for a change in leadership. In addition, Biden represented a new way of thinking regarding environmental sustainability.
Sadly, though, the Texas winter storm took a bite out of the clean energy thesis. Not helping matters were media pundits blasting renewable energy for the grid’s failure. Of course, the truth is much more complex than that but if you repeat something loud and long enough, it becomes true. Suddenly, BE stock finds itself up less than 2% YTD.
But perhaps the selloff is overdone. Undeterred from the volatility, Bloom Energy recently announced that “in collaboration with its Korean partner, SK Engineering & Construction Co., Ltd., an affiliate of SK Group, it has successfully deployed 100 kilowatts of solid-oxide fuel cells (SOFC) powered solely by hydrogen in Ulsan, South Korea, generating zero-carbon onsite electricity.”

If advanced societies hope to achieve net zero emissions, they must explore a variety of solutions. Bloom Energy is one to watch.
Tech Stocks: FinVolution (FINV)
Source: Shutterstock
One of the reasons why tech stocks that specialize in payment and financial services like PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) are so popular is because they provide alternative means to access capital. According to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, 5.4% (or 7.1 million) of U.S. households were unbanked in 2019. Likely, this figure will increase due to the Covid-19 crisis.
Now, you can acquire tech stocks that specialize in this field for the U.S. market. But for possibly greater gains, you may want to consider FinVolution. Billed as a “leading fintech platform in China connecting underserved individual borrowers with financial institutions,” FINV stock could become the next big fintech play.
Better yet, shares are not priced to the moon like other compelling tech stocks. Priced around $7, this has potential to catch fire with the social media crowd. Further, its financial performance backs up the hype. In 2020, it generated $986.3 million in revenue, up more than 42% from 2019 results.
Certainly, if you’re looking for a relevant, low-cost and long-term investment, FINV stock just might fit the bill.
Micron Technology (MU)
Source: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com
Over the last few days, chip manufacturer Micron Technology generated some weak numbers in its price chart. That’s not particularly surprising as the benchmark Nasdaq index has been slow over the same period. Nevertheless, the hesitant trading may be something that contrarian investors may want to advantage.
First, according to its latest fiscal second-quarter earnings report, the underlying DRAM (dynamic random-access memory) market is in severe shortage while the NAND sector appears to be stabilizing in the near term. This helped boost Q2 results above Micron’s original expectations due to much higher demand across multiple end markets.
Second, even without the dynamics resultant from the global chip shortage, Micron is forging a stronger footprint in two key markets: mobile MCPs (multichip packages) and automotive. According to management, Micron set revenue records for these two segments, boding well for MU stock once the global economy stabilizes.
10 of the Top Nasdaq Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy
Overall, the company delivered total revenue of $6.24 billion, up 30% from the year-ago quarter. Should MU still weaken from here, this is one of the tech stocks you’ll want to keep close tabs on.
Tech Stocks: Palo Alto Networks (PANW)
Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com
As companies rapidly scrambled to work-from-home platforms to address the Covid-19 crisis, Palo Alto Networks and similar publicly traded firms became one of the most obvious trades among tech stocks. Due to a wider footprint of access points, companies found themselves much more vulnerable to cyberattacks.
If there’s any overriding concerns that executives have about their employees clocking in from their living room, it’s vulnerability to cyber criminals. In a centralized location, you can better control your digital access points. When people are working from home, it’s a different story. Once an attacker gains access, they can wreak havoc on the network.
Thus, it’s not surprising that PANW stock enjoyed a strong performance over the trailing year. But will momentum carry forward now that coronavirus cases are declining in the U.S.?
Undoubtedly, some investors have been skeptical about PANW stock thanks to positive events like the vaccine rollout. However, late last year, CNBC reported that one in four Americans will still be working remotely in 2021. Therefore, I don’t think it’s out of the question that cybersecurity firms will hold onto their relevance.

2021-04-30 00:00:00+00:00,3 Exciting Biotech Stocks to Buy Right Now,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-exciting-biotech-stocks-to-buy-right-now-2021-04-30,,,"Although many think that DNA wasn't discovered until the 1950s, that was only when its three-dimensional double-helix structure was first recognized. The genetic molecule itself was first identified back in 1869. And today, some of the most exciting publicly traded biotech companies are capitalizing on our ever-growing ability to map and manipulate genes.
Intellia Therapeutics (NASDAQ: NTLA), Beam Therapeutics (NASDAQ: BEAM), and Twist Bioscience (NASDAQ: TWST) are all carving niches for themselves in that industry, adding to what we know about the human genome and using that knowledge in an attempt to fight some of the most stubborn diseases. And investors are paying attention -- all three stocks are up by more than 300% in the past year.
BEAM data by YCharts
Genetic medicine is a broad field, but ultimately it comes down to a relatively simple premise. The instructions for building all life on Earth are encoded in long chains of DNA, using just four nucleotides, or bases. The instructions in those chains are translated by our cells into RNA, which in turn tells our cells how to create proteins. Ultimately, it's these proteins that end up becoming the antibodies, enzymes, hormones, and other functional components that drive our biological processes. But along the way, a lot of things can go wrong. Due to mutations, errors in the code can creep in, causing some of those protein building blocks to be constructed incorrectly, or not at all.

1. Intellia Therapeutics
Prior to the pandemic, CRISPR/Cas9 was perhaps the most widely known technique associated with genetic medicine. The technique, which facilitates the cutting of DNA at precise locations, was discovered when bacteria were observed to cut snippets of genetic material from viruses and file them away, allowing those bacteria to ""remember"" the invaders the next time they came around. This bacterial defense mechanism is being commandeered to fight human diseases by knocking out unwelcome genes, repairing mutations, and inserting corrected, properly functioning sequences of DNA where they are needed.
Intellia is using the CRISPR/Cas9 technique in two ways: to perform gene editing directly in a patient to mitigate or cure an illness, and in the lab to engineer enhanced immune system cells or stem cells to fight cancers and autoimmune diseases. The most advanced gene-editing treatment in the company's pipeline is NTLA-2001, a candidate for treating transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTR), a rare condition that causes proteins to fold incorrectly. That treatment is being developed with Regeneron. NTLA-2001 is still in early stage clinical trials, but initial data from those studies is expected this year.
Intellia's treatment for sickle cell disease, which it is developing with partner Novartis, is the farthest along in terms of engineering a therapy outside the body. But it, too, is in early clinical trials, which are expected to be completed in 2023.
The company has about $600 million in cash and short-term investments on its balance sheet, and recently received funding from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. That cash cushion is important. Even if the company eventually delivers a treatment or treatments that lead to commercial success, that won't happen for a least a few years. For investors, therefore, owning Intellia stock requires a leap of faith.
2. Beam Therapeutics
Beam Therapeutics is using a less well-known approach called base-editing. This potential new genetic therapy changes individual bases within the DNA. If CRISPR/Cas9 can be thought of as a pair of scissors, base-editing is more like an eraser and pencil. The company's technique uses a chemical reaction to repair DNA mutations, restore proper function, and silence or reactivate gene expression.
Within its pipeline, Beam Therapeutics' treatment for sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia is farthest along, but it has not yet received approval to start human trials. That said, there's plenty of excitement around Beam Therapeutics' candidates. At the American Society of Hematology (ASH) conference in December, the company presented its two treatments for these blood disorders and demonstrated precise gene-editing with no off-target effects. That's important, because one of the biggest concerns about CRISPR/Cas9 has been that such treatments might unintentionally disrupt other parts of the genome. Management plans to submit an Investigational New Drug Application in the second half of this year.
3. Twist Bioscience
Unlike Intellia and Beam, Twist Bioscience isn't developing gene-based disease treatments itself. Instead, it's trying to industrialize biological engineering. Its core technology offers a way to manufacture synthetic DNA and encode it on a silicon chip instead of the traditional approach, which uses a 96-well plastic plate. That might seem unimpressive at first glance -- but consider the ramifications.
Image source: Getty Images.
The standard plate now used, roughly the size of a pack of index cards, holds one gene. Twist Bioscience's wafer contains nanowells, each containing 100 microscopic holes, and can produce about 10,000 different genes on a wafer set the same size as the traditional DNA synthesis machine. The dramatically scaled-down approach makes the process much cheaper and faster. CEO Emily Leproust compares her company's position to the one held by Intel in the early years of semiconductor manufacturing. Twist's platform has facilitated research in cancer, neuroscience, super-strong materials, biodegradable plastic, and energy. It might seem like a product with a limited market, but business is good.
Twist Bioscience's client base and its order volume have grown quickly, and management has identified both a near-term driver of sales and another that offers immense longer-term potential. For now, a focus on synthetic biology and genome sequencing customers offers a path to impressive growth. However, it's the drug-discovery market that could justify the Intel comparison.

Management believes its current market opportunity is about $1.8 billion, with about three-fourths of that coming from companies that are at this point creating their own synthesis supplies. The goal is to convert those makers into buyers.
With a market capitalization of nearly $7 billion, the company's stock isn't cheap. Its price-to-sales ratio is nearly five times what it was before the pandemic. That said, with awareness of gene-based medicines growing, and with billions of dollars being funneled into their research and development, it isn't hard to imagine a future where large-scale synthetic DNA manufacturing is a prerequisite for developing the next generation of blockbuster drugs. That should be an exciting thought for Twist Bioscience shareholders.

April 30 (Reuters) - Chipmaking equipment supplier BE Semiconductor (BESI) BESI.AS said on Friday it planned to boost its operations in the United States and Taiwan as its top customers ramp up investment to meet a surge in chip demand.
The Dutch-based maker of semiconductor assembly and packaging equipment also said it expected second-quarter revenue to rise between 30% and 40% from the previous quarter.
""At present, our strategic priorities focus primarily on ramping production to meet customer delivery dates,"" Chief Executive Richard Blickman said in a statement, citing favourable order trends.
Suppliers to the semiconductor industry have been benefiting from soaring demand from major chip manufacturers, such as TSMC 2330.TW and Intel INTC.O, which are expanding production to ease global semiconductor shortage caused by the coronavirus pandemic.
The squeeze came about as carmakers - recovering from factory shutdowns last year - compete against the sprawling consumer electronics industry for chip supplies, amid a pandemic-led surge in demand for phones, TVs and gaming consoles.
BESI reported first-quarter revenue at 143.2 million euros ($173.50 million), up 30.5% from the fourth quarter, but at the lower end of the company's guidance amid supply chain constraints.
The group added that the revenue increase was mainly driven by 5G products and a recovery in sales for automotive sector.

BERLIN, April 30 (Reuters) - The chip supply bottlenecks in German industry will likely worsen in the second quarter and lead to an overall weaker recovery of Europe's largest economy this year, the Bundesbank's chief economist told Reuters on Friday.
Shortages of semiconductors and other industrial components have led to production cuts in manufacturing, forcing executives and policymakers to rethink supply lines and try to reduce reliance on a handful of Asian and U.S. suppliers.
Automakers and electronics producers are being hit hard by delivery delays of chips, caused by factory closures during the first COVID-19 wave last year and a spike in demand for semiconductors in an increasingly digitised world.
""We expect the problem with semiconductor shortages to worsen somewhat in the second quarter. It could then normalize from the middle of the year,"" said Jens Ulbrich, chief economist of the German central bank, the Bundesbank.
Asked how much growth the bottlenecks would cost the German economy as a whole, Ulbrich said the negative impact was hard to quantify.
""We do see clear signs of slowing down in vehicle production in the first quarter. However, it is not possible to isolate the semiconductor effect, as various other factors also overlap with it,"" Ulbrich said.
He pointed to special factors related to Britain's exit from the European Union which led to pull-forward effects and increased production in the fourth quarter, which then resulted in a certain weakness at the beginning of the year.
""The sales tax increase also played a similar role. Ultimately, only the manufacturers can quantify the effect,"" Ulbrich said.
But there is no doubt that the chip bottlenecks and related production cuts will lead to weaker growth this year.
""The recovery will probably be a little less strong than without this specific semiconductor problem,"" Ulbrich said.
The Bundesbank expects nonetheless a relatively strong upswing from the middle of the year which will then also be supported by private consumption, he added.
The German government earlier this week lifted its economic growth forecast for this year to 3.5% from 3% previously, counting on a rebound of household spending once COVID-19 restrictions are lifted in the course of the summer.

2021-04-29 00:00:00+00:00,EU explores chipmaker alliance as alternative to foreign-funded megafab - sources,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/eu-explores-chipmaker-alliance-as-alternative-to-foreign-funded-megafab-sources-2021-04-29,,,"By Mathieu Rosemain, Michel Rose and Foo Yun Chee
PARIS/BRUSSELS, April 29 (Reuters) - The European Union is considering creating a semiconductor alliance including STMicroelectronics, NXP, Infineon and ASML to cut dependence on foreign chipmakers amid a global supply chain crunch, four EU officials said.
The plan, which is at a very preliminary stage, may include a pan-European scheme known as an Important Project of Common European Interest (IPCEI), which allows EU governments to pump in funding under easier state aid rules, and companies to work together on the entire project, the sources said.
It would complement or come as an alternative to a possible foreign-funded factory, with the aim to double the EU's market share in semiconductors to 20% by 2030, a target set out by European internal market chief Thierry Breton.
The EU Commissioner, who is seeking to persuade a leading chipmaker to site a major fabrication plant in the bloc, is due to meet Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger on Friday. He will also hold a video conference with Maria Marced, President of TSMC Europe.
Diplomats and Taiwanese officials say TSMC 2330.TW is not interested in building a plant in the EU.
However, several EU officials winced at the idea of foreign-funded megafab.
""Politicians like shiny things and sometimes tend to sacrifice long-term industrial policies for short-term announcements,"" a senior French official said.
""If we step on the toes of European players, then I'm not sure our sovereignty will gain anything from it,"" the source added.
Three EU Commission officials said they weren't happy with a strategy relying on non-EU companies to build factories and that partnerships between EU companies and foreign peers may work better.
There's also a big question mark over the capacity of the European internal market, which lacks a big smartphone industry, and whether it could absorb the additional output, the French official said.
Such disagreements cast a light on the struggles experienced by the European executive body in defining an industrial strategy for its semiconductor industry, which is dwarfed by its Asian competitors and doesn't have a champion with the financial firepower necessary to build a new plant.
They also underline the suspicion with which Breton, a French national and former chief executive of IT firm Atos, is met within the European Union, another official told Reuters. Talks of a strategic autonomy unnerve supporters of a free market, who see him as a protectionist, the source said.
Officials say talks are ongoing and there are no final decisions. Breton and EU tech chief Margrethe Vestager will present the Commission's updated industrial strategy, with the main focus on semiconductors, on May 5.
""To be leaders not followers, EU industry requires urgent, ambitious action on digital technologies such as semiconductors, cloud, quantum, space connectivity & batteries,"" the EU commissioner tweeted on Thursday following a meeting in Berlin with German Economy Minister Peter Altmaier.
Breton said at the meeting that 22 EU member states had agreed to support his initiative to support local production.
A spokesman for ASML ASML.AS, the world's leading producer of advanced chipmaking tools, confirmed the company has participated in the Breton-led talks.
""We're of course bringing the equipment manufacturers' view to the table,"" Sander Hofman said.
GlobalFoundries, which runs Europe's largest semiconductor foundry complex in Dresden, Germany, said: ""We stand in close contact with team Breton, the EU Commission, the German government and other key public authorities across Europe.”

2021-04-29 00:00:00+00:00,ANALYSIS-Chip shortages expose Achilles' heel of Germany's recovery,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/analysis-chip-shortages-expose-achilles-heel-of-germanys-recovery-2021-04-29,,,"By Michael Nienaber
BERLIN, April 29 (Reuters) - Germany has boomed on the back of globalisation, but now the worldwide web of supply chains that turbo-charged its economy could prove a critical weakness.
Shortages of semiconductors and other industrial components are threatening to derail the country's economic recovery, forcing executives and policymakers to re-think supply lines and try to reduce reliance on a handful of Asian and U.S. suppliers.
Automakers and electronics producers, in particular, are being hit hard by manufacturing delays of chips, caused by a global shortfall. This has become one of the biggest risks for Europe's largest economy, on top of a third wave of COVID-19.
The Ifo economic institute warned this week that the supply bottlenecks had become more widespread. The outlook is most precarious for the manufacturing sector, which generates about a quarter of economic output and is driving growth.
""The situation is very tense,"" said Eckehart Rotter, a spokesman for Germany's VDA automobile association, adding that the semiconductor problems affected car manufacturers and suppliers alike.
Due to the shortages of electronic components, in particular the microcontroller chips crucial to modern vehicles' functioning, production lines had to be stopped several times for several weeks due to delivery delays, Rotter said.
Volkswagen VOWG_p.DE and Daimler DAIGn.DE are among the companies that have been affected in the auto sector, the driving force of German manufacturing. Industrial giant Siemens SIEGn.DE is also struggling to get enough semiconductors.
The problem has forced many companies to announce short-time work and scale back production for the coming weeks, with the scarcity of components also expected to lead to higher end-prices for consumers and overall inflationary pressures.
The production cuts suggest that passenger car production in Europe will miss forecasts in the first half of the year.
""This affects highly integrated microprocessors as well as simple control elements,"" the VDA's Rotter said, adding that more than 1,000 of such components are needed in some vehicles.
""The extent to which this deficit can be made up in the second half of 2021 is currently still open. The situation remains critical.""
SEMICONDUCTOR 'SOVEREIGNTY'
The global chip shortage stems from a combination of factors including fallout from last year's COVID-19 shutdowns and factories struggling to meet demand for semiconductors which have become omnipresent in an increasingly digitised world.
Automakers and suppliers rely almost exclusively on chips from a few manufacturers, so-called foundries. They include Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC), South Korea's Samsung Electronics Co Ltd 005930.KS, GlobalFoundries, United Microelectronics Corp 2303.TW and SMIC whose production sites are located mainly in Taiwan, South Korea, China and the USA.
""There is hardly any other economy which has benefited as much from globalisation in recent years as Germany,"" said Iris Ploeger, a board member of the BDI industry association. But she acknowledged the chip shortages had exposed this reliance on overseas suppliers as an Achilles' heel of Deutschland AG.
While VDA and BDI are not questioning the importance of free trade and open markets, both call on companies to address the downside risks of globalisation and diversify supply chains.
And this means bringing back factories to Germany or at least to the European Union's single market, they say.
""When it comes to chip design, Europe is dangerously dependent on other regions,"" Ploeger said, adding European industry had to regain lost skills with government support.
""European sovereignty for semiconductors is important in order to be able to react more flexibly to disruptions in supply chains and to changes in consumption patterns.""
CHIP SHORTAGES INTO 2022?
Since global semiconductor production capacities are fully utilized, a significant short-term expansion of production is not on the cards and some analysts forecasts the shortages could last into next year.
""In the medium to long term, it's also in Europe's interest to increasingly localize these technologies in Europe,"" the VDA's Rotter said. ""But that takes time and does not solve the current bottleneck problem.""
Further complicating the economics of such re-locating steps is the problem that the German car industry's share in the global semiconductor market itself is too small for a complete and profitable in-house production, he added.
In alliance with the European Union's executive, German Economy Minister Peter Altmaier and French counterpart Bruno Le Maire are planning to pour billions of euros into state aid schemes to support the construction of local chip factories and development of next-generation semiconductors.
As parts of the efforts, the European Commission last month launched a 10-year plan, setting its sights on a 20% global semiconductor market share and building a fabrication plant that can make superfast 2 nanometer chips.
On Friday, European Commission Thierry Breton will meet the chief executive of chipmaker Intel INTC.O and a top executive of Taiwanese competitor TSMC as the EU seeks to shield the bloc from future shocks in the global supply chain.
Breton is seeking to persuade a leading chipmaker to site a major fabrication plant in the EU that would help realise the Commission's strategic goal of securing the most advanced chip production technology over the next decade.

2021-04-28 00:00:00+00:00,5 Reasons to Avoid Intel After Its Q1 Earnings Report,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/5-reasons-to-avoid-intel-after-its-q1-earnings-report-2021-04-28,,,"Intel's (NASDAQ: INTC) stock recently tumbled after the chipmaker posted its first-quarter earnings. Its revenue fell 1% year over year to $19.7 billion, but still beat estimates by $1.75 billion.
Its non-GAAP net income declined 6% to $5.7 billion. Its non-GAAP earnings per share, buoyed by buybacks, dipped 1% to $1.39 and cleared expectations by $0.25. Those numbers exclude its NAND business, which will be sold to SK Hynix, and other one-time items.
Intel expects its revenue and non-GAAP earnings to decline 10% and 15% year over year, respectively, in the second quarter. Analysts had expected its revenue and earnings to fall 9% and 19%, respectively.
Image source: Getty Images.
For the full year, Intel expects its GAAP revenue to dip 1% to $77 billion, and for its non-GAAP revenue to drop 7% to $72.5 billion, which misses the consensus forecast of $72.8 billion. It expects its non-GAAP EPS to decline 13%, compared to gloomier forecasts for a 19% decline.
Intel's first-quarter growth cleared Wall Street's low bar, but its mixed guidance indicated its troubles would persist throughout the year. Intel's stock might look cheap at 13 times forward earnings with a decent forward yield of 2.4%, but it's still not worth buying for five simple reasons.
1. PC sales will decelerate after the pandemic ends
Intel's Client Computing Group (CCG) revenue rose 8% year over year to $10.6 billion during the quarter as it sold more CPUs for PCs. Its total PC unit volumes increased 38% year over year, with a 54% jump in notebook volumes offsetting a 4% decline in desktop volumes.
However, PC sales mainly rose because the pandemic caused more people to buy new systems for remote work, online education, and gaming. That tailwind should fade after the pandemic ends.
2. It could lose more market share to AMD
Intel's ongoing chip shortage, which started in 2018 and hasn't been resolved yet, caused many PC makers to buy more chips from its fabless rival AMD (NASDAQ: AMD), which outsources its chip production to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) instead of manufacturing its chips internally.
As a result, Intel ceded the desktop and notebook CPU markets to AMD over the past three years.

71.3%
51.9%

77.8%
AMD (Desktops)
28.7%
48.1%
AMD (Notebooks)
8.7%
22.1%
Data source: PassMark Software.
Those declines could continue for the foreseeable future as the pandemic-related tailwinds dissipate and AMD moves further ahead in the ""process race"" to create smaller and more powerful chips with TSMC.
3. Existential threats in the data center market
Cloud capex soared across the world over the past year as data centers upgraded their hardware to cope with more online activities throughout the pandemic.
For example, the three largest hyper-cloud companies -- Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet's Google -- collectively boosted their capex 32% in 2020. That increased spending should be good news for Intel, which holds a near-monopoly in data center CPUs.
Yet Intel's data center group (DCG) revenue declined 20% year over year to $5.6 billion during the first quarter. It blamed that contraction on a ""challenging"" comparison to its 43% growth a year ago, which benefited from upgrades across the cloud, enterprise, government, and communication sectors.
But those challenging comparisons could persist throughout 2021 as cloud and data center customers prioritize purchases of other chips, such as NVIDIA's (NASDAQ: NVDA) high-end GPUs for crunching AI tasks, over Intel's flagship Xeon CPUs. NVIDIA's recent launch of its own data center CPU and its planned takeover of Arm could exacerbate that pressure.
4. Unclear plans for its own foundry
To resolve its ongoing production issues, Intel will outsource the production of some of its chips to TSMC. But it also plans to accept third-party chip orders at its new Intel Foundry Services division.
This strategy contradicts itself. Intel still needs TSMC to produce some of its new chips because of the limitations of its existing foundries, yet it's building new plants to manufacture chips for other fabless chipmakers.
In other words, Intel would still be temporarily dependent on TSMC, which remains ahead in the process race, while trying to compete against TSMC and Samsung for orders of less advanced chips. The foundry services business will also likely generate lower-margin revenue than its CCG and DCG businesses.
5. Gross margin pressure and reduced buybacks
Lastly, Intel's adjusted gross margin -- which dropped 6.1 percentage points year over year to 58.4% during the first quarter -- could remain under pressure as its PC sales decelerate, its data center sales decline, and it expands its lower-margin foundry services business.
Intel also plans to reduce its buybacks to conserve more cash for its expansion efforts. That's a necessary measure, but it will throttle its EPS growth as its gross and operating margins contract.
The bottom line
Intel isn't doomed yet, but it's falling behind better-run chipmakers like AMD, NVIDIA, and TSMC. Intel's new CEO Pat Gelsinger claims 2021 will be a ""pivotal year"" for the company -- but I'd like to see it actually pivot before I can consider it a worthy investment.

2021-04-28 00:00:00+00:00,Is Vuzix a Top Augmented Reality Stock?,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/is-vuzix-a-top-augmented-reality-stock-2021-04-28,,,"Share prices of Vuzix (NASDAQ: VUZI), a developer of augmented reality devices, skyrocketed nearly 1,500% over the past 12 months as demand for its glasses and headsets surged throughout the pandemic.
That rally boosted Vuzix's market cap from about $50 million a year ago to over $1.4 billion. Is Vuzix still a good investment on the AR market, or is there far too much growth baked into its stock price already?
What the bulls will tell you about Vuzix
Vuzix went public in 2013, the same year Alphabet's (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google unveiled Google Glass. Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) bought 30% of Vuzix in 2015.
Image source: Vuzix.
Unlike Google, which initially promoted Google Glass to mainstream consumers, Vuzix targeted enterprise clients with its M-series glasses and manufactured AR glasses for OEM customers. It launched its consumer-facing Blade AR glasses, which can access Google Assistant and Amazon's Alexa, in 2019.
Vuzix's revenue has risen significantly over the past five years, and its growth accelerated last year as remote work in the enterprise and healthcare sectors spurred fresh demand for its M-series glasses.

Wall Street expects Vuzix's revenue to rise 88% in 2021. It isn't profitable yet, but its net loss narrowed from $26.5 million in 2019 to $17.9 million in 2020. Analysts expect its losses to narrow again this year.
Only about a quarter of Vuzix's shares are held by institutions, which suggests the company still hasn't impressed the big investors yet. But once that percentage rises, its stock could head much higher.
What the bears will tell you about Vuzix
Vuzix's growth seems promising, but investors should take analysts' estimates with a grain of salt for two reasons. First, only four Wall Street analysts currently cover Vuzix, meaning opinions might be less balanced than they are for other stocks that are scrutinized by dozens of analysts.
Second, those forecasts might not fully account for slower spending after the pandemic passes, or tougher competition in the nascent AR market.
Google relaunched Glass for enterprise users in 2017, Microsoft launched its second HoloLens headset in 2019, and Qualcomm recently launched an AR reference design that will let OEMs quickly produce glasses and headsets on their own.
Image source: Getty Images.
Amazon also launched a pair of Alexa-enabled smartglasses called the Echo Frames, while Apple and Facebook are also reportedly developing their own AR glasses.
All these heavyweight challengers could pull customers away from Vuzix. These larger companies can afford to sell their devices at lower margins to tether enterprise and mainstream customers to their software ecosystems.
Vuzix's stock also trades at about 65 times this year's sales, making it pricier than many of the market's highest-growth tech stocks. That frothy valuation could limit its upside potential and expose it to higher bond yields, which are sparking a rotation from growth to value stocks.
Vuzix also recently raised $97.8 million (before fees) with a new offering of 4.77 million shares priced at $20.50 per share. That move should significantly boost its cash and equivalents, which stood at just $36 million at the end of 2020 but will also make its stock even more expensive.
Lastly, Intel sold its entire stake in Vuzix earlier this year. Intel might have sold its shares as part of its retreat from the wearables and smartglasses market three years ago, but the sale further suggests Vuzix's upside potential remains limited at these frothy levels.
Is Vuzix a top augmented reality stock?
Vuzix faces a lot of challenges, but it's still the best ""pure play"" on the AR market right now. Its bigger rivals have deeper pockets, but their AR products will only generate a tiny sliver of their total revenue.
Vuzix doesn't need to go toe-to-toe with Amazon, Apple, or Facebook. It merely needs to secure a small slice of the broader AR market, which Grand View Research expects to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 43.8% between 2021 and 2028.
Vuzix's high valuations should prevent it from replicating its recent multibagger gains in the near future. Nonetheless, it remains one of the most promising and direct ways to invest in the growing AR market.

2021-04-28 00:00:00+00:00,Why NVIDIA's Data Center Move Should Give AMD and Intel Sleepless Nights,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-nvidias-data-center-move-should-give-amd-and-intel-sleepless-nights-2021-04-28,,,"NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) made a big move in data centers at its annual investor day in April by announcing the Grace CPU (central processing unit) -- a product that could add more fuel to the chipmaker's rapidly growing data center business.
Grace is NVIDIA's first data center CPU, which would mark its entry into a market dominated by Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) when it goes on sale in 2023. The company claims Grace can ""deliver 10x the performance of today's fastest servers on the most complex AI and high-performance computing workloads."" But the more important thing to note here is that it would add another dimension to NVIDIA's data center chip lineup, making it one of the best ways to play a fast-growing industry. Let's see why.

NVIDIA targets the data center accelerator market
Data center accelerators such as GPUs (graphics processing units), CPUs, ASICs (application-specific integrated circuits), FPGAs (field-programmable gate arrays), and DPUs (data processing units) are in massive demand.
According to a third-party report, the data center accelerator market could clock a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of nearly 47% through 2027. The market can generate nearly $98 billion in annual revenue at the end of the forecast period, driven by the growth of high-performance computing (HPC) and artificial intelligence workloads in the cloud.
NVIDIA has already been taking advantage of this market with its data center GPUs and recently stepped up its game in the market with a new offering in the form of data processing units (DPUs). Its chips have been in great demand thanks to their ability to accelerate intensive workloads such as AI, deep learning, and big data analytics. Industry website The Next Platform estimates that GPUs account for 90% to 95% of the overall computational power of the servers they are installed in, which explains the 124% growth in NVIDIA's data center revenue last fiscal year to $6.7 billion.
With the launch of its server CPUs, NVIDIA will be able to dive into a market that could hit $19 billion in revenue by 2023, according to rival Advanced Micro Devices' (NASDAQ: AMD) estimates. In fact, the server CPU opportunity is supposed to be substantially bigger than the data center GPU market that's expected to produce only $11 billion in revenue by 2023.
So, NVIDIA will substantially boost its addressable market with the launch of the Grace CPU. But will it be enough to claw away market share from established players such as Intel and AMD?
Why AMD and Intel need to be worried
Intel is the dominant player in the CPU market with a share of over 90%. However, it has been losing share to AMD since the launch of the EPYC processors in 2017. AMD has made yearly improvements to its EPYC server processors over the years, and they are now in their third generation.
The recently launched EPYC 7003 processors have been a hit with consumers. AMD forecasts that its server platform could end 2021 with 400 cloud instances (a virtual server in a cloud computing environment) as compared to 200 last year. The chipmaker also anticipates 100 new server original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) to deploy EPYC processors this year.
Not surprisingly, AMD has been consistently taking away server market share from Intel over the years as the latter fell behind the technology curve. Chipzilla is looking to catch up to AMD with its recently launched 10-nanometer (nm) Ice Lake SP data center CPUs. Intel will look to further reduce the technological gap with AMD by moving to the Sapphire Rapids architecture in the next two years.
NVIDIA, however, can turn this two-horse race into a three-party struggle. That's because NVIDIA already sells DGX and HGX server systems that are powered by multiple GPUs and utilize AMD or Intel's chips, giving it an existing ecosystem where it can showcase Grace. NVIDIA claims that using the Grace CPU instead of those from its rivals in its server systems would translate into 30 times higher aggregate bandwidth, and a tenfold jump in performance over the current DGX systems.
So, NVIDIA already has the platform to potentially upstage its rivals once Grace hits the market. If the chipmaker can deliver the performance jumps it is claiming, it won't be surprising to see it take market share away from Intel and AMD.
All of this should bode well for NVIDIA's data center business, which supplied 40% of its total revenue last year. The segment now has an additional growth engine that could help the chipmaker remain a top tech stock for a long time to come.

STOCKHOLM, April 28 (Reuters) - Automotive technology group Veoneer VNE.N reported a bigger-than-expected loss for the first quarter on Wednesday amid cost pressures from a global chip shortage, but stood by guidance for like-for-like sales growth of more than 25% this year.
Sweden-based Veoneer said operating losses eased to $104 million from $122 million in the year-ago quarter to come in short of a mean analysts' forecast for a loss of $82 million, according to Refinitiv data.
The maker of vision systems, radars and software for advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) was hit hard by the initial outbreak of pandemic more than a year ago. But car production has since broadly recovered while facing a shortage of electronic components, above all semiconductors.
The company, which competes with the likes of Aptiv APTV.N, Bosch, Continental CONG.DE and Mobileye INTC.O, said the chip shortage had resulted in extra costs in the quarter while it also contended with the lingering turbulence created by the pandemic.
""In conjunction with these developments the underlying demand for cars continues to be strong,"" Veoneer Chief Executive and Chairman Jan Carlson said in a statement.
""We anticipate that disruptions will continue during the second quarter and then gradually decrease,"" he added.
The Sweden-listed shares of Veoneer VNEsdb.ST fell 2.9% at 1113 GMT.

BENGALURU, April 28 (Reuters) - Global and Indian firms are flexing their industrial muscle to help the world's second biggest population battle coronavirus, coming to the rescue of a public health system buckling under the weight of surging infections and deaths.
Amazon.com AMZN.O, Intel INTC.O and Google, as well as Indian firms Tata Sons, Reliance Industries RELI.NS and JSW Steel JSTL.NS have pitched in with everything from airlifts of medical equipment and funding pledges to making medical oxygen.
""What we need is better planning with the recognition that government's capacity is limited and therefore requires private participation,"" said economist Madhura Swaminathan of the Indian Statistical Institute in Bengaluru.
Hospitals struggling with a massive second wave of infections are turning away patients as beds and oxygen supplies run out, and social media brim with desperate calls for help in finding supplies of oxygen and drugs such as remdesivir.
A record increase in deaths over the prior 24 hours carried India's toll past 200,000 on Wednesday, a situation that experts blame on lack of oxygen supplies and infrastructure challenges.
On Tuesday Amazon said it would ship 100 ICU ventilator units to India from the United States.
It had earlier worked with partners to airlift more than 8,000 oxygen concentrators and 500 ventilators from Singapore, relying on its massive global logistics network to hasten procurement, a spokeswoman said.
Google promised $18 million in new funding for India, including advertising support for public health campaigns.
India's largest steel maker by market value, JSW, has stopped making some of the construction raw material as it diverts resources to turning out liquid oxygen instead.
From April 21 to 23, JSW supplied 898 tonnes of oxygen each day from its plants, equivalent to about 13% of the combined daily demand for 6,785 tonnes of the life-saving gas in India's 20 worst-hit states.
JSW said it was building large COVID patient centres around its plants, so that they can be serviced via a pipeline.
Billionaire Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Industries RELI.NS tweaked manufacturing at its oil refineries to produce hundreds of tonnes of oxygen for hard-hit areas such as Maharashtra, India's richest and worst-hit state.
Tata Group, one of India's oldest conglomerates, imported 24 cryogenic containers to transport liquid oxygen, while its Tata Steel TISC.NS unit ramped up oxygen supply.
""The government single-handedly cannot deal with this crisis any more, it is very important that the corporate sector gets into motion,"" said Kunal Kundu, India economist at Societe Generale in Bengaluru.
""We need all the help we can get.""
Economist Swaminathan called for the scope of private sector contribution to be widened beyond the merely voluntary.
""Anybody who has surplus funds and equipment should step in to help,"" she added. ""In terms of logistics, beds, oxygen, hospitals, the private sector has to be asked to do its task as part of policy.""

Wang's comments come amid overtures from the EU to persuade a global chipmaker to build a major fabrication plant on EU territory that would help the European Commission achieve a strategic goal of securing the most advanced chip production technology over the next decade.
Speaking to reporters, Wang pointed to previous comments by TSMC - Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd's 2330.TWTSM.N - on its production base.
""TSMC has said repeatedly that the most advanced technology will definitely be (produced) mainly in Taiwan,"" she said. ""As for how Taiwan and the EU can cooperate, companies have their arrangements and considerations, and it can be further discussed.""
The European Commissioner responsible for the EU's internal market, Thierry Breton, is scheduled to hold discussions with the chief executive of U.S.-based Intel INTC.O and the president of TSMC's Europe division, Maria Marced, on Friday.
Sources in Brussels say Breton is keener to reel in TSMC, which is widely regarded as the undisputed industry leader and has a better command of the most advanced manufacturing processes.
TSMC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Breton's push for technology 'sovereignty' for the EU comes as a surge in demand for everything from consumer electronics to cars has disrupted global supply chains and exposed the continent's reliance on chips made in Asia.
Wang added that she had had no direct talks with the EU on the subject ""over the last week or two"".
""But in our talks with the EU, industrial cooperation has always been an important topic. It's not just limited to semiconductors, it's on broader industrial cooperation.""
TSMC has said it intends to keep the focus of its production in Taiwan, though also has major plants in China and announced plans last year to build its own $12 billion factory in the U.S. state of Arizona.

MEXICO CITY, April 27 (Reuters) - A global semiconductor chip shortage, which has hurt Mexico's auto industry, could improve but still not be fully resolved by the end of the year, said the head of Intel Corp's INTC.O Mexico unit, Santiago Cardona.
Intel in late March said it will greatly expand its advanced chip manufacturing capacity with plans to spend as much as $20 billion to build two factories in Arizona and open its factories to outside customers.
The move aims to tilt a technological balance of power back to the United States and Europe as government leaders on both continents have become concerned about the risks of a concentration of chipmaking in Taiwan given tensions with China.
""There is light at the end of the tunnel, in that by the end of this year (supply) will be more normal,"" Cardona said in an interview late on Monday. However, he pointed out that the Semiconductor Industry Association has said it expects the chip shortage will not be fully resolved by then.
Automakers including General Motors Co GM.N, Ford Motor Co F.N and Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T have cut production this year due to the shortage, which led Mexico's auto industry to drops of 12% in production and 14% in exports during the first quarter.
Major automakers and suppliers will press Congress again on Tuesday to address the shortage that has curtailed auto production around the world.
Automakers have warned the shortage could result in 1.3 million fewer vehicles built this year in the United States and disrupt some production for at least another six months.
Cardona said the investment in Intel's two new factories is fully funded by the firm, although he did not rule out receiving incentives.
""We did not ask for (U.S. government) help, though we recognize that if there were support or subsidies, it would help us to do this even faster,"" he said

Semiconductors, coronavirus crisis, shortage of global supply, a new law to strengthen the semiconductors industry. Life sometimes gets too complicated and business is no exception either. Who would’ve imagined the novel coronavirus pandemic disrupting the global economy in such myriad ways?
Take for example the recent global shortage of semiconductors, which caused severe problems for major auto manufacturers and led to production pauses.
The global semiconductor market has been negatively affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The U.S. semiconductor industry has nearly half the global market share and in 2019 global sales of semiconductors were estimated at $412.3 billion.
It is a very large market. Hard to ignore when it faces business problems, and it’s no wonder why the semiconductors industry is the top priority for the U.S. government.
CHIPS for America Act: Boosting Semiconductors Industry
The CHIPS for America Act (CHIPS stands for Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors) will support and increase the U.S. competitiveness in the sector. It is focused mainly on domestic semiconductor R&D and manufacturing:
“The bill establishes investments and incentives to support U.S. semiconductor manufacturing, research and development and supply chain security.
Specifically, the bill provides an income tax credit for semiconductor equipment or manufacturing facility investment through 2026. The bill also establishes a trust fund to be allocated upon reaching an agreement with foreign government partners to promote (1) consistency in policies related to microelectronics, (2) transparency in microelectronic supply chains, and (3) alignment in policies towards nonmarket economies.”
Back in March 2021, Reuters reported that the U.S Senate would pledge $30 billion in funding to boost the chipmaking sector.
In theory, this Act seems positive for the U.S. semiconductors industry. But in reality, there is a big issue, that several semiconductors stocks and companies will not like at all. The Act will make some sectors a priority, which will be very helpful for the companies in those sectors but would not be ideal for others.
The Biden Administration is focusing on strengthening the supply chains of key products, including semiconductor chips. And some sectors that may benefit include defense, public health and biological preparedness, energy and food production, large capacity batteries, active pharmaceutical ingredients and critical and strategic materials.
Recently major tech companies protested against this sector partiality. Some of the companies in this letter addressed to the Congress and White House officials include Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD), Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM) and Texas Instruments (NASDAQ: TXN).

7 Hot Stocks to Buy Because of Soaring Sales
3 Stocks That Could Actually Be Hurt By the CHIPS Act:
Microchip Technology (NASDAQ:MCHP)
Maxim Integrated Products (NASDAQ:MXIM)
Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS)
Let’s take a closer look.
Microchip Technology (MCHP)

Microchip Technology develops, manufactures and sells semiconductor products for a large variety of applications control applications in the U.S.A., Europe and Asia. The company offers both general purpose and specialized microcontrollers and embedded microprocessors for business sectors such as automotive, industrial, aerospace, office communication and computing applications.
The company has a current market capitalization of $41.61 billion. Sales in 2020 amid the pandemic were marginally affected, with a moderate decline of 1.41% to $5.27 billion compared to revenue of $5.35 billion in 2019. Research & Development costs reported in 2020 were $877.8 million while net income was $570.6 million.
As the CHIPS for America Act has a priority on Research & Development, that implies that any further increase in those costs for Microchip Technology could harm profitability and free cash flows if there are more capital expenditures. In 2020, net income surged to $570.6 million, an increase of 60.33% compared to the net income of $355.9 million in 2019.
Maxim Integrated Products

Maxim Integrated Products is an even smaller company than Microchip Technology. It has a market capitalization of $25.429 billion. Maxim Integrated Products designs, develops, manufactures and markets a wide range of linear and mixed-signal integrated circuits in the United States, China, Europe and internationally. The company also provides business solutions for the automotive, communications and data center, consumer and industrial markets.
For the past two years, there has been a decline in sales growth and the Research & Development costs remain rather stable at about $450 million per year for the past four years. The company saw its net income decline by 20.88% in 2020 to $654.69 million.

7 Hot Stocks to Buy Because of Soaring Sales
Again the percentage of Research & Development costs to net income is high and this implies that any increase in research and development costs could harm the profitability of the company and negatively affect operating margins and capital expenditures.
Skyworks Solutions (SWKS)

Skyworks Solutions has a market capitalization of $30.809 billion and is the second-largest company on this list. Together with its subsidiaries, Skyworks Solutions designs, develops, manufactures and markets proprietary semiconductor products in the United States, China, South Korea, Taiwan, Europe, the Middle East, Africa and the rest of Asia-Pacific.
The company provides its products for use in the aerospace, automotive, broadband, cellular infrastructure, connected home, entertainment/gaming, industrial, medical, military, smartphone, tablet and wearable markets.
Sales growth saw a minor decline of 0.62% in 2020 but Research and Development costs have been steadily rising for the past four years. In 2020, Research and Development costs were $464.1 million. That’s about 57% the company’s net income of $814.8 million reported in 2020. Plus, net income has declined for the past three consecutive years. EBIT after Unusual Expense has been falling for the past two consecutive years. Again, any increase in the Research and development costs will harm the profitability of the company.
All three of these semiconductor stocks and companies have two things in common. First, they all provide solutions to the automotive industry. Remember, the automotive industry was one of the main sectors that had a shortage in chips and complained to the U.S. Administration about it. Second, these companies are not the largest in the semiconductors industry and with the focus of the CHIPS Act on research and development, their profitability may be at high risk.

2021-04-27 00:00:00+00:00,6 Causes of the Global Semiconductor Shortage,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/6-causes-of-the-global-semiconductor-shortage-2021-04-27,,,"The global semiconductor shortage is causing headaches for many industries. Manufacturers of PCs, mobile devices, gaming consoles, vehicles, networking devices, and industrial machines are all scrambling to buy enough chips to use in their products amid surging demand for those same products.
Investors looking to navigate this situation and avoid a problematic stock trade would be smart to know what's going on. That starts with being familiar with the six root causes of this ongoing crisis.
1. Intel's big mistakes
Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), the world's largest manufacturer of x86 CPUs for PCs and data centers, suffered a chip shortage in 2018 after its troubled development of new 10nm chips impacted its production of 14nm chips. It hadn't resolved that shortage when it stumbled again last year by delaying the launch of its new 7nm chips. Intel's missteps caused more PC makers to buy AMD's (NASDAQ: AMD) CPUs, putting a strain on its supply.
Image source: Getty Images.
Unlike Intel, which manufactures its own chips with its internal foundry, AMD outsources the production of most of its chips to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM), the world's most advanced chip foundry. As a result, AMD's growth and market share gains applied more pressure to TSMC's plants prior to the pandemic.
2. Declining memory chip prices
Meanwhile, memory chip prices soared in 2017 and 2018, but declined in 2019 and 2020 amid sluggish demand from the PC and smartphone markets. In response, top DRAM and NAND chipmakers -- including Samsung, SK Hynix, and Micron Technology (NASDAQ: MU) -- curbed their output before the pandemic.
3. The COVID-19 crisis
In short, the market was already wobbly when the pandemic started last year. However, the pandemic temporarily disrupted semiconductor shipments as global demand for new mobile devices, PCs, and data center upgrades surged in response to remote work, online learning, and other stay-at-home trends.
Most chipmakers recovered from their initial disruptions, and TSMC stayed online because its most advanced plants in Taiwan weren't affected. Memory chipmakers also quickly ramped up their production again in response to that rising demand.
But the chip sector still couldn't satisfy the market's appetite for new chips. TSMC's fabs have already been running at over-100% utilization over the past 12 months, and it recently announced it would spend $100 billion over the next three years to expand its operations. Intel also recently warned that the global chip shortage could last two more years and would require ""immense"" investments to resolve.
4. Secular tailwinds
Global demand for chips has generally been cyclical over the past few decades. However, the secular growth of new technologies -- including cloud services, 5G networks, and AI services -- is feeding a ""super cycle"" of chip upgrades that could last much longer than a traditional cycle.
Image source: Getty Images.
Connected devices, such as smartphones and cars, require a growing number of chips. Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ: SWKS), which produces wireless chips for a wide range of industries, expects each 5G smartphone to use $25 worth of front-end chips, compared to $18 per 4G devices and just $8 per 3G device.
Skyworks also expects nearly three-quarters of all cars to ship with cellular connectivity by 2024. IHS and Deloitte estimate the costs of all electronic components in cars accounted for 45% of their costs in 2020, up from just 18% in 2000, and that ratio could keep rising.
Many chipmakers expected this supercycle to significantly boost their sales prior to the pandemic, but the crisis accelerated many of those trends while temporarily disrupting their shipments. That pressure will likely cause the global chip shortage to drag on.
5. The ongoing tech war
The tech war between the U.S. and China, which intensified under President Donald Trump and is continuing under President Joe Biden, is another pressing issue. The U.S. has already levied sanctions against several big Chinese companies, including SMIC and Huawei, amid national security concerns.
Those sanctions are exacerbating the shortage of advanced chips in China, but they're also spurring the Chinese government to aggressively invest in its domestic chipmakers to reduce its overall dependence on overseas technologies -- which could cause a messy decoupling of the U.S. and Chinese markets.
6. More challenges ahead
The Biden administration recently proposed spending $50 billion to strengthen America's chipmaking sector, but fresh cash probably won't resolve the current chip shortage.
That's because most of the global semiconductor market still relies on overseas companies like the Dutch semiconductor equipment maker ASML (NASDAQ: ASML), Taiwan's TSMC, and South Korea's Samsung -- which are all arguably more important than most American chipmakers.
Moreover, several recent setbacks -- including a power outage at TSMC, a production pause at Samsung, and a fire at the Japanese auto chipmaker Renesas -- all highlight the fragility of the semiconductor supply chain and its overwhelming dependence on overseas gatekeepers.
What does this shortage mean for investors?
As the semiconductor shortage continues, investors should buy shares of essential companies like ASML and TSMC -- which will profit from elevated demand for their products and services -- while avoiding chip-starved sectors like the auto industry. Investors should also stick with better-run fabless chipmakers like AMD and NVIDIA instead of Intel, which could still struggle with R&D and production issues for the foreseeable future.

2021-04-27 00:00:00+00:00,"Arm details new data center chips, says Oracle, Alibaba will use them",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/arm-details-new-data-center-chips-says-oracle-alibaba-will-use-them-2021-04-27,,,"By Stephen Nellis
April 27 (Reuters) - Arm Ltd, the British chip technology firm being acquired by Nvidia Corp NVDA.O in a $40 billion deal, on Tuesday gave new details about its next generation of data center technology and said Oracle Corp ORCL.N and Alibaba Group Holding 9988.HK will use the chips.
Arm creates underlying intellectual property that other firms such as Qualcomm Inc QCOM.O or Apple Inc AAPL.O then license to create their own processor chips. Arm's technology powers most mobile phones, but it is making a push into data center processors, where Intel Corp INTC.O and Advanced Micro Devices AMD.O have long dominated.
Analysts view Arm's data center efforts as the key reason that Nvidia, which also competes against Intel, sought to buy the firm. British officials have invoked a national security law to review the deal. NL8N2MC3LU
Arm said on Tuesday that its ""N2"" Neoverse computing cores are expected to be about 40% faster than the previous generation. The company also said that its ""V1"" cores - which are designed to handle a different type of math commonly used for artificial intelligence - are expected to be 50% faster than traditional methods of doing the same tasks.
Arm said that Marvell Technology Inc MRVL.O is making a chip using its new technology. It also said that Oracle will use Arm-based chips made by Ampere Computing in its growing cloud computing business, and that Chinese technology giant Alibaba is preparing to offer Arm-based cloud computing services, though the chip vendor was not disclosed.
The new cloud customers come after Intel for years controlled more than 90% of the market for data center chips. Chris Bergey, Arm's senior vice president and general manager for its infrastructure line of business, said that Arm's approach has been to license its technology to many different chip companies who are taking different approaches to winning business from cloud customers.
""We're all engineers here - there's different optimization points, there's different views"" Bergey told Reuters in an interview. ""I don't think anyone is saying Arm is not a viable alternative.""

The businesses in question are Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM), Nio (NYSE: NIO), and Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ: GILD). These companies are riding solid long-term structural tailwinds and have strong balance sheets that can enable them to capitalize on the opportunities. Besides, the three companies are currently trading at levels significantly below their all-time highs -- which is surprising considering the ongoing stock market rally.
Investors can earn attractive returns from any of these fundamentally strong stocks from an investment of as little as $1,000, provided this money is not needed to pay bills or as contingency funds.
Image Source: Getty Images.
1. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing
An exceptionally smart way to invest $1,000 right now would be to buy shares of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing.
The pandemic-related spike in demand for consumer electronics added to the already elevated chip demand from areas such as 5G, Wi-Fi 6/6E, the Internet of Things, high-performance computing, and artificial intelligence. However, COVID-19-related supply chain disruptions, U.S.-China geopolitical tensions, and the unexpectedly cold winter in Texas have resulted in a global chip shortage. TSM is now taking steps to assuage this problem and has announced plans to invest $100 billion over the next three years in capacity expansion and research and development. However, the company expects the demand-supply mismatch to persist till 2022. Yet with TSM currently accounting for 57% of global chip production, the company is best positioned to benefit from this dynamic in terms of pricing power.
Advanced chips (7nm and smaller) accounted for 49% of the company's revenues in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 (ending March 31, 2021), much higher than the 35% revenue exposure in the same quarter of the prior year. The company has started generating revenues from 5nm nodes, while a 3nm node has yet to reach the mass production stage. Smartphone manufacturers are increasingly preferring smaller nodes for their high computing capability and power efficiency. With high-volume customers such as Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM), the company's technological edge is translating into robust revenue streams from the smartphone vertical.
While competitors such as Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) and Samsung have also unveiled aggressive capacity expansion plans, their success is far from guaranteed. Against this backdrop, TSM emerges as a superior pick, especially since it also pays a dividend yield of around 1.5%. Hence, although TSM is currently trading at 11.6 times trailing-12-month (TTM) sales, which is not cheap, investors can still earn robust returns from this stock in coming months.
2. Nio
Investors can also put their $1,000 to good use by picking up Nio. This stock has slumped over 38% from its all-time high of $66.99 in early January 2021. The company's woes stem mainly from retail investors shifting out of growth stocks into value picks and from the semiconductor shortages afflicting the entire automotive industry. It also did not help that the company missed its consensus earnings estimate in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 (ending December 31, 2020).
Despite all these setbacks, the structural tailwinds powering Nio are too strong to ignore. In 2020, China accounted for around 41% of global EV sales. Canalys estimates that 1.9 million EVs will be sold in China in 2021, a year-over-year increase of 51%. While EVs are expected to account for 9% of total automotive sales in China in 2021, the percentage is expected to increase to 35% by 2025. With the backing of the Chinese government and big technology companies such as Tencent (OTC: TCEHY) and Baidu (NASDAQ: BIDU), Nio is well positioned to capture a significant share of China's ever-expanding EV market.
Nio is now guiding for first-quarter revenues in the range of $1.13 billion to $1.16 billion, which implies year-over-year growth of 438% to 451%. These estimates are in line with Nio's 423% year-over-year rise in vehicle deliveries to 20,060 units in the first quarter. The company is expecting short-term pressures from semiconductor shortages in the second quarter. However, Nio has a history of underpromising and overperforming -- the company has surpassed its delivery target of 19,500 vehicles in the first quarter.
Nio's battery-as-a-service (BAAS) operating model allows customers to purchase EVs without batteries at lower upfront prices and then pay for batteries through monthly subscriptions. EV charging requires one and a half to two hours, but with this model EV users can swap an uncharged battery for a fully charged or even an upgraded battery in a matter of minutes. Currently operating 193 battery swapping stations in China, the company aims to expand the number to 500 by end of 2021. As Nio sells more vehicles, its BAAS revenues will continue to grow even faster. BAAS revenues are also recurring, which implies higher revenue visibility and lower top-line volatility for the company.
Nio is trading at 25.7 times TTM sales, which is quite rich. However, investors can earn handsome returns from investing in this stock even at these elevated levels, considering that Nio has a solid strategy to capitalize on the huge EV opportunity in China.
3. Gilead Sciences
Finally, Gilead Sciences can be a very smart place to put $1,000, especially for a risk-averse investor. The company pays a solid dividend yield of 4.3%, much higher than the S&P 500's yield of 1.4%. With a TTM dividend payout ratio of 46.25%, the company has sufficient financial flexibility to continue with its dividend policy in the foreseeable future.
However, this high-yield stock has declined over 15.8% in the last year. The first COVID-19 treatment for hospitalized patients approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Veklury may soon fall out of favor as increasing vaccination reduces the number of patients under treatment. In November 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended against using Veklury, which put a dent in the drug's sales.
But there is much more to Gilead Sciences than Veklury. The company dominates the HIV market and is also developing a significant presence in the oncology segment. To offset the impact of generic erosion of older HIV drugs such as Atripla and Truvada, Gilead Sciences has been focused on introducing new HIV drugs with better efficacy and safety profiles. The company's recently launched HIV drug, Biktarvy, is the top-prescribed drug for U.S. HIV patients. The company also expects to submit an application to the FDA for Lenacapavir as a long-acting treatment (to be injected once every six months) for heavily pretreated HIV patients. In oncology, Gilead Sciences is betting on cell therapy drug Yescarta and Trodelvy, a drug for breast and urothelial cancer (a common type of bladder cancer). Additionally, Trodelvy has the potential to be approved in several other solid tumor indications.
Gilead Sciences returned $5 billion or almost 67% of its total free cash flow to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases in 2020. Despite several attractive assets and favorable shareholder policy, the stock is trading at only 3.3 times TTM sales. This cheap stock is an attractive bet for both value and income investors.

2021-04-26 00:00:00+00:00,4 Must-See Quotes From ASML's CEO Show the Semiconductor Boom Has Legs,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/4-must-see-quotes-from-asmls-ceo-show-the-semiconductor-boom-has-legs-2021-04-26,,,"Last week, key semiconductor equipment supplier ASML Holdings (NASDAQ: ASML) reported its first-quarter earnings. The company delivered positive results while raising its full-year 2021 growth outlook to 30% -- even coming off a strong 2020. The stock climbed on the news.
ASML sells not only EUV lithography systems that make leading-edge logic semiconductor production possible, but also DUV systems that produce chips on lagging-edge nodes, along with e-beam metrology systems. It also serves the memory sector across both NAND and DRAM.
As such, ASML management is a great source of insight into the entire chip sector, which has become the focus of investors and politicians alike amid the recent shortage. While the semiconductor sector is known to be cyclical, several quotes from the recentearnings conference callsuggest this current boom could go on for years.

3 bullish trends all happening at once
You've probably read about the massive global semiconductor shortage, which first affected auto suppliers but has since spread to many other parts of tech. CEO Peter Wennink shared his take on the key reasons for the current supply-demand imbalance, which is the result of three massively bullish trends occurring all at once:
The first trend, in the shorter term there is a more cyclical or ""catch-up"" driven demand from decisions made in 2020 due to the global pandemic. ... The second, is a secular growth trend driven by the digital transformation taking place as we become a more connected world, across both people and machines. This transformation was further accelerated over the past year with the increased remote activity and reliance on technology to stay connected. ... And the third trend, which we are starting to see now and which we will likely continue to see longer term, is the desire for more technology sovereignty which includes semiconductor and silicon based technology, leading to a geographical decoupling as different governments put initiatives in place to localize supply chains and become more self-sufficient. This inevitably will create some level of inefficiency in the semiconductor supply chain and creates additional equipment demand as more fabs are strategically built across the globe.
The industry is coming off a big downturn spurred by the 2018-2019 trade war, and then COVID hit in 2020. The previous downturn led to caution on the part of OEMs in ordering chips and suppliers in adding capacity.
However, not only are we getting the cyclical bounceback from the extended downturn, but the pandemic also accelerated digital trends, leading to a massive upswing in semiconductor demand. On top of that, with all developed nations now looking to secure some capacity domestically, there will probably be some excess capacity built into the system now, which means even more sales of semiconductor equipment.

EUV demand could outstrip supply beyond next year
Not only are there shortages of end-market semiconductor chips made by ASML's machines, but there could also be shortages of the semi equipment machines themselves by next year. Wennink went on to say:
Limited by available modules and parts this year, we're still planning for growth of around 30% in EUV revenue this year. With the expanding adoption of EUV at our customers, we see increased demand building in 2022 and beyond. We are improving our manufacturing cycle time and are planning our supply chain for a capacity of around 55 systems next year and as a reminder, all of our planned shipments in 2022 will be NXE:3600D systems with the increased productivity capability.
So ASML is constrained by supply this year, and then available to only produce 55 machines next year -- albeit with 15% to 20% higher throughput per machine. That's up from 31 machines sold in 2020, or 75% growth over just two years. When factoring in higher throughput per machine, it's more like 100% growth in two years.
And there still appears to be growth beyond 2022. One analyst brought up the prospect of needing to increase capacity beyond 55 machines after 2022. Management said it was a distinct possibility that it's working through now, given that the U.S. may be looking to increase foundry capacity, with Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) announcing two new fabs and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) announcing it would build a large fab in the U.S. as well. The construction lead time for a new foundry is two to three years, so bringing those online should create demand even beyond the 2022 guidance.

Even DUV and mature nodes are in for reacceleration
While a lot of attention goes toward EUV and the latest, most advanced chips, the Internet of Things, autonomous vehicles, and ""smart everything"" applications run on sensors and RF filters made on older nodes. That's leading to a renewed boom in demand for older DUV machines for less-advanced nodes, which still make up a majority of ASML's revenue.
In fact, with EUV capacity already booked up for the year, it's the increased DUV demand that spurred ASML to increase its revenue outlook for the year. And management sees this DUV boom as greater and broader than the last upcycle in 2017-2018:
[A]s compared to three years ago 2018, I think we have a different view and that's driven by the fact that across our entire Deep UV portfolio which is immersion and dry, we have -- we cannot fulfill the demand of our customers on time and that has to do with the fact that our analysis shows that with the combination of, let's say, advanced sensing technology, 5G, the ability to process all that data through high performance compute and that in a distributed fashion basically leading edge compute also goes to the edge, I call that distributed systems and a distributed system is, for instance, a car, but it's also one of our machines in the field. ... And that increasingly requires collection of data, transport of data, processing of data not only through the most advanced high-performance compute, but as part of a distributed system. And that system inevitably includes mature technology, which could be image sensors, power ICs, MEMS, analogs solutions. It's the whole thing.
Thus, high-performance chips in 5G and big data/AI applications, rather than replacing older nodes, are counterintuitively spurring a demand boom on the lagging edge as well. That's leading to surging demand for ASML's older and highly profitable machines as well.

And don't forget memory: ""We are just starting""
ASML also makes DUV and e-beam machines for the memory industry, and some DRAM players are even beginning to use EUV in DRAM production these days.
Another part of the increase in ASML's 2021 guidance was an increase in memory machine growth to 50% for 2021, up from an initial 20% growth outlook. That eye-popping 50% growth number made some analysts nervous, who remember past instances when memory capital spending got way ahead of itself and led to oversupply. In fact, that happened as recently as 2018.
Still, Wennink, again, thinks the memory up-turn is more sustainable into next year as well:
[I]f you look at a bit growth of 20% this year, then our calculations show that we are very quickly at the max output capacity of our DRAM customers in this year, where we would reach that pretty quick. So we would need more capacity addition. That's exactly what we have seen. So I think it's just the beginning of all these things. So, yeah, I think, yes, [memory machine growth] will move into next year. Now you've been around also long so that in the Memory business, yes, there is more tendency to have from time to time some overcapacity and some under capacity. How long that will last, I don't know, but still there is something about telling me, hey, the secular trend when such a high demand in Logic, all this stuff doesn't only work with only Logic, also in Memory... Now I think having said that, Memory is more cyclical than Logic, but nothing that indicated to me at this moment in time that we are looking at building an overcapacity. There is nothing I can see at this moment in time. We're just starting.
It may not be too late to hop aboard the semi train
Investors in the semiconductor sector know all too well that just as boom times feel terrific, busts can be just as harrowing. As such, many may be nervous about investing in the midst of such a severe upswing.
Still, if ASML management's commentary is any indication, there are some deeper structural and secular things going on right now that may give the current cyclical upswing longer legs than some may think. While semiconductor stocks have admittedly gone up a lot since November, they are still by and large much cheaper than, say, software-as-a-service stocks, even though they all play into the same technology trends.
So with eyes open, I'd stick with these booming semi stocks through 2021 and into 2022 for now.
