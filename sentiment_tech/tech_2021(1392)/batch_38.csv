2021-03-24 00:00:00+00:00,Intel (INTC) Vs Advanced Micro Devices (AMD): Which Of These Semiconductor Stocks Is A Better Buy?,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intel-intc-vs-advanced-micro-devices-amd%3A-which-of-these-semiconductor-stocks-is-a-better,,,"These Top Semiconductor Stocks Have Been Trending On Wall Street This Month.
Semiconductor stocks performed extremely well in 2020. And analysts are expecting more great things in the industry in 2021. Simply put, the tech sector continues to thrive because it owes its massive success in no small part to the semiconductor industry. Although most top semiconductor stocks fell along with the stock market trading sideways in recent weeks, there isn’t a need to write off them just yet. In fact, the pull-back provides some great entry points for investors if you are in it for the long term.
The space has pulled back pretty significantly. And a lot of that could have something to do with the chip shortages. However, if you have a long-term horizon, it’s safe to assume that technology is only going to continue to grow. Don’t you think so? With the increasing digitization of the things we are using on a daily basis, we simply can’t ignore the fact that our life is increasingly dependent on semiconductors. Be it your favorite gadgets or the new Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) Model S that you are anticipating, all of them need semiconductors. 
With such high demand across industries, there are many reasons to be bullish on the future of the semiconductor industry. Sure, semiconductor growth may be hitting a speed bump with the shortages of chips. However, as these semiconductor companies ramp up their production, you can expect things to go up and running again. With all the hype going around non-fungible tokens (NFTs), investors need to know they too need semiconductors to function. But today, we are not going to talk about these new industries. Instead, we are looking at the stalwarts in the semiconductor space, namely Intel Corp. (NASDAQ: INTC) and Advanced Micro Devices Inc.(NASDAQ: AMD).

Intel Corp. (INTC)
Intel is a semiconductor titan that needs no introduction. Most would agree that the company’s presence in the industry is comparable to Samsung and Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE: TSM). Despite its reputation, it is not always sunshine for the semiconductor titan. Intel’s manufacturing problems came to light back in July 2020, as there was a “defect” in its manufacturing process.
For this reason, the company would have to delay its next-gen 7-nanometer chips until late 2022. The company’s stock, for the most part, has traded sideways for 2020. Since plummeting to a 1-year low of $43.61 per share during the end of October 2020, INTC stock has rebounded by over 40%. 
From the company’s most recent quarterly report, total revenue came in at $19.98 billion and cash on hand stood at $5.86 billion. Earlier this year, Pat Gelsinger was announced as the company’s new CEO. Gelsinger has been with the company for over 30 years. He is a proven technology leader with a distinguished track record for innovation and deep knowledge of Intel. 
INTC Stock Rallies After Aggressive Manufacturing Buildout Announcement
Gelsinger came up with a broad plan that mixes outsourcing with a commitment to spend $20 billion on new factories in Arizona that could help address a chip shortage. At the same time, the group is launching Intel Foundry Services to become “a major provider of foundry capacity” in both the US and Europe.

Gelsinger also said on Tuesday that Intel would rely more heavily on third-party chip-making partners, including some of its most cutting-edge processors, starting in 2023. With that being said, it doesn’t mean the company is abandoning its historic roots. After all, it has been both a designer and manufacturer of semiconductors. It would still retain most production in-house. Should the multi-year strategy from Gelsinger prove to be effective, this could potentially be a turnaround story for the company after falling behind Asian competitors such as Samsung and TSMC. 
“While it is no guarantee Intel can catch its competitors, much less restore this leadership, we believe Intel hired the leader that gives the company the best chance to do so,” stated Cowen analyst Matthew Ramsay, who has an outperform rating on Intel.

Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)
After spending decades behind the power curve, AMD took a technical lead as Intel’s progress short-circuited. Advanced Micro Devices designs and produces microprocessors for the computer and consumer electronics industries. The majority of the firm’s sales are in the computer market via CPUs and GPUs.
The company surprised Wall Street in late January with its fourth-quarter results, reporting smashing revenue growth and earnings year-over-year. From its latest quarterly result, the chipmaker’s revenue crossed the $3 billion mark for the first time. Despite the promising growth of the company, AMD stock has been caught up in the tech sell-off in the stock market in recent weeks.
There was one point where AMD stock had dropped 21% in just a span of three weeks. But the question here, should investors be buying the dips at these current levels?
Ryzen 5000 Mobile Processors Is The Catalyst For AMD Stock
One of the key reasons why the company overperformed in recent years was simply because of the company’s gains from the desktop PC market. Also, the company announced the full portfolio of AMD Ryzen 5000 Series Mobile Processors. These bring AMD’s highly efficient and extremely powerful core architecture to the laptop market. This play by the company is certainly well-timed. That’s because laptops are becoming an even more essential part of how we work and connect today.
Source: TD Ameritrade TOS
In the past, a relatively smaller proportion of laptops carried AMD chips. As laptops have gotten better sales than desktop PCs in the past decade, you could say AMD was missing out to some extent. Could this new chip change all that?
Here’s what PC World has to say about AMD’s hot new chip:
“Drop a Ryzen 5000 mobile processor into a laptop, and you end up with a machine that smashes expectations—a three-pound convertible can accomplish what yesterday’s six-pound gaming laptop did.”

Bottom Line: INTC Stock Vs AMD Stock
By and large, for all of Intel’s attributes, AMD is more likely to offer faster growth rates to investors. Intel may retain the client base and the cash flows to remain a force in the industry. However, considering the fact that Intel’s manufacturing buildout announcement is still fresh out of the oven, I would not bet on any significant improvement in the near term. 
On the flip side, with the recent weaknesses of AMD stock, I must say it is looking more attractive these days. Moreover, its technical lead means that AMD stock will remain a top semiconductor stock to watch for the foreseeable future. And its growing fortunes should offer strong returns to its shareholders.

TOKYO, March 24 (Reuters) - Japan's Nikkei share average fell on Wednesday for the fourth consecutive session as renewed concerns about the return of coronavirus lockdowns in Europe and declining oil prices dented hopes of an acceleration in the global economy.
The Nikkei 225 Index .N225 ended down 2.04% at 28,405.52. The broader Topix .TOPX fell 2.18% to 1,928.58, posting its biggest daily percentage decline since Feb. 26, and its third straight session of decline.
Energy shares led the decline as Germany's extension of pandemic lockdowns and lingering doubts about the safety of a popular coronavirus vaccine curbed expectations for a rebound in economic growth and demand for oil.
However, some technology shares got a boost from plans to increase investment in the production of cutting-edge semiconductors to ease global supply shortages.
Sentiment for Japanese shares was somewhat cautious as investors are expected to book profit before the fiscal year ends on the last day of this month.
""The decline in oil prices is a direct blow to the energy sector, but you can also see investors are selling shares that until recently were rallying very sharply,"" said Takashi Nishizawa, head ofinvestment researchat Nomura Securities.
""Investors are starting to realise that their optimism about the outlook was a little excessive.""
The biggest percentage loser in the index was Unitika Ltd 3103.T, down 9.25%, followed by ANA Holdings Inc 9202.T, losing 7.21%, and Mazda Motor Corp 7261.T, falling by 5.92%.
The top percentage gainer in the index was Nikon Corp 7731.T, which rose 6.44% on speculation it would benefit from U.S. semiconductor maker Intel Corp's INTC.O move to greatly expand its advanced chip manufacturing capacity.
Tokyo Electron Ltd 8035.T rose 5.06% and Screen Holdings Co Ltd 7735.T climbed 1.66% after the Nikkei newspaper reported that the two companies would collaborate with a Japanese government project that will invest in domestic manufacturing facilities for next-generation chips.
The volume of shares traded on the main board .TOPX was 1.41 billion, compared to the average of 1.44 billion in the past 30 days.

New Intel chief executive Pat Gelsinger announced a major investment plan on Tuesday, seeking to tilt a technological balance of power back to the United States and Europe.
A $7 billion investment in Ireland and Europe will more than double its available manufacturing space there, Intel's Irish general manager Eamonn Sinnott said. It currently employs 5,000 people in Ireland, mostly at its Leixlip campus located about 20km from central Dublin, making up half of its European workforce.
Sinnott said there will also be additional opportunities for investment in Europe as part of global plans to embrace the ""foundry"" business, where chip manufacturers open factories to outside customers. Intel has historically been a minor player in that area.
Irish Prime Minister Micheál Martin said the announcement was very welcome news as the government seeks to get people back to work and rebuild the economy from the COVID-19 crisis.
Ireland has been under a strict lockdown since late December, which is set to be only gradually unwound over the coming months. The unemployment rate, including those receiving temporary COVID-19 jobless benefits, stood at 24.8% last month.
The large multinational sector has shielded the economy from the worst of the crisis and now directly accounts for one in eight jobs across the economy after foreign owned firms added more jobs than they cut in 2020.
Digital payments giant Stripe announced 1,000 new jobs at Irish operation last week, while cloud software provider Workday WDAY.OQ. added 400 more jobs at its European headquarters in Dublin this week.

Intel shares were up about 6.6% in Tuesday’s extended trading session.
The plants will enhance Intel’s (INTC) semiconductor manufacturing capacity and the company expects to start planning and construction activities in 2021. These plants will address increasing requirements for current products while also providing committed capacity for foundry customers.
Dr. Randhir Thakur, President of Intel Foundry Services said, “We are grateful for our partnerships with the State of Arizona and the Biden administration for creating a business environment that encourages investment in semiconductor innovation and helps make this new expansion possible. We are excited to continue our long tradition of innovating and investing in Arizona.”
Intel plans to become a key provider of foundry capacity in the U.S. and Europe and serve global customers. Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger also outlined the company’s ‘IDM 2.0’ strategy which banks on manufacturing, innovation and product leadership.
IDM 2.0 will combine the company’s internal factory network, third party capacity and new Intel foundry services in order to create long term shareholder value.
Gelsinger said, “IDM 2.0 is an elegant strategy that only Intel can deliver – and its a winning formula. We will use it to design the best products and manufacture them in the best way possible for every category we compete in.”  (See Intel stock analysis on TipRanks)
On March 23, Barclays analyst Blayne Curtis reiterated a Sell rating on the stock and increased its price target to $58 from $53 (8.6% downside potential).  Commenting on the IDM 2.0 update, Curtis “struggles to see how the stock still works” and the normalized earnings which are closer to $3.50 per share “make this value idea much more expensive for a declining story.”
Turning to rest of the Street, the stock has a Hold consensus rating alongside an average analyst price target of $64.31 based on 12 Buys, 12 Holds and 6 Sells. Shares have rallied 28% over the past year.

TOKYO/SEOUL, March 24 (Reuters) - Japan has called on equipment makers to help one of its biggest chipmakers restore production, the latest government move aimed at easing a semiconductor shortage that has hit production at car companies and is now pressuring makers of electronic devices.
A chip plant owned by Renesas Electronics Corp 6723.T was hit by fire last week and replacing damaged machines could take several months. The company accounts for 30% of theglobal marketfor microcontroller units used in cars.
Underscoring the severity of the crisis, Hyundai Motor Co 005380.KS, until recently one of the automakers least affected due to prudent stockpiling, is facing curbs to production from April, the Financial Times reported on Wednesday, citing a person with direct knowledge of the situation.
Renesas is one of the South Korean automaker's chip suppliers.
A Hyundai representative said the company is closely monitoring the situation and will optimise production in line with supply conditions. A union official said the automaker had enough chips for its popular models but would be making fewer of models like the Sonata sedan which do not sell as well.
Shares in Hyundai ended down 2.4%.
Japanese bureaucrats have contacted companies at home and overseas to request they provide parts and machinery to Renesas, a trade ministry official told Reuters on Wednesday.
In a further sign that chip woes are spilling beyond the auto industry, Intel Corp INTC.O on Tuesday forecast lower-than expected annual profit, reflecting what it said was an industry-wide shortage of components such as substrates. The company's processors power personal computers and servers.
Earlier this month, sources also told Reuters that Qualcomm Inc QCOM.O was struggling to keep up with demand for its processor chips used in smartphones, including those made by Samsung Electronics 005930.KS.
In addition to Japan, Germany and the United States have also ramped up efforts to resolve the shortage, caused by a pandemic-driven surge in demand for consumer electronics and exacerbated by panic buying to shore up chip stockpiles.
The White House has held meetings with automakers and suppliers to identify chokepoints and is liaising with international allies. Berlin asked Taiwan in January to persuade its chip foundries to increase supply to German car makers.
Governments and companies are also positioning themselves for long-term survival in the highly competitive semiconductor industry which has often been a flashpoint for trade tensions.
Intel announced on Tuesday that it plans to spend as much as $20 billion to build two factories in Arizona, challenging Samsung Electronics Co Ltd 005930.KS and TSMC, the two other companies that make the most advanced chips.
The move suggests that the United States is keen to shift some technological balance of power back home, as it is concerned about the risks of having too much chipmaking concentrated in Taiwan given tensions with China.
In Japan, Canon Inc 7751.T, Tokyo Electron Ltd 8035.T and Screen Semiconductor Electron will join a government funded 42 billion yen ($385 million) programme that will cooperate with overseas foundries including TSMC to develop advanced 2 nanometre chips, demand for which will be driven by the introduction of 5G technology.
Japan wants to ensure it is able to build advanced semiconductors in the future and aims to build a test line near Tokyo with help from TSMC which plans to establish a research and development facility there, a trade ministry official said.

March 24 (Reuters) - European stocks slipped on Wednesday, as concerns about new lockdown measures overshadowed a surprise return to economic growth for the euro zone in March.
After falling as much as 0.7% in early morning trading, the pan-European STOXX 600 index .STOXX was down 0.2%.
Euro zone stocks .STOXXE also cut losses after IHS Markit's flash composite PMI, seen as a good guide to economic health, bounced above the 50 mark, separating growth from contraction, to 52.5 this month compared to February's 48.8.
While the data gave investors some relief, a third wave of coronavirus infections and renewed lockdown measures in Europe, as well as a slow vaccine rollout are likely to weigh on the final reading of the survey and April's numbers.
""We believe this is a pause, not the end of equity rally yet,"" said Michele Morganti, equity strategist at Generali Insurance Asset Management.
""COVID management is a bumpy road. We nevertheless think that recovery will be quite strong in the second half of the year.""
The European stocks benchmark has pulled away from a one-year peak hit last week after major economies like Germany and France imposed new lockdowns.
Meanwhile, the European Union is set to extend COVID-19 vaccine export curbs to Britain and other areas with much higher vaccination rates, and to cover instances of companies backloading contracted supplies, EU officials said.

TAIPEI, March 24 (Reuters) - Shares in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC) fell on Wednesday after Intel Corp INTC.O announced a $20 billion plan to expand its advanced chip manufacturing capacity, even as Taiwan's economy minister sought to downplay the impact.
Intel said on Tuesday it will build two factories in Arizona and open its plants to outside customers, directly challenging the two other companies in the world that can make the most advanced chips - TSMC 2330.TW, TSM.N and South Korea's Samsung Electronics Co Ltd 005930.KS.
Shares in TSMC, the world's largest contract chip manufacturer with clients including Apple Inc AAPL.O and Qualcomm Inc QCOM.O, fell as much as 3% on Wednesday morning, compared with a drop of around 1% on the broader market .TWII.
TSMC announced plans last May to build a $12 billion factory in Arizona, in an apparent win by the then-Trump administration in its push to wrestle global tech supply chains back from China.
Taiwan Economy Minister Wang Mei-hua said Intel's plan was ""not a challenge"" to the island's formidable semiconductor industry.
""First of all I believe that our whole semiconductor ecosystem is very good, and secondly our manufacturers are awesome, and are continually advancing their technology,"" she said.
Wang said she would be happy to see Taiwan-U.S. cooperation on semiconductors ""but of course we still hope they can increase their investment in Taiwan.""
The move by Intel's new Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger aims to restore Intel's reputation after manufacturing stumbles sent shares plunging last year.

March 23 (Reuters) - Intel Corp INTC.O will greatly expand its advanced chip manufacturing capacity as the new chief executive announced plans to spend as much as $20 billion to build two factories in Arizona and to open up its factories to outside customers.
The move by CEO Pat Gelsinger on Tuesday aims to restore Intel's reputation after technological missteps. The strategy will directly challenge the two other companies in the world that can make the most advanced chips, Taiwan's Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC) 2330.TW and Korea's Samsung Electronics Co Ltd 005930.KS.
And it will also aim to tilt a technological balance of power back to the United States and Europe as government leaders on both continents have become concerned about the risks of a concentration of chipmaking in Taiwan given tensions with China.
Intel shares rose 2.5% after the company disclosed its new strategy. Some investors such as Third Point LLC had previously urged Intel to consider spinning off its costly chip manufacturing operations after delays sent shares plunging last year.
Intel is one of the few remaining semiconductor companies that both designs and manufactures its own chips. Rival chip designers such as Qualcomm Inc QCOM.O and Apple Inc AAPL.O rely on contract manufacturers.
In an interview with Reuters, Gelsinger said Intel has ""fully resolved"" its problems with its most recent manufacturing technology and is ""all systems go"" on chips for 2023. It now plans a massive manufacturing expansion.
That will include spending $20 billion on two new factories at an existing campus in Chandler, Arizona, and then additional future sites in the United States and in Europe, Gelsinger said.
Intel will use those factories to make its own chips but also open them to outside customers in what is called a ""foundry"" business model in the chip industry. Gelsinger said the new factories will focused on cutting-edge computing chip manufacturing, rather than the older or specialty technologies that some manufacturers such as GlobalFoundries specialize in.
""We are absolutely committed to leading process technology capabilities at scale for the industry, and for our customers,"" Gelsigner said, adding that Intel has lined up customers for the new factories but could not disclose their names.
The move is a direct challenge to TSMC and Samsung. The two have come to dominate semiconductor manufacturing business, moving its center of gravity from the United States, where much of the technology was once invented, to Asia, where more than two-thirds of advanced chips are now manufactured.
Gelsinger said Intel will aim to change that global balance by embracing the foundry business where it historically has been a minor player. Intel will offer chip customers the ability license out its own technological crown jewels - known as the x86 instruction set architecture - as well as offer to build chips based on technology from Arm Ltd or the emerging open source technology RISC-V, he said.
""We will be picking our next sites within the next year for U.S. and Europe,"" he said. ""We're going to have committed capacity for foundry customers.""
Intel also announced plans for new research collaboration with IBM IBM.N focused on computing chip and packaging technology.
But even as Intel jumps into competition with TSMC and Samsung, it also plans to become a larger customer of theirs by turning to them to make subcomponents of its chips called ""tiles"" to make some chips more cost-effectively.
Intel plans to make the compute ""tiles"" for its ""Meteor Lake"" and ""Granite Rapids"" chips at its own factories for 2023 but will also offer PC and data center chips with compute tiles from TSMC, Gelsinger said, without giving more detail on the products with parts from TSMC.
""I'll pick the best process technologies wherever they exist,"" Gelsinger said. ""I leverage internal and external supply chains. I'll have the best cost structure. That combination of supply, products and costs, we think is a killer combination.""

Gelsinger said Intel will aim to change that global balance by embracing the foundry business where it historically has been a minor player. Intel will offer chip customers the ability license out its own technological crown jewels - known as the x86 instruction set architecture - as well as offer to build chips based on technology from Arm Ltd or the emerging open source technology RISC-V, he said.
""We will be picking our next sites within the next year for U.S. and Europe,"" he said. ""We're going to have committed capacity for foundry customers.""
But even Intel jumps into competition with TSMC and Samsung, it also plans to become a larger customer of theirs by turning to them to make subcomponents of its chips called ""tiles"" to make some chips more cost-effectively.
Intel plans to make the compute ""tiles"" for its ""Meteor Lake"" and ""Granite Rapids"" chips at its own factories for 2023 but will also offer PC and data center chips with compute tiles from TSMC, Gelsinger said, without giving more detail on the products with parts from TSMC.
""I'll pick the best process technologies wherever they exist,"" Gelsinger said. ""I leverage internal and external supply chains. I'll have the best cost structure. That combination of supply, products and costs, we think is a killer combination.""

2021-03-21 00:00:00+00:00,Where Will Vuzix Be in 5 Years?,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/where-will-vuzix-be-in-5-years-2021-03-21,,,"Vuzix (NASDAQ: VUZI), a developer of augmented reality glasses and headsets, was a penny stock throughout 2019 and most of 2020. Its stock remained below $5 a share as its unpredictable sales and ongoing losses curbed the market's enthusiasm for the growth potential of its AR business.
Vuzix's stock price dipped below $1 during the COVID-19 crash last March. But it subsequently bounced back above $4 by July, hit $10 in late December, and continued climbing to the mid-$20s this year. Let's look back at Vuzix's history, why it suddenly attracted a stampede of bulls, and whether or not it can maintain that momentum over the next five years.
Image source: Vuzix.
A first-mover's advantage in a niche market
Vuzix was founded in 1997. It initially developed products for the military but started producing consumer electronics devices in the early 2000s. Vuzix went public in 2013, and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) bought 30% of the company for $24.8 million in 2015.
At the time, Vuzix was selling its flagship AR glasses, the M100, to a handful of enterprise customers. It subsequently launched the M300, M400, and M4000 devices for enterprise customers over the following years, and developed AR glasses for big customers like Toshiba.
Vuzix launched its consumer-facing Blade AR glasses, which can be tethered to Amazon's (NASDAQ: AMZN) Alexa and Alphabet's (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google Assistant, in 2019. As a result, Vuzix's annual revenue rose more than fivefold between 2016 and 2020.
FISCAL YEAR

(23%)
160%
46%
(18%)
74%
Data source: Vuzix. YOY = Year-over-year.
That growth was impressive, but the AR market suffered several setbacks during that period. Google discontinued its consumer-facing version of Google Glass in early 2015 and pivoted the device toward enterprise users. Intel halted its AR headset partnership with Vuzix in 2016.
The first pair of AR glasses from Magic Leap, the start-up backed by Google and other tech giants, also fell woefully short of expectations when it finally arrived in 2018. Intel shut down its New Devices Group, which housed its wearable devices and smartglasses, that same year.
Those challenges, along with other disappointing product launches, snuffed out the hype for AR devices and caused many investors to question Vuzix's growth potential.
So what changed?
The AR market was seemingly on the ropes by 2019, but the pandemic boosted demand for its products again in 2020. Vuzix CEO Paul Travers called 2020 a ""transformational year"" for the AR market, as the pandemic sparked a shift to remote work in the enterprise and healthcare sectors.
Image source: Vuzix.
Vuzix attributed most of its growth in 2020 to robust sales of its M400 smartglasses, as well as brisk OEM orders from medical and defense customers. It ended the year with 184 approved or pending patents for AR technologies, up from 150 patents in 2019.
Vuzix didn't provide any specific guidance for 2021, but Travers claims the company is ""well-positioned to achieve significant year-over-year comparative revenue growth in our first quarter and throughout 2021"" as it sells more M-Series and Blade smartglasses.
Analysts expect Vuzix's revenue to rise 88% to $21.8 million in 2021, then jump another 87% to $40.6 million in 2022. Those estimates are rosy, but the stock is pricey at over 60 times this year's sales. Vuzix's bottom line also remains in the red, and analysts expect it to remain unprofitable for the foreseeable future.
But can the tailwinds offset the headwinds?
The bears will likely point out a few other major issues. Vuzix enjoys a first-mover's advantage in the AR market, but bigger challengers loom on the horizon, including Apple, Facebook, and Qualcomm -- which recently launched an AR reference design that lets OEMs easily produce their own headsets.
Intel also gradually reduced its stake in Vuzix and sold all its remaining shares earlier this year. The departure of its top backer and imminent competition from larger tech companies could throttle Vuzix's growth.
The bulls will argue that Vuzix doesn't need to go toe-to-toe with those tech giants. Instead, it just needs to hold onto a sliver of the expanding AR market.
For example, Grand View Research believes the AR market will grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 43.8% between 2021 and 2028 to become a $340.2 billion market. If Vuzix merely keeps pace with that market, it could generate multibagger gains within a few years.
Moreover, only 15% of Vuzix's shares are owned by institutions, and only four analysts currently cover the stock. If the stock gains more mainstream attention, it could have much more room to run.
So where will Vuzix be in five years?
Vuzix is still a speculative stock, but its first-mover's advantage, established customer base, and expanding lineup of enterprise-facing AR devices could drive its stock higher over the next five years. It'll be a bumpy ride, but the potential rewards could easily outweigh the near-term risks.

2021-03-19 00:00:00+00:00,"Senate's new finance cop, Oregon's Wyden, holds keys to Biden trade agenda",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/senates-new-finance-cop-oregons-wyden-holds-keys-to-biden-trade-agenda-2021-03-19-0,,,"By David Lawder
WASHINGTON, March 19 (Reuters) - Senate Finance Committee Chairman Ron Wyden, a Democrat who has been called both pro-trade and pro-labor, now holds major sway over President Joe Biden's trade agenda, with his buy-in needed to advance trade agreements in Congress.
But what Wyden doesn't want, he told Reuters in a recent interview, is sweeping new trade deals at the moment.
""I'm making the case, and you'll hear it when we're talking about Biden's Build Back Better agenda, that tougher trade enforcement is going to be a bedrock principle,"" said the Oregon Democrat.
In particular, Wyden said he will be a ""watchdog"" on Mexico's compliance with stronger labor standards in the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, through a new factory-level inspection mechanism he helped design. He is also calling for a tough stance on China, particularly against forced labor.
Like Biden, and many in Congress, Wyden's views on the benefits of free trade have shifted in recent years. In 2015, he brokered the current ""fast track"" negotiating authority that enabled the Obama administration to strike the 12-country Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal. He took heat for that effort from the left, with union groups protesting outside his Oregon home.
""What I came away with is that if you really want to rally workers and communities that have been hard hit (by trade), you’ve got to say that you’re going to do more for enforcement because that’s how you get a positive impact for workers and producers,” he said.
While Wyden's trade to-do list often overlaps with Biden campaign trade talking points, there are differences.
Wyden told Reuters that he won't sacrifice any American jobs to carbon border adjustment taxes, which are being considered by the administration as a way to push polluting countries to cut carbon emissions.
Wyden, who has served in the Senate since 1996, later clarified his comment to add: ""I will only consider a carbon tax if it includes a well-designed border adjustment, to ensure American workers are on a level playing field with overseas competitors.""
He will defend safe-harbor protections for U.S. technology companies and their high-paying jobs -- many in his home state of Oregon -- at a time when they are under pressure from tax authorities and regulators worldwide, as Biden's Treasury secretary, Janet Yellen, negotiates a deal on digital taxes.
Trade Promotion Authority, the ""fast-track"" negotiating legislation, expires on July 1, but don't expect Wyden to rush to renew it.
""I don't see TPA being a huge priority coming out of the gate right now,"" Wyden said. ""I want results for workers and their families, not more process.""
OREGON IS TRADE'S ""WINNER'S CIRCLE""
Wyden's home state of Oregon has often been in what he calls ""the winner's circle"" of trade, where he wants to put more Americans.
Oregon's massive exports of semiconductors, semiconductor manufacturing equipment, wheat and fertilizer ingredients produced a state international goods trade surplus of $7.61 billion in 2020, according to U.S. Census Bureau data. By comparison, California had a trade deficit of about $240 billion last year.
Intel Corp INTC.O has nearly 21,000 well-paid workers in Oregon, making it the state's largest corporate employer. Footwear giant Nike NKE.N based near Portland, is both a major U.S. importer and local employer with some 12,000 Oregon workers.
At the same time, Wyden, a 6-foot-4 senator who often jokes about his failed dreams to play in the National Basketball Association, has been a staunch defender of Oregon's lumber industry, applauding the Trump administration's tariffs on Canadian softwood lumber.
""Senator Wyden tends to be a bridge between people who are free-trade fundamentalists and those who want a worker-focused approach,"" said Jamieson Greer, a trade lawyer who served as chief of staff for former U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer during the Trump administration.
He calls Katherine Tai, who was sworn in as the first Asian-American woman to serve as USTR on Thursday, ""extremely well-suited"" for the job, but he admonished her to provide more transparency to the committee -- something that he did not get from Lighthizer.
Wyden said he agrees with the approach of the Biden administration to suspend certain tariffs in an aircraft subsidy dispute with Britain and the European Union to try to negotiate settlement and work through disputed digital services taxes.
Tai will discuss the issues in a phone call next week with UK trade minister Liz Truss.
But Wyden warned that if international negotiations allow Britain's digital taxes to stand and discriminate against U.S. technology platforms, ""They're going to have problems getting a free trade agreement with me.""

WASHINGTON, March 19 (Reuters) - Senate Finance Committee Chairman Ron Wyden, a Democrat who has been called both pro-trade and pro-labor, now holds major sway over President Joe Biden's trade agenda, with his buy-in needed to advance trade agreements in Congress.
But what Wyden doesn't want, he told Reuters in an recent interview, is sweeping new trade deals at the moment.
""I'm making the case, and you'll hear it when we're talking about Biden's Build Back Better agenda, that tougher trade enforcement is going to be a bedrock principle,"" said the Oregon Democrat.
In particular, Wyden said he will be a ""watchdog"" on Mexico's compliance with stronger labor standards in the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, through a new factory-level inspection mechanism he helped design. He is also calling for a tough stance on China, particularly against forced labor.
Like Biden, and many in Congress, Wyden's views on the benefits of free trade have shifted in recent years. In 2015, he brokered the current ""fast track"" negotiating authority that enabled the Obama administration to strike the 12-country Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal. He took heat for that effort from the left, with union groups protesting outside his Oregon home.
""What I came away with is that if you really want to rally workers and communities that have been hard hit (by trade), you’ve got to say that you’re going to do more for enforcement because that’s how you get a positive impact for workers and producers,” he said.
While Wyden's trade to-do list often overlaps with Biden campaign trade talking points, there are differences.
Wyden won't sacrifice any American jobs to carbon border adjustment taxes, which are under consideration by the new administration, he told Reuters.
He will defend safe-harbor protections for U.S. technology companies and their high-paying jobs -- many in his home state of Oregon -- at a time when they are under pressure from tax authorities and regulators worldwide, as Biden's Treasury secretary, Janet Yellen, negotiates a deal on digital taxes.
Trade Promotion Authority, the ""fast-track"" negotiating legislation, expires on July 1, but don't expect Wyden to rush to renew it.
""I don't see TPA being a huge priority coming out of the gate right now,"" Wyden said. ""I want results for workers and their families, not more process.""
OREGON IS TRADE'S ""WINNER'S CIRCLE""
Wyden's home state of Oregon has often been in what he calls ""the winner's circle"" of trade, where he wants to put more Americans.
Oregon's massive exports of semiconductors, semiconductor manufacturing equipment, wheat and fertilizer ingredients produced a state international goods trade surplus of $7.61 billion in 2020, according to U.S. Census Bureau data. By comparison, California had a trade deficit of about $240 billion last year.
Intel Corp INTC.O has nearly 21,000 well-paid workers in Oregon, making it the state's largest corporate employer. Footwear giant Nike NKE.N based near Portland, is both a major U.S. importer and local employer with some 12,000 Oregon workers.
At the same time, Wyden, a 6-foot-4 senator who often talks about his failed dreams to play in the National Basketball Association, has been a staunch defender of Oregon's lumber industry, applauding the Trump administration's tariffs on Canadian softwood lumber.
""Senator Wyden tends to be a bridge between people who are free-trade fundamentalists and those who want a worker-focused approach,"" said Jamieson Greer, a trade lawyer who served as chief of staff for former U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer during the Trump administration.
He calls Katherine Tai, who was sworn in as the first Asian-American woman to serve as USTR on Thursday, ""extremely well-suited"" for the job, but he admonished her to provide more transparency to the committee -- something that he did not get from Lighthizer.
Wyden said he agrees with the approach of the Biden administration to suspend certain tariffs in an aircraft subsidy dispute with Britain and the European Union to try to negotiate settlement and work through disputed digital services taxes.
Tai will discuss the issues in a phone call next week with UK trade minister Liz Truss.
But Wyden warned that if international negotiations allow Britain's digital taxes to stand and discriminate against U.S. technology platforms, ""They're going to have problems getting a free trade agreement with me.""

March 18 (Reuters) - A Swiss computer hacker who has claimed credit for helping steal or distribute proprietary data from Nissan Motor Co 7201.T, Intel Corp INTC.O and most recently security camera startup Verkada was indicted on Thursday, U.S. prosecutors announced.
Till Kottmann, 21, remains in Lucerne and has been notified about the pending charges, the U.S. attorney's office in Seattle said in a statement.
Kottmann did not immediately respond to a request for comment following the announcement of the indictment, which came after midnight in Lucerne.
Kottmann over the last year allegedly working with a group accessed internal files belonging to at least eight parties, including six unnamed companies, the Washington State Department of Transportation and an undisclosed federal agency, according to the indictment.
""Kottmann, and others, accessed protected computers, including 'git' and source code repositories as well as internal infrastructure, through use of stolen access keys, credentials and exploits,"" the indictment said.
It added Kottmann overall hacked dozens of businesses and government agencies and purportedly published leaked data from over 100 entities.
In social media posts and on a website, Kottmann allegedly shared some of the information and took credit for breaches, the document said.
Dates and descriptions in the indictment related to two of the alleged hacks match Kottmann's past statements about Intel and Nissan.
Intel declined to comment. Nissan and Verkada did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
This month, Kottmann shared with Reuters recordings of live and archived surveillance footage Kottmann obtained from inside a Tesla TSLA.O factory, an Alabama jail and other facilities by gaining access to Verkada's administrative system.
Prosecutors accused Kottmann of wire fraud, aggravated identity theft and conspiracy to commit computer fraud and abuse.
It was not immediately clear if or when Kottmann would be brought to the U.S. to face charges. Swiss authorities raided Kottmann's residence last week.
