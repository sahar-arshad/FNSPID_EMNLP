2021-02-01 00:00:00+00:00,Chip sales rose 6.5% globally in 2020 after year-end rush,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/chip-sales-rose-6.5-globally-in-2020-after-year-end-rush-2021-02-01,,,"By Stephen Nellis
Feb 1 (Reuters) - Global semiconductor sales rose 6.5% overall in 2020, as a recovery during the last three months of the year helped offset a sharp dropoff in March and April, when pandemic stay-home orders rolled out around the world.
Global sales were $439 billion in 2020, according to data from the Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA), a trade group that represents most U.S. chipmakers along with many international firms. The group said sales from U.S. chipmakers were about $208 billion, or about 47% of the total.
Chip sales into the United States were $94.15 billion, up 19.8% from the previous year.
Falan Yinug, SIA's director of industry statistics and economic policy, said much of the rise in U.S. purchasing was driven by high-end memory chips used in applications such as data centers.
American tech companies such as Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O, Microsoft Corp MSFT.O and Alphabet Inc's Google GOOGL.O all saw dramatic rises in the use of cloud computing over the course of 2020 as businesses adapted to working from home.
While U.S.-based companies represented nearly half of semiconductor sales, they represented only about 12% of chip manufacturing capacity in 2020. That is down from 37% in 1990, as most U.S. companies now source their chips from factories in Asia.
John Neuffer, president and chief executive of the industry group, said legislation passed last year to provide incentives to chip factories in the United States could help change that figure this year. The law could provide funding to U.S. companies such as Intel Corp INTC.O or GlobalFoundries, as well as foreign firms such as Samsung Electronics Co Ltd 005930.KS or Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd 2330.TW.
""Over the next 10 years, semiconductor manufacturing is going to grow 56%,"" Neuffer said. ""We want to make sure we're getting a bigger piece of the manufacturing pie.""

2021-01-31 00:00:00+00:00,AMD: Time to Buy This Hot Growth Stock,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/amd%3A-time-to-buy-this-hot-growth-stock-2021-01-31,,,"Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) wowed Wall Street with its fourth-quarter results, posting huge year-over-year growth in revenue and earnings thanks to solid demand for its products across various verticals.
The chipmaker's revenue jumped 53% year over year in the fourth quarter to $3.24 billion. This was the first time AMD's quarterly revenue crossed the $3 billion level. Non-GAAP net income jumped 66% to $636 million, and earnings per share soared to $0.52 from $0.32 in the prior-year period. Analysts were expecting AMD to earn $0.47 per share on revenue of $3.03 billion.
AMD believes this terrific momentum will continue in the new year, primarily driven by growth in the data center, video gaming, and the personal computer (PC) businesses. These segments could help AMD deliver more upside in 2021. Let's see how.

AMD's guidance sets the stage for a terrific year
AMD expects 37% revenue growth in 2021. That's impressive considering that the chipmaker delivered a 45% jump in the top line last year to $9.76 billion. Additionally, AMD expects a non-GAAP gross margin of 47% this year, up 2 percentage points over 2020 levels.
AMD's guidance is way better than Wall Street's expectation of 25.7% revenue growth for 2021. That's not surprising, as the catalysts that powered its growth in 2020 could get even better in the new year.
The computing and graphics business, for instance, is sitting on a couple of strong tailwinds. Accounting for nearly two-thirds of the top line, this segment's revenue shot up nearly 37% year over year on the back of strong sales of its Ryzen desktop processors.
AMD said on its latest earnings conference call that the sales of its new Ryzen 5000 desktop processors that were launched in October 2020 were more than double ""the launch quarter sales of any prior-generation Ryzen desktop processor."" On the other hand, sales of AMD's laptop-focused Ryzen 4000 chips increased in the double digits on a year over year basis, thanks to the 100 design wins the company had scored in early 2020 for these processors. In fact, AMD closed 2020 with record shipments of its mobile processors.
AMD is looking to turn things up a notch in 2021. The company recently released its Ryzen 5000 mobile processors based on the updated Zen 3 architecture. The company claims that the new laptop chips can deliver up to 23% performance gains and a longer battery life of up to 17.5 hours.
What's more, AMD management says that it aims to ""increase the number of notebook designs powered by our new Ryzen 5000 processors by 50% compared to our prior generation."" In simpler words, laptop and notebook original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) are going to launch more models with AMD processors.
Meanwhile, AMD looks set to take away more market share from Intel in the desktop processor space as well. Wall Street analysts expect AMD to boost its CPU market share to 50% in 2021 as compared to 22.4% in the third quarter of 2020, driven by the chipmaker's technological advantage over Intel.
The graphics business is also in fine form for AMD. The RX 6000 series graphics cards that the company launched late last year are witnessing overwhelming demand, with ""launch quarter shipments three times larger than any prior AMD gaming GPU priced above $549."" The chipmaker has been unable to produce enough cards to meet the strong demand so far, and it continues to ramp up production to address the supply constraint.
All of this indicates that AMD's computing and graphics business is about to have a solid year ahead.
More reasons to buy
AMD's enterprise, embedded and semi-custom (EESC) business accounts for the remainder of the company's top line, and it came into its own in 2020. The segment's revenue shot up 65% last year to $3.33 billion. Fourth-quarter growth was even more astronomic, with a year-over-year revenue spike of 176%.
The EESC business has stepped on the gas lately thanks to the arrival of Sony's and Microsoft's latest gaming consoles, which use AMD's chips. The company points out that sales of its semicustom chips used in the latest consoles are growing at a faster pace than the previous console cycle. More importantly, AMD expects sales of its semicustom chips to remain stronger than usual in the first half of 2021.
AMD is also upbeat about the server market, where customers such as Microsoft, Google, and Tencent are buying more of its EPYC server processors. The number of cloud instances powered by AMD's chips doubled in 2020 to more than 200. The company looks all set to carry forward this momentum in 2021 with the impending launch of a new generation of server chips that could help it take more share of the server market and substantially boost revenue.
So investors who missed AMD's impressive rally in 2020 have reason to cheer, as the good times can continue this year. What's more, they now have a good opportunity to buy this hot growth stock after its post-earnings dip and set themselves up for long-term gains.

While that only increased their holding size by 8.5%, it is still a big swing by our standards.
Intel Insider Transactions Over The Last Year
In fact, the recent purchase by Robert Swan was the biggest purchase of Intel shares made by an insider individual in the last twelve months, according to our records. That means that an insider was happy to buy shares at above the current price of US$55.51. While their view may have changed since the purchase was made, this does at least suggest they have had confidence in the company's future. We always take careful note of the price insiders pay when purchasing shares. It is generally more encouraging if they paid above the current price, as it suggests they saw value, even at higher levels.
Happily, we note that in the last year insiders paid US$3.0m for 51.74k shares. But they sold 491.00 shares for US$32k. In total, Intel insiders bought more than they sold over the last year. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below.

Intel is not the only stock insiders are buying. So take a peek at this free list of growing companies with insider buying.
Does Intel Boast High Insider Ownership?
Another way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. Intel insiders own about US$87m worth of shares. That equates to 0.04% of the company. This level of insider ownership is good but just short of being particularly stand-out. It certainly does suggest a reasonable degree of alignment.
What Might The Insider Transactions At Intel Tell Us?
It is good to see recent purchasing. And the longer term insider transactions also give us confidence. Given that insiders also own a fair bit of Intel we think they are probably pretty confident of a bright future. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. Be aware that Intel is showing 2 warning signs in our investment analysis, and 1 of those is a bit concerning...

2021-01-30 00:00:00+00:00,Best Stocks To Buy Right Now? 4 Tech Stocks To Watch On Monday,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/best-stocks-to-buy-right-now-4-tech-stocks-to-watch-on-monday-2021-01-30,,,"Are These Top Tech Stocks On Your Watchlist This Week?
You can’t deny that tech stocks have been on a roll. Some of the top tech stocks continue to bring investors returns even amidst a global health crisis. This is great for tech investors who have been on that train in the stock market since last year. However, there is a new concern that came along with this new year. With Joe Biden as president, there could be efforts to reform tax laws which lead to an increase in taxes.
Well, Wall Street analyst, Brian Fitzgerald brought up a good point saying that Congress is too divided to decide on the matter. He also adds that it could only happen once a broader economic recovery sets in. Seeing as the pandemic is still months away from ending, the tech industry could still have room to grow.
Generally, tech makes up a majority of the world we live in now. If it weren’t for the tech industry we would not have all our gadgets that make life easy now. Whether it is work-from-home stocks like Zoom (NASDAQ: ZM) or consumer tech stocks like Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), tech sells. Given the versatility of tech, the industry is ripe with options for new and seasoned investors alike. As such, here is a list of four diverse tech stocks to watch in the stock market this week.
4 Top Tech Stocks To Watch This Week
Uber Technologies Inc. (NYSE: UBER)
Sea Limited (NYSE: SE)
PayPal Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ: PYPL)
Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC)
Uber Technologies Inc.
Starting us off is California-based tech company Uber. Before the pandemic hit, the company’s most profitable business was its ride-hailing services. Over the past year, the company has expanded its other divisions heavily. These include its food and package delivery services among others. On Thursday, the company announced a new update to its delivery services in New York. At the same time UBER stock jumped by over 7% during intraday trading.
In the announcement, Uber revealed that it plans to expand its on-demand prescription medication delivery service. The company will be collaborating with Nimble, an emerging prescription delivery service in the U.S. Through this alliance, Uber Eats can now provide New Yorkers with their prescriptions straight from local neighborhood pharmacies. Moreover, customers will be able to access these services within the Uber smartphone app as well. As the company expands its business, it continues to show its resilience amidst these tough times. It could provide investors with another reason to watch UBER stock in the months to come.
In its third-quarter fiscal posted in November, Uber posted total revenue of $3.13 billion. Furthermore, it also ended the quarter with $6.15 billion in cash on hand. After considering how badly the pandemic affected its core business, this is a win for the company. Should investors be watching UBER stock ahead of its fourth-quarter fiscal scheduled on February 10? You tell me.

Sea Limited
Sea Limited is another tech stock to watch right now. The consumer internet company is involved in the digital entertainment, e-commerce, and digital financial service industries. It operates through its Garena, Shopee, and SeaMoney subsidiaries respectively. Seeing as it has investments in three pandemic boosted industries, it is no wonder that investors would be watching SE stock. Over the past year, SE stock has gained by over 380% on the stock market. However, Sea Limited’s recent move may show that it is not resting on its laurels yet.
Earlier this week, news broke regarding the company’s e-commerce division Shopee. According to Reuters, the company seems to be eyeing the Latin American e-commerce market. A LinkedIn opening for over three dozen positions based in Brazil was posted by Shopee. Interestingly, Shopee’s Vietnam unit Managing Director, Pine Kyaw, was listed as being the Shopee Brazil head on the platform. If this is the case, we would be looking at Southeast Asia’s largest e-commerce player going up against MercadoLibre (NASDAQ: MELI). Understandably, this marks an extremely ambitious move by the company.
For one thing, Sea Limited has solid financials backing it up. In its third-quarter fiscal reported in November, the company saw a 98% year-over-year leap in total revenue. This added up to a cool $1.21 billion for the quarter. It also reported having $3.51 billion in cash on hand. Given all of this, will you be watching SE stock?

PayPal Holdings Inc.
Following that, we have major fintech player, PayPal. The online payment solutions provider has been making waves lately. From waiving check-cashing fees on stimulus checks to facilitating cryptocurrency purchases, PayPal seems to be firing on all cylinders. Likewise, PYPL stock has surged by over 175% since the March selloffs. Despite having its best year on the market, PayPal does not seem to be slowing down anytime soon.
On January 27, it was announced that PayPal would be collaborating with Netherlands-based e-commerce company Vistaprint. The Cimpress (NASDAQ: CMPR) subsidiary will work together with PayPal to bring contactless payment solutions to small businesses across the U.S. In this arrangement, PayPal’s touch-free payment solution will play a crucial role in enabling small businesses to operate amidst the pandemic. Additionally, the duo is aiming to implement this partnership for Vistaprint’s clients throughout Europe later this year as well. As PayPal continues to expand its market presence and clients, PYPL stock could possibly follow suit.
Back in November, the company reported one of its strongest quarters to date. It brought in total revenue of $5.46 billion. Furthermore, it saw year-over-year jumps of 121% in net income and 120% in earnings per share. As PayPal kicks into high gear, could PYPL stock be looking at another record year? I’ll let you decide.

Intel Corporation
Fourth, we will be looking at semiconductor-giant Intel. Most would agree that the company’s presence in the industry is comparable to Samsung and Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE: TSM). Despite its reputation, INTC stock has been trading sideways, for the most part, seeing gains of 12% this month. Nevertheless, the company’s latest investment shows that it still has growth in mind in 2021.
According to Reuters, Intel has invested an additional $475 million in its Vietnam unit. This is on top of the $1 billion it has put towards its state-of-the-art chip assembly facility in Saigon. Overall, the $1.5 billion in investments is supposedly going towards 5G product acceleration. Coupled with its announcement regarding its shift in manufacturing strategy last week, the company seems to have a busy year ahead. Naturally, it would not surprise me if investors had INTC stock on their radars.
If that wasn’t enough, the company released its fourth-quarter fiscal just last week. In it, Intel saw $19.98 billion in total revenue and $5.86 billion in cash on hand. CEO Bob Swan summarized, “We significantly exceeded our expectations for the quarter, capping off our fifth consecutive record year.” Considering its financial position and ambitious moves, could INTC stock be making a comeback this year? Your guess is as good as mine.

2021-01-30 00:00:00+00:00,Better Buy: Intel or All 30 Dow Jones Stocks?,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/better-buy%3A-intel-or-all-30-dow-jones-stocks-2021-01-30,,,"Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) is a member of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, and the company finds itself at a critical juncture following a headline-grabbing 2020. After a year of operational challenges and two steep drops in share price, new CEO Pat Gelsinger will shortly take the reins of the microchip giant in hopes of executing a strategic turnaround. This could deliver a nice bump for Intel shareholders over the year or two, but even that potential growth might not make it a better buy than simply holding the entire Dow Jones.
Index investing can be a great way to diversify and reduce risk, but it usually means sacrificing some of the upside potential of a more focused portfolio of individual stocks. Investors who are considering Intel over the Dow 30 need to determine if Intel's upside potential is large enough to justify foregoing the reduced risk and volatility provided by a diversified index.
Intel at a crossroads
In 2020, Intel experienced some erosion of its dominant market position. Resurgent archrival AMD (NASDAQ: AMD) gained ground, and other competitors also outperformed the chip giant.
Intel is also dealing with the challenge that major customers like Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) are starting to design microchips for their own products in house.
Image source: Getty Images
Last July, the company disappointed investors by announcing that the release of its next-generation 7-nanometer chips would be delayed by a full year. The semiconductor industry is highly competitive, and Intel had previously struggled to keep pace with its peers in the prior 10-nanometer generation of chips. Being a laggard in the rollout of next-generation chips will not only hurt sales, but will also impact pricing and profit margins. News of the delay contributed to the shares falling 20% in July.
The trouble continued in October after Intel reported mixed third-quarter results with worrisome commentary. The company exceeded sales expectations and raised its guidance, but it fell short on GAAP profits, and there was a major decline in demand among data center customers. After two big sell-offs, activist investors from the hedge fund Third Point stepped in and demanded changes from Intel's management to fix the problems that have plagued the semiconductor giant. That involvement led to the board tapping a new CEO, and investors will hope that Intel can recover some of its lost market dominance.
Image and data source: Ycharts
At this point, Intel's valuation metrics appear relatively cheap for any optimistic investors. The stock trades at a forward P/E ratio of 12.3, which is fairly low in the current market. Its enterprise-value-to-EBITDA ratio of 6.4 is also attractive. That indicates that there's room for the stock to appreciate. However, its 2.3% dividend yield at current share prices is somewhat mediocre, and that's especially relevant for a mature, low-growth company like this one.
Diversification without sacrificing growth
Owning an index rather than a single stock comes with benefits and disadvantages. Diversification dilutes the degree to which any individual faltering company can drag down your entire portfolio, so owning a large number of stocks is good for reducing volatility. However, it also puts a cap on how much impact any single big winner can have on your total returns.
Intel might outperform the market if its current strategic shift successfully reestablishes the company's market dominance. However, Intel isn't likely to generate huge returns for investors through rapid sales or earnings growth. Owning the other 29 stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Index probably won't limit portfolio growth relative to Intel, but it will greatly reduce risk and volatility. The Dow is spread out across numerous sectors, and it still provides plenty of exposure to growth areas such as tech, pharmaceuticals, and consumer cyclical stocks.

It's hard to identify a clear advantage that Intel shares have over a portfolio of all 30 Dow Jones stocks, but the index provides an undeniable edge in risk reduction.

2021-01-29 00:00:00+00:00,Here's Why Intel Stock Could Regain Its Early-2020 Highs,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/heres-why-intel-stock-could-regain-its-early-2020-highs-2021-01-29,,,"Up around 20% from its low in March 2020, we believe Intel stock (NASDAQ: INTC) has further room for more than 20% upside to levels it traded at before the outbreak of the coronavirus.. The company’s stock trades at $55 currently and is, in fact, down almost 10% since the start of 2020. It traded at $67 in February 2020 – just before the outbreak of coronavirus – and is currently around 20% below that level, as well. Further, the rise in computing device sales has driven up demand for the company’s products, as is evident from Intel’s strong full-year 2020 results. For full-year 2020, Intel reported net sales of $77.9 billion, up a little over 10% from $72 billion last year. Despite a higher effective tax rate, a drop in operating expenses helped drive EPS up to $4.94 from $4.71 in 2019. We believe this can help boost Intel’s share price by more than 20% to its pre-Covid high of $67. Our conclusion is based on our comparative analysis of INTC stock performance during the current crisis with that during the 2008 recession in our interactive dashboard.
2020 Coronavirus Crisis
Timeline of 2020 Crisis So Far:
12/12/2019: Coronavirus cases first reported in China
1/31/2020: WHO declares a global health emergency.
2/19/2020: Signs of effective containment in China and hopes of monetary easing by major central banks helps S&P 500 reach a record high
3/23/2020: S&P 500 drops 34% from the peak level seen on Feb 19, as COVID-19 cases accelerate outside China. Doesn’t help that oil prices crash in mid-March amid Saudi-led price war
Since 3/24/2020: S&P 500 recovers 72% from the lows seen on Mar 23, as the Fed’s multi-billion dollar stimulus package suppresses near-term survival anxiety and infuses liquidity into the system.
In contrast, here is how INTC stock and the broader market fared during the 2007-08 crisis.
Timeline of 2007-08 Crisis
10/1/2007: Approximate pre-crisis peak in S&P 500 index
9/1/2008 – 10/1/2008: Accelerated market decline corresponding to Lehman bankruptcy filing (9/15/08)
3/1/2009: Approximate bottoming out of S&P 500 index
12/31/2009: Initial recovery to levels before accelerated decline (around 9/1/2008)
INTC and S&P 500 Performance Over 2007-08 Financial Crisis
We see INTC stock declined from levels of around $22 in September 2008 (pre-crisis peak) to around $13 in March 2009 (as the markets bottomed out), implying INTC stock lost more than 40% from its approximate pre-crisis peak. It recovered post the 2008 crisis, to just above $20 in early 2010, rising by around 60% between March 2009 and January 2010. The S&P 500 Index saw a decline of 51%, falling from levels of 1,540 in September 2007 to 757 in March 2009. It then rallied to levels of 1,124, rising by about 48% between March 2009 and January 2010.
INTC Fundamentals Over Recent Years
INTC revenues increased from $62.8 billion in 2017 to $77.9 billion in 2020, due to higher revenues across all revenue segments, driven by rising chipset sales. Along with higher revenue, earnings also jumped, with EPS rising from $2.04 to $4.98 during this period.
Does INTC Have Enough Cash Cushion To Meet Its Obligations Through The Coronavirus Crisis?
Intel’s total debt rose from $26.8 billion in 2017 to $36.4 billion in 2020, while its total cash also jumped from around $5.2 billion to $8.2 billion over the same period. Further, the company generated over $35 billion cash from operations in fiscal 2020. This steady cash position combined with strong cash from operations provides the company a reasonable cushion to deal with the current crisis.
Conclusion
Phases of Covid-19 Crisis:
Early- to mid-March 2020: Fear of the coronavirus outbreak spreading rapidly translates into reality, with the number of cases accelerating globally
Late-March 2020 onward: Social distancing measures + lockdowns
April 2020: Fed stimulus suppresses near-term survival anxiety
May-June 2020: Recovery of demand, with gradual lifting of lockdowns – no panic anymore despite a steady increase in the number of cases
July-November 2020: Weak Q2 and Q3 results, but continued improvement in demand and progress with vaccine development buoy market sentiment
Despite the recent surge in the number of new Covid-19 cases in the U.S., we see the rise in computing and gaming device sales to continue on the back of the surge in online activity. We believe that Intel stock has potential upside in the near term, and even as the lockdowns are gradually lifted, a drop in computing device demand does not seem very likely. This could see Intel stock potentially rise over 20% from its current level.

Presumably the only reason an insider would take their hard-earned cash and use it to buy stock of their company in the open market, is that they expect to make money — maybe they find the stock very undervalued, or maybe they see exciting progress within the company, or maybe both. So in this series we look at the largest insider buys by the ''top brass'' over the trailing six month period, one of which was a total of $1.9M invested across 2 purchases by Robert Holmes Swan, CEO at Intel Corp (Symbol: INTC).

2021-01-28 00:00:00+00:00,Here's Why Amazon Will Never Be a Dow Jones Industrials Stock,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/heres-why-amazon-will-never-be-a-dow-jones-industrials-stock-2021-01-28,,,"The Dow Jones Industrial Average has existed for 125 years and is one of the most widely recognized stock market indexes in the world.
While many investors believe the purpose of the index is to generally represent the U.S. economy, in fact that's true only in broad strokes. Originally it was just industrial companies (hence the name), but now other sectors of the economy are reflected in the 30 stocks that make up the Dow.
Yet despite technology companies being present in the index, one name you won't see there is Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), even though it is arguably one of the businesses most integral to the tech sector and to the economic health of the country as a whole.
Image source: Getty Images.
The one constant is change
The Dow Jones Industrial Average is a fluid index. Its components having changed about 60 different times over its history, or about once every two years.
Although most changes Dow Jones makes to the index make sense, at other times not so much. For example, salesforce.com (NYSE: CRM) was added to keep up the technology component of the index after Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) split its stock 4-for-1 and ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM) was removed.
Although Dow Jones explained at the time that the changes helped ""diversify the index by removing overlap between companies of similar scope and adding new types of businesses that better reflect the American economy,"" salesforce.com is hardly more representative than Amazon.
Not only are Amazon's e-commerce operations essential to tens of millions of consumers, but its cloud computing division, Amazon Web Services, is also the digital backbone to hundreds of corporations, educational institutions, nonprofits, healthcare facilities, and even the U.S. and foreign governments.
That means the Dow is not really representative of today's digital economy, and this explains why the Dow badly trailed the performance of the S&P 500 and Nasdaq exchanges last year. While the Nasdaq gained 24% and the S&P 16%, the Dow rose just 7.3% in 2020.
Carrying the weight
Today, Salesforce's valuation has grown to almost $210 billion (about equal to Exxon's), which makes it the 15th biggest stock on the Dow Jones index.
But because the Dow is a price-weighted index, not market-weighted, the tech stock's $225 share price means it's actually the sixth most expensive stock, representing 4.79% of the index's weighted total.
That also explains why Amazon isn't in the Dow Jones Industrial Average and likely never will be.

When Apple split its stock, Dow Jones explained the change ""will reduce the index's weight in the Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS) Information Technology sector."" It needed a tech stock to offset that, which is why it chose Salesforce.
Had it added Amazon to the index, its $3,300 share price would have dramatically skewed the benchmark in its favor. Any movement made by the stock would account for all of the index's action that day. And Amazon isn't likely to split its stock anytime soon, if ever.
Keep dreaming
The digital giant split its shares thrice in the 1990s after going public, keeping the stock below $100. But over the ensuing decades as the shares' value ran higher, Amazon chose not to divide them up.
Now that its business has grown far beyond its humble roots as an online bookseller, the need to be friendly to retail investors isn't an imperative. Besides, Amazon would have to split its shares by 10-to-1 or more to reduce them to a level at which Dow Jones would even consider it.
Amazon may be one of the more important straws that stir the nation's economic drink, but that doesn't mean the tech stock will find its way into what remains to many the most important stock index today.

2021-01-28 00:00:00+00:00,Qualcomm loses fight against EU antitrust regulators' data demand,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/qualcomm-loses-fight-against-eu-antitrust-regulators-data-demand-2021-01-28,,,"By Foo Yun Chee
BRUSSELS, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Qualcomm QCOM.O on Thursday lost its fight against a data demand from EU antitrust regulators after Europe's top court reaffirmed the regulators' right to see it, in a case that has already landed the company a 242-million-euro ($292.60 million) fine.
The ruling by the Luxembourg-based Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) will strengthen the European Commission's hand in other antitrust investigations.
Qualcomm's run-ins with the Commission have seen it receive total fines of 1.2 billion euros in two cases in the last three years for using its market power to thwart rivals including Intel INTC.O.
Its grievances with the EU competition enforcer date from 2017 when it was told to provide more information in a case in which it was accused of predatory pricing between 2009 and 2011 to squash British phone software maker Icera, subsequently bought by Nvidia Corp.
Qualcomm said the request exceeded the investigation's scope. It took its case to the General Court, Europe's second-highest, but lost its challenge in 2019. It then appealed to the CJEU.
The Court backed the EU antitrust watchdog.
""Having regard to the broad powers of investigation conferred on the Commission by Regulation No 1/2003, it is for the Commission to decide whether a particular item of information is necessary to enable it to bring to light an infringement of the competition rules,"" judges said.
Qualcomm is the subject of a third case in which EU enforcers are investigating whether it engaged in anti-competitive behaviour by leveraging its market position in 5G modem chips in the radio frequency chip market.
The case is C-466/19 P Qualcomm and Qualcomm Europe v Commission.

SEOUL, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics 005930.KS on Thursday commented for the first time on Intel's INTC.O decision to outsource more of its chipmaking, but declined to talk about any possible partnership with one its key rivals.
Intel, one of the few remaining firms that both designs and makes its own chips, said last week it would lean more heavily on outside factories, or foundry manufacturers, and could even licence technology from outside firms.
Samsung, the top maker of memory chips, and TSMC 2330.TW, the world's biggest contract chip manufacturer, are considered Intel's only competitors for high-end chips.
""We do think that Intel's decision to outsource - from the entire foundry market perspective - will lead to increasing overall foundry market size,"" Shawn Han, senior vice president of Samsung's foundry business, told a post-earnings call.
However, he declined to comment on any possible partnership or quantify the impact of such a move by Intel, which comes as some investors think the company has lost its manufacturing lead to Asian firms.
Intel already partners with TSMC to make chips used in self-driving cars, and sources told Reuters earlier this month that it plans to tap the Taiwanese company to make some graphics chips for personal computers.
Intel could also outsource legacy products like graphics chips, rather than its flagship processors, said Greg Roh, head of research centre at Hyundai Motor Securities.
""Because legacy products don't require a lot of advanced technology, it seems that Intel will decide outsourcing amount after seeing how things stand with both Samsung and TSMC. Intel is not in a position to be dependent on a particular company,"" he said.
TSMC stood a better chance than Samsung of teaming up with with Intel as it was just a contract manufacturer, said Lee Seung-woo, an analyst at Eugene Investment & Securities.
Samsung on Thursday forecast solid demand for its chips in the March quarter, as work-from-home devices such as laptops and tablets continue to fly off shelves.

Intel’s (INTC) recent woes have been well-documented, and to add insult to injury, the chip giant was forced to release its 4Q20 earnings earlier after its website was hacked, resulting in a leak of sensitive financial data.
Intel’s case wasn’t helped by theearnings call Incoming CEO Pat Gelsinger said that the company plans on sticking to its IDM (integrated device manufacturer) model and will keep on building most of the company’s chips in-house. However, Gelsinger also said the company will continue outsourcing some of its chip manufacturing while it upgrades its manufacturing process.
Which evidently was not what investors wanted to hear. Needham analyst Quinn Bolton believes “some investors may have hoping for a higher portion of 7nm to be outsourced to improve capital efficiency.”
The lack of clarity overshadowed what was a better-than-expected report.
Intel delivered revenue of $20 billion, declining by 1% year-over-year, yet beating the estimates by $2.5 billion. There was a beat on the bottom-line too, with Non-GAAP EPS of $1.52 coming in ahead of the Street’s forecast by $0.41.
Intel didn’t provide FY21 guidance, but its forecast for Q1 revenue of $17.5 billion beat the Street's call by approximately $1.2 billion. 
While the reaction on the Street to Intel’s latest quarterly results has been decidedly mixed, Bolton believes there is much to be upbeat about.
“With new CEO Pat Gelsinger coming onboard, we believe Intel will be able to identify weaknesses in its processor roadmap and reestablish its processor performance leadership,” the 5-star analyst said. “We believe Intel will outsource some advanced manufacturing to TSMC, thereby reducing its capital intensity, improving free cash flow and improving shareholder returns. Further, we think Intel plans to protect its share in DCG from AMD by competing more on price while regaining its technological leadership with 7nm... Lastly, we believe a low valuation relative to peers suggest upside in INTC shares.”
Overall, Bolton stay with the bulls. The analyst rates INTC shares a Buy and keeps his $70 price target intact. Investors are looking at upside of 25%, should Bolton’s thesis play out accordingly. (To watch Bolton’s track record, click here)

One week ago, Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) unveiled its plan to turn around its troubled semiconductor business. In a reversal of past practice, Intel will begin unbundling semiconductor design from semiconductor manufacturing, and outsourcing more of its chip production abroad. Today, Intel further refined its plans to increase output both in-house and otherwise, and investors applauded.
Intel stock is up 5.5% in response (as of 1:50 p.m. EST).

So what
So what exactly is Intel doing? As DIGITIMES reports, the company has recently invested $475 million in Intel Products Vietnam. Added to the $1 billion already invested in ""a state-of-the-art chip assembly and test manufacturing facility in Saigon Hi-Tech Park,"" this takes Intel's investment in Vietnam to nearly $1.5 billion.
The investment, reports the tech news source, is specifically designed to increase manufacturing of ""Intel's 5G products, Intel Core processors with Intel Hybrid Technology and 10th Gen Intel Core processors."" And by upping its investment nearly 50%, it can be anticipated that Intel Products Vietnam will be able to increase its output beyond the ""more than two billion units"" shipped from the facility in 2020.
Now what
Granted, this is an output increase in just one Intel facility within a global semiconductor manufacturing network. Still, it makes the network as a whole a bit more diversified. And the size of the investment seems substantial even in the context of Intel's capital spending budget that ordinarily stretches into the teens of billions of dollars every year (according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence). It could well be enough to move the needle on analysts' anticipated 7.5% annual earnings growth rate for Intel.
And in the further context of a stock that costs only 11.5 times trailing earnings, and that still pays a 2.6% dividend, it's a good reason to think Intel stock just became a bit more valuable today -- maybe even 5.5% more valuable.

The clarity on the political front appeared to buoy sentiment, as the Democrats gained a slim majority in Congress following the Georgia runoff elections. The Biden Administration will be able to cater to its progressive base, now that it rests on majorities – however thin – in both Houses of Congress.
Second, the end of the corona crisis may be heaving into sight. The vaccination programs are proceeding, and while it’s not as fast as was first hoped, the numbers of vaccinated people will only increase, and that’s a good thing.
Which brings us to the third point, and perhaps the most important. Some of the major ‘blue states’ have started easing their lockdown policies – notably, California and New York. This bodes will for the economy as a whole, and gives markets a sense that, with a vaccinated population and a reopened business sphere, we may get back to normal by the last month of 2021.
And that has the best analysts on Wall Street looking for stocks to buy. But which stocks exactly? We’ve opened up the TipRanks database to find out. They’re a fascinating blend of tech-related companies. Let's take a closer look.
Intel Corporation (INTC)
We’ll start in the semiconductor industry. The chip companies are looking at a whirlwind combination of related headwinds and tailwinds in the year ahead. They faced serious production declines during the ‘corona year,’ as reduced demand and stay-at-home policies kept fab plants idle – and now, everyone, it seems, needs semiconductor chips. The PC and gaming console sectors are ramping up, and their demand is rising, but the automotive industry can’t get enough chips to keep their own factories running at capacity. As for the chip companies, they are doing their best, but getting their production facilities back to full speed to meet growing demand may take as long as 6 to 9 months.
With that in mind, we can expect that the chip with the largest existing networks will be best able to meet the challenges. Intel, which has for years been ranked among the three largest chip companies in the world, is clearly in that league.
The company finished 2020 with $77.9 billion in total revenue, up 8% year-over-year and the fifth consecutive year of record sales. The company generated $35.4 billion in cash from operations, of which $21.1 billion was free cash flow, and was able to return $19.8 billion to its shareholders.
Intel managed that even as its stock price was highly volatile during the year. The company consistently beat expectations in 2020, but production bottlenecks and weakened demand put headwinds in the way of share appreciation.
Covering Intel for Needham, 5-star analyst Quinn Bolton, rated by TipRanks as the #1 Wall Street analyst, believes that Intel has better days ahead.
Noting the company’s progress, Bolton wrote: “We believe Intel will outsource some advanced manufacturing to TSMC, thereby reducing its capital intensity, improving free cash flow and improving shareholder returns. Further, we think Intel plans to protect its share in DCG from AMD by competing more on price while regaining its technological leadership with 7nm. While likely a drag on GM, we believe Intel's recent success in improving its GM through divesting lower-margin businesses and gradually improving 10nm cost savings can help partially offset the GM pressures from more competitive pricing. Lastly, we believe a low valuation relative to peers suggest upside in INTC shares.”
Bolton’s belief in a strong year ahead is clear from his Buy rating and $70 price target on the stock. At current levels, that target implies an upside of ~31% for the year ahead. (To watch Bolton’s track record, click here)
Granted, not everyone is as enthusiastic about the chip giant as Bolton. INTC has a Hold consensus rating based on 11 Buy ratings, 12 Holds and 8 Sells. The average price target, however, stands at $62.31 and implies ~16% upside from that level. (See INTC stock analysis on TipRanks)
HubSpot (HUBS)
Next up, HubSpot, has made its name in tech as an innovator, specifically for its inbound marketing software products. HubSpot has made the lives of SEO optimizers, social media marketers, CRM experts, and content managers easier with products ranging from web analytics to software integration. The company has operated since its 2006 founding on the freemium model, by which customers can access basic services without charge, while keeping the option of buying a paid subscription for higher-level services and regular upgrades.
2020 was a good year for HubSpot, as the company is perfectly positioned to gain from an increase in remote office work and telecommuting. The company saw its revenue hit $228.4 million in 3Q20, the last quarter for which numbers are available, for a 32% year-over-year gain. That figure was driven by subscription revenue of $221.1 million, which was also up 32% yoy.
The #2 analyst in TipRanks database, Brent Bracelin of Piper Sandler, cast his eye on HubSpot, and the cloud software sector generally.
Of the cloud business, at the macro level, Bracelin says, “Coming off a record year for cloud software driven by an unprecedented digital awakening that propelled sector-wide valuations, including a doubling of our 2020 top picks, the 2021 setup gets trickier. Robust digital tailwinds are reflected in near peak valuation multiples with the road to recovery and cyclical rotation fears tempering further upside.”
Turning to HubSpot, the analyst lists the company as one of his ‘highest conviction cloud stocks for 2021.’
“HubSpot has a long runway to sustain high growth considering it has just 3% penetration (95K+ customers) across a global customer TAM in excess of 3 million,"" Bracelin opined. ""Untapped cross-sell opportunity across new CMS and Sales Hubs give us an upward bias to consensus estimates of 22% growth next year.""
To this end, Bracelin rates HUBS shares an Overweight (i.e. Buy), along with a $488 price target. This figure suggests a 39% upside for the coming year. (To watch Bracelin’s track record, click here)
Bracelin is certainly not the first analyst with an optimistic outlook for the software player, as TipRanks analytics showcasing HUBS stock as a Strong Buy. With an average price target of $411.93, analysts see ~18% growth for the stock. In total, the stock has received 12 Buy ratings vs. 4 Holds. (See HUBS stock analysis on TipRanks)
Peloton Interactive (PTON)
Last but not least is Peloton, the upscale maker of network-connected home exercise equipment. The company’s exercise bikes can be used independently, but the big sell is their online connectivity – users can link to each other, to classes, to instructors, or just download music and other content to make stationary spinning easier on the mind. Peloton has successfully integrated the world of smart apps with home exercise equipment.
Creating a niche – defining the customer and developing a product that meets that customer’s needs – can be a path to success if done well, and Peloton has executed well. The company’s success can be seen by the share performance in 2020; up an impressive 434%.
The share gains have paralleled the company’s revenues – sales have grown in the five consecutive reported quarters since the September 2019 IPO. The most recent, 3Q20, was the company’s first of fiscal year 2021, and saw revenue beat expectations. The top line showed at $757.9 million, up an impressive 232% year-over-year. The company bumped up its 2021 revenue guidance to $3.9 billion.
While sales and share performance are strong, Peloton has been struggling with supply and delivery issues. The company’s growth has been far faster than was previously expected, and Peloton has experienced difficulties maintaining the supply chain to its manufacturing facilities and delivering customer orders efficiently.
In a move that may address the supply and delivery matter, Peloton announced a $420 million deal to acquire Precor, a supplier of exercise equipment in the gym and hotel market. The move will give Peloton access to Precor’s existing manufacturing facilities in North Carolina and Washington State. These facilities total 625,000 square feet, and will give needed bulk to Peloton’s logistic capabilities.
Oppenheimer analyst Jason Helfstein, rated #3 overall by TipRanks, sees two main points leading to further success: first, Peloton’s ability to scoop up new subscribers from gym cancellations, and second, the Precor merger.
“[We] project ~9% churn rate in overall US gym memberships, with Peloton acquiring 600K Connected Fitness Subscribers ahead of the company's pre-COVID forecast. The 600K subscribers represents 12.6% of an estimated 4.4M gym membership cancellations… In our view, investors will focus on the acquisition alleviating supply constraints in the near-term. However, we see real value in the transaction creating upmarket/up-selling possibilities for Peloton, as Precor has 124K connected fitness devices across 11K facilities worldwide,"" Helfstein commented.
Helfstein rates PTON shares an Outperform (i.e. Buy), and sets a $185 price target that suggests a ~28% one-year upside. (To watch Helfstein’s track record, click here)
All in all, with 22 recent analyst reviews, breaking down to 19 Buys, 2 Holds, and 1 Sell, Peloton has a Strong Buy rating from the analyst consensus. Meanwhile, the average price target of $157.58 leaves room for ~9% growth from the current share price of $144.96. (See PTON stock analysis on TipRanks)

2021-01-27 00:00:00+00:00,"Apple tops Wall Street expectations on record iPhone revenue, China sales surge",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/apple-tops-wall-street-expectations-on-record-iphone-revenue-china-sales-surge-2021-01-0,,,"By Stephen Nellis
Jan 27 (Reuters) - Apple Inc AAPL.O on Wednesday reported holiday quarter sales and profits that beat Wall Street expectations, as new 5G iPhones helped push handset revenue to a new record and sparked a 57% rise in China sales.
Apple shipped its iPhone 12 lineup several weeks later than usual, but an expanded number of models and new look appear to have tapped into pent up demand for upgrades, especially in China. The company also posted strong sales of its Mac laptops and iPads in the quarter, driven by consumers working, learning and playing from home during the pandemic.
Apple's revenue for the quarter ended Dec. 26 rose 21% to $111.44 billion. Earnings per share rose to $1.68 from $1.25. Analysts had expected $103.28 billion and $1.41 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Sales of iPhones were $65.60 billion, compared with estimates of $59.80 billion and beating Apple's previous quarterly all-time high of $61.58 billion in iPhone sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2018. (Graphic: https://tmsnrt.rs/2Mwb7Tr)
Shares of Apple were down slightly in after-hours trade following the report but have risen nearly 12% since Jan. 15. The results come as investors have spent the past year rethinking Apple's valuation. Apple's shares often traded at lower price-to-earnings ratios than its rivals due to Apple's dependence on the iPhone. But those ratios have risen over the past year, as have valuations of other major tech firms.
Apple, the biggest U.S. listed public company by market capitalization with a value of $2.4 trillion, has thrived through a pandemic that forced it to shutter many of its stores but prompted many consumers to buy or upgrade devices.
Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook told Reuters in an interview that the company now has an active installed base of 1.65 billion devices, compared with 1.5 billion devices a year ago. Cook also said Apple now has an installed base of more than 1 billion iPhones, an increase over the 900 million the company most recently disclosed in 2019.
The pandemic's travel restrictions disrupted Apple's product development cycle, with a late launch of its 5G devices temporarily wiping as much as $100 billion from its market capitalization in October.
But even then, Cook and others were optimistic that the phones would become strong sellers, citing early sales data in China. The prediction proved correct, with fiscal first-quarter sales in China rising 57% to $21.31 billion, compared with $13.58 billion a year earlier.
""We had two of the top three selling smartphones in urban China,"" Cook told Reuters in an interview, adding that many of the company's other products and services also sold well. Cook said that Apple gained iPhone sales in China both from customers switching from rival Android devices as well as existing customers upgrading devices, but said ""upgraders in particular set an all-time record in China.""
Mac sales reached $8.68 billion, in line with analyst expectations of $8.69 billion. Apple in November released its first laptop and desktop computers with processor chips of its own design, breaking a nearly 15-year partnership with Intel Corp INTC.O.
Sales of iPads were $8.44 billion compared with analyst expectations of $7.46 billion.
Cook told Reuters that sales of Macs, iPads and the iPhone 12 Pro model all ran into ""supply constraints."" He said that ""semiconductors are very tight"" but that other areas of the supply chain contributed to the constraints as well.
The company's services business, which includes its new Apple One bundle of television, music and cloud storage services, had $15.76 billion in revenue, compared with analyst estimates of $14.80 billion.
Cook told Reuters that Apple has 620 million paying subscribers on its platform, ahead of its goal to have 600 million subscribers by the end of 2020.
The services segment also includes sales from Apple's App Store, whose billing practices have become a flashpoint of conflict with ""Fortnite"" creator Epic Games and whose privacy rules have ticked off a public spat with Facebook Inc FB.O.
Apple's wearables and accessories segment, which includes the Apple Watch and AirPods product lines, hit $12.97 billion in revenue, versus analyst estimates of $11.96 billion. Apple in December released the AirPods Max, a $550 set of over-ear wireless headphones, with shipment dates stretching months into the future within hours of the product's launch. Cook said short supplies of the AirPods Max could continue into the company's current fiscal second quarter.
Apple on Wednesday also declared a dividend of 20.5 cents per share. Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri told Reuters that relative weakness in the value of the U.S. dollar added about 100 basis points to Apple's fiscal first-quarter revenue but did not have an impact on the company's gross margins.

2021-01-27 00:00:00+00:00,Intel Still Thinks It Can Keep Pace With TSMC and AMD,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intel-still-thinks-it-can-keep-pace-with-tsmc-and-amd-2021-01-27,,,"Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) recently posted its fourth-quarter earnings, and the chipmaker's stock price initially rallied after the results. Its revenue dipped 1% year over year to $26.0 billion, but it beat estimates by $2.5 billion. Its adjusted earnings stayed flat at $1.52 per share, but it also cleared expectations by $0.41.
For the first quarter, Intel expects its adjusted revenue to decline 12% year over year to $17.5 billion, which surpasses analysts' expectations, and for its adjusted EPS to drop 24%, which matches expectations.
Those numbers seemed to calm investors, but Intel's stock price still fell after incoming CEO Pat Gelsinger declared he was ""confident that the majority of our 2023 products will be manufactured internally"" during the conference call. However, Gelsinger said Intel would still ""likely"" expand its usage of ""external foundries for certain technologies and products.""
Image source: Intel.
In other words, Intel won't outsource the production of its main CPUs to external foundries like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) anytime soon, but it could let TSMC or other foundries manufacture its discrete GPUs and other chips. That's a bold statement -- but can Intel catch up to TSMC and its big customers like Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD)?
What happened to Intel?
Intel still manufactures its own chips with its in-house foundry. This makes it different from ""fabless"" chipmakers like AMD, NVIDIA, and Qualcomm, which outsource the capital-intensive manufacturing process to major foundries like TSMC, GlobalFoundries, or Samsung.
The number of chip foundries across the world has steadily declined over the past few decades, due to the high costs and technical expertise required to produce smaller and more powerful chips. TSMC, the world's largest contract chipmaker, is now the leader in this ""process race,"" which is measured in ever-shrinking nanometers.
Intel once kept pace with TSMC in the process race with a two year ""tick-tock"" cycle for chip upgrades. In each ""tick"" year, Intel would introduce a smaller node. In each ""tock"" year, it would upgrade the chip's architecture, but the size would remain the same.
But under former CEO Brian Krzanich, who led Intel from 2013 to 2018, that two-year cycle expanded. Intel's foundry struggled to jump from 14nm to 10nm chips, and that failure caused a CPU shortage that allowed AMD to pull PC makers away from Intel. Under Bob Swan, who succeeded Krzanich after his abrupt resignation, Intel struggled to resolve that shortage, and fumbled its transition from 10nm to 7nm chips.
As a result, Intel's foundry has now fallen a full generation behind TSMC, which continues to produce AMD's latest CPUs. In December, Swan said Intel could possibly outsource its chips to TSMC, and would make a final decision in January.
Can Intel catch up to TSMC?
Intel has repeatedly argued that its current-generation 10nm chips are comparable to TSMC's 7nm chips in terms of transistor density. But that point could soon be moot as TSMC advances to even smaller nodes.
Image source: Getty images.
TSMC started mass producing 5nm chips last year, and it plans to mass produce 3nm chips in 2022. To maintain that lead, it will spend $25 billion to $28 billion on capex this year, up from $17.2 billion in 2020.
Under Swan, Intel actually reduced its capex -- from $16.2 billion in 2019 to $14.3 billion in 2020 -- even as it struggled with R&D and manufacturing issues. Swan, who has a financial background rather than an engineering one, also prioritized cost-cutting measures, buybacks, and divestments instead of resolving Intel's most pressing issues.
Gelsinger -- who was once Intel's chief technology officer and the architect of the original Intel 80486 processor -- is certainly better qualified to fix Intel's manufacturing issues than Swan. But that turnaround will require an enormous boost to its capex this year, and Intel's management didn't provide any specific capex guidance during its conference call.
Instead, Gelsinger expressed his confidence in Intel maintaining its in-house manufacturing, and said he was ""pleased with the progress made on the health and recovery of the 7-nanometer program.""
Gelsinger didn't disclose which of the company's non-core chips would be outsourced, but they'll likely include its new discrete GPUs. Other potential candidates include Altera's FPGAs (field-programmable gate arrays), Mobileye's automotive chips, and its Internet of Things chips.
Does Intel's strategy make sense?
Gelsinger likely believes outsourcing the production of its x86 CPUs to TSMC would make it tougher to differentiate its chips from AMD's, since they'll be manufactured on the same process. It could also permanently prevent Intel from moving ahead of AMD as it did throughout AMD's disastrous ""Bulldozer"" era, which preceded its current-gen ""Zen"" chips.
That commitment is admirable, but Intel must increase its capex significantly this year if it wants to catch up to TSMC. Therefore, investors shouldn't be surprised if Intel's earnings -- which are already expected to drop 10% this year -- decline more than expected. In short, investors should expect a lot of short-term pain as Intel sacrifices its profits to fix its business -- but those sacrifices could pay off over the long run.

STOCKHOLM, Jan 26 (Reuters) - Automotive technology firm Veoneer VNE.N, VNEsdb.ST and U.S. chip giant Qualcomm QCOM.O have signed a collaboration deal to develop a software and chip platform for advanced driver assistance systems, Veoneer said on Tuesday.
The companies first communicated their plans to team up in August last year, and their joint platform will seek to rival companies such as Intel's Mobileye INTC.O
Veoneer, which also makes radars and vision systems, said it had formed Arriver, a dedicated software unit for the development of the complete perception and drive policy software stack.
""Today's agreement with Qualcomm Technologies and the creation of Arriver are key milestones in Veoneer's development,"" Veoneer CEO Jan Carlson said in a statement.
Veoneer shares, which have more than doubled since the preliminary plans with Qualcomm were first announced, rose 2.8% in early Stockholm trading on Tuesday.
Veoneer said that Arriver software is already functional on Qualcomm's Snapdragon Ride Platform, ""which will be available for automotive customers in coming months"".
Sweden-based Veoneer said the collaboration between the companies had been presented to a number of car makers and Tier-1 automotive suppliers with very positive feedback to the intended specifications and capabilities of the platform.
Veoneer will own 100% of Arriver, but the unit will operate under specific information handling protocols and reporting structures as part of its collaboration with Qualcomm Technologies, it said.

2021-01-26 00:00:00+00:00,Intel Named Top Dividend Stock With Insider Buying and 2.51% Yield (INTC),INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intel-named-top-dividend-stock-with-insider-buying-and-2.51-yield-intc-2021-01-26,,,"In this series, we look through the most recent Dividend Channel ''DividendRank'' report, and then we cherry pick only those companies that have experienced insider buying within the past six months. The officers and directors of a company tend to have a unique insider's view of the business, and presumably the only reason an insider would choose to take their hard-earned cash and use it to buy stock in the open market, is that they expect to make money — maybe they find the stock very undervalued, or maybe they see exciting progress within the company, or maybe both. So when stocks turn up that see insider buying, and are also top ranked, investors are wise to take notice. One such company is Intel Corp (Symbol: INTC), which saw buying by CEO Robert Holmes Swan.
Back on October 28, Swan invested $360,624.16 into 8,021 shares of INTC, for a cost per share of $44.96. In trading on Tuesday, shares were changing hands as low as $54.85 per share, which is 22.0% above Swan's purchase price. It should be noted that Swan has collected $0.33/share in dividends since the time of their purchase, so they are currently up 22.7% on their purchase from a total return basis. Intel Corp shares are currently trading +0.15% on the day. The chart below shows the one year performance of INTC shares, versus its 200 day moving average:
Looking at the chart above, INTC's low point in its 52 week range is $43.61 per share, with $68.09 as the 52 week high point — that compares with a last trade of $55.55. By comparison, below is a table showing the prices at which insider buying was recorded over the last six months:
PURCHASED INSIDER TITLE SHARES PRICE/SHARE VALUE
10/28/2020 Robert Holmes Swan CEO 8,021 $44.96 $360,624.16
The DividendRank report noted that among the coverage universe, INTC shares displayed both attractive valuation metrics and strong profitability metrics. The report also cited the strong quarterly dividend history at Intel Corp, and favorable long-term multi-year growth rates in key fundamental data points.
The report stated, ''Dividend investors approaching investing from a value standpoint are generally most interested in researching the strongest most profitable companies, that also happen to be trading at an attractive valuation. That's what we aim to find using our proprietary DividendRank formula, which ranks the coverage universe based upon our various criteria for both profitability and valuation, to generate a list of the top most 'interesting' stocks, meant for investors as a source of ideas that merit further research.''
The annualized dividend paid by Intel Corp is $1.39/share, currently paid in quarterly installments, and its most recent dividend ex-date was on 02/05/2021. Below is a long-term dividend history chart for INTC, which the report stressed as being of key importance. Indeed, studying a company's past dividend history can be of good help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue.

2021-01-26 00:00:00+00:00,"Earnings Beat: Intel Corporation Just Beat Analyst Forecasts, And Analysts Have Been Updating Their Models",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/earnings-beat%3A-intel-corporation-just-beat-analyst-forecasts-and-analysts-have-been,,,"Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) just released its annual report and things are looking bullish. The company beat expectations with revenues of US$78b arriving 3.3% ahead of forecasts. Statutory earnings per share (EPS) were US$4.94, 8.3% ahead of estimates. This is an important time for investors, as they can track a company's performance in its report, look at what experts are forecasting for next year, and see if there has been any change to expectations for the business. Readers will be glad to know we've aggregated the latest statutory forecasts to see whether the analysts have changed their mind on Intel after the latest results.
NasdaqGS:INTC Earnings and Revenue Growth January 26th 2021
Following the recent earnings report, the consensus from 32 analysts covering Intel is for revenues of US$73.4b in 2021, implying a perceptible 5.8% decline in sales compared to the last 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are expected to fall 10% to US$4.46 in the same period. Yet prior to the latest earnings, the analysts had been anticipated revenues of US$71.3b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$4.36 in 2021. It looks like there's been a modest increase in sentiment following the latest results, withthe analysts becoming a bit more optimistic in their predictions for both revenues and earnings.
With these upgrades, we're not surprised to see that the analysts have lifted their price target 7.1% to US$62.59per share. It could also be instructive to look at the range of analyst estimates, to evaluate how different the outlier opinions are from the mean. Currently, the most bullish analyst values Intel at US$90.00 per share, while the most bearish prices it at US$40.00. This is a fairly broad spread of estimates, suggesting that analysts are forecasting a wide range of possible outcomes for the business.
Of course, another way to look at these forecasts is to place them into context against the industry itself. We would highlight that sales are expected to reverse, with the forecast 5.8% revenue decline a notable change from historical growth of 7.3% over the last five years. By contrast, our data suggests that other companies (with analyst coverage) in the same industry are forecast to see their revenue grow 9.9% annually for the foreseeable future. It's pretty clear that Intel's revenues are expected to perform substantially worse than the wider industry.
The Bottom Line
The biggest takeaway for us is the consensus earnings per share upgrade, which suggests a clear improvement in sentiment around Intel's earnings potential next year. They also upgraded their revenue estimates for next year, even though sales are expected to grow slower than the wider industry. We note an upgrade to the price target, suggesting that the analysts believes the intrinsic value of the business is likely to improve over time.
Following on from that line of thought, we think that the long-term prospects of the business are much more relevant than next year's earnings. We have forecasts for Intel going out to 2025, and you can see them free on our platform here.
You should always think about risks though. Case in point, we've spotted 2 warning signs for Intel you should be aware of, and 1 of them is a bit concerning.

About James P. O'Shaughnessy: Research guru and money manager James O'Shaughnessy forced many professional and amateur investors alike to rethink their investment beliefs when he published his 1996 bestseller, What Works on Wall Street. O'Shaughnessy back-tested 44 years ofstock market datafrom the comprehensive Standard & Poor's Compustat database to find out which quantitative strategies have worked over the years and which haven't. To the surprise of many, he concluded that price/earnings ratios aren't the best indicator of a stock's value, and that small-company stocks, contrary to popular wisdom, don't as a group have an edge on large-company stocks.
