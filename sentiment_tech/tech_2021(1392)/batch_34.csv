April 20 (Reuters) - Futures pointed to a lower open for Wall Street's main indexes on Tuesday as investors banked on results from Netflix and other major technology-related companies this week to sustain the positive start to the earnings season.
Streaming service provider Netflix NFLX.O, which thrived during last year's lockdowns, will be the first among the so called FAANG group to report quarterly numbers. Its shares slipped about 0.3% in pre-market trading, ahead of its results after markets close.
International Business Machines Corp IBM.N rose 2.7% as it recorded the biggest rise in quarterly sales in more than two years, boosted by its bets on the high-margin cloud computing business.
Chipmaker Intel Corp INTC.O is slated to report results on Thursday.
""We are getting a little bit of weakness ... even though the earnings and economic data is good,"" said Ryan Detrick, senior market strategist at LPL Financial in Charlotte, North Carolina.
""The underlying fundamentals are extremely strong and it wouldn't be overly concerning after the rally we have seen in the past 13 months for the market to catch its breath a little bit more in the face of strong earnings.""
After blockbuster earnings from major U.S. banks last week, analysts expect first-quarter profit for overall S&P 500 firms to jump 30.9% from a year earlier, according to Refinitiv IBES data.
A pullback in longer-dated bond yields from 14-month highs has eased worries over higher borrowing costs, reviving demand for richly valued technology stocks.
Also, a string of robust economic data and expectations of a strong rebound in corporate earnings helped the S&P 500 and the Dow to hit record highs last week.
At 08:32 a.m. ET, Dow E-minis 1YMcv1 were down 154 points, or 0.45%, S&P 500 E-minis EScv1 were down 18 points, or 0.43% and Nasdaq 100 E-minis NQcv1 were down 48.75 points, or 0.35%.
Tobacco companies, including Altria Group MO.N and Philip Morris PM.N, fell as much as 4.2% after the Wall Street Journal reported that the Biden administration is considering a rule that would limit nicotine or ban menthol in cigarettes.
Abbott Laboratories ABT.N fell 3%, despite posting a three-fold jump in quarterly profit.
Nike Inc NKE.N dropped about 1.6% after Citigroup lowered its rating on the company's shares to ""neutral"" from ""buy"".

April 20 (Reuters) - Apple Inc AAPL.O is expected to unveil a new podcast subscription service and finally may show off tiny tags meant to locate lost items at a virtual event Tuesday that likely will feature new iPads and Mac computers.
Apple shares have risen nearly 95% over the past year, faster than the 64% rise in the Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC, thanks to a record $274.5 billion in sales for fiscal 2020 as consumers stocked up on electronics during the pandemic.
Macs and iPads accounted for $52.3 billion during its fiscal 2020, and analysts expect updates to the top-end iPad Pro models on Tuesday, including better display and processing technology.
“The Pro iPads are not the volume sellers, but they blur the line between Mac and iPad. How Apple differentiates between the iPad Pro and the Mac will be very interesting to watch,"" Ben Bajarin, principal analyst for consumer market intelligence at Creative Strategies.
Analysts also expect Apple to take aim at podcasts, which have become a focus for its streaming music rival Spotify Technology SA SPOT.N, with a subscription service.
Apple may also release tracking devices called AirTags that would use the same technology that helps Apple customers locate lost phones and ear buds to locate lost wallets or keys.
The release could result in a new round of complaints to lawmakers that Apple is hurting smaller rivals. Tile, a startup that has sold a competing tracker for nearly a decade, last year testified before the U.S. House of Representatives that Apple's App Store rules had made it harder to use Tile's products and will be called before the U.S. Senate to testify on Wednesday.
Apple has said it subjects all apps, including its own, to the same App Store review rules.
Bob O'Donnell, head of TECHnalysis Research, said he does not believe the trackers will become a big business on their own. ""Because they are so late to this, it might not be that much different than when Apple got into set top boxes like Apple TV. They’re a player. They’re there, but they're not huge,"" he said.
But Bajarin said the trackers could keep people tied to their iPhones if they rely on them to find items like keys and wallets.
""The more you buy into just one hardware product, the less likely it is you’ll ever leave,"" Bajarin said.
O'Donnell said other announcements could include Apple moving some of its iMac models to its own processors from Intel Corp's INTC.O chips; and a consumer computer monitor in a lineup that recently has only had a high-priced screen for video professionals.

NEW YORK, April 19 (Reuters) - On the heels of blockbuster earnings from major U.S. banks, investors are focused on whether an upcoming batch of earnings from major technology-related companies can sustain the season's early momentum.
Estimated year-over-year first-quarter earnings growth for S&P 500 companies rose to 31% from 25% in the past week, based on Refinitiv data, driven by last week's stronger-than-expected results from Wells Fargo & Co , Goldman Sachs Group Inc and other banks.
Tuesday brings results from stay-at-home winner Netflix Inc , which is part of the FAANG group of high-profile tech-related names. Chipmaker Intel Corp's results are due later this week.
After the bell Monday, shares of International Business Machines Corp were up more than 2% as the company resumed sales growth in the first quarter after a year of declines and beat Wall Street targets.
Earnings for the technology sector , which continued to grow last year while S&P 500 overall earnings dropped as the pandemic took its toll on businesses and consumers, are on track for 25% year-over-year growth in the first quarter.
But this year, tech is expected to lag profit growth of sectors that should benefit from the reopening of the economy, such as financials.
First-quarter profit growth for the S&P 500 financials sector , is now estimated at 116%, compared with 76% a week earlier.
""Every time we go to earnings, there's always the question of whether (tech) can keep delivering, especially in terms of guidance,"" said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial in Newark, New Jersey.
""And they have,"" she said. ""What you are seeing is investors are prepared to have them - or some of them - in their portfolios along with cyclicals.""
To be sure, many strategists have been bullish on economically focused sectors, and U.S. technology and growth stocks have recently begun to gain again after months of being outpaced by economically sensitive names that appear to be a better value.
Netflix still lags the broader market. Its stock is up 2.5% so far in 2021 after gaining 67% in 2020, when consumers embraced at-home entertainment during the early pandemic lockdowns, but some analysts are optimistic Netflix's strong run is not over.
""It is reasonable to anticipate reduced engagement on the platform as the global economy reopens,"" Brian White, an internet and software analyst at Monness Crespi Hardt who recommends buying the stock, wrote in a recent note.
""However, this crisis has acted as a catalyst in introducing more consumers to the service and we believe this story has a long runway of growth in the coming years.""
The current cycle of rising chip demand is expected to help semiconductors, said Daniel Morgan, senior portfolio manager at Synovus Trust Company.
""Semiconductors are operating on all cylinders right now. They can't make them fast enough,"" he said.
Micron Technology Inc shares rose when it forecast quarterly revenue above Wall Street estimates due to a rise in demand for memory chips, thanks to 5G smartphones and artificial intelligence software.
As companies have more money to increase their technology spending, that will support tech companies as well.
""With tech, either way they win. They're really in a great position right now,"" Morgan said.
Microsoft Corp is expected to report April 27.
Rounding out the FAANG reports, Google parent Alphabet Inc , Apple Inc , Facebook Inc and Amazon.com Inc also are due to report results later this month.

April 19 (Reuters) - Major U.S. stock indexes fell from record levels on Monday as investors sought cues from first-quarter earnings reports to justify the rich valuation of equities, while Tesla shares fell following a fatal car crash.

The stock, which was the biggest drag on the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq, was also under pressure due to a sharp drop in bitcoin BTC=BTSP over the weekend.

2021-04-19 00:00:00+00:00,Why Intel Investors Should Worry About NVIDIA's New Data Center Chips,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-intel-investors-should-worry-about-nvidias-new-data-center-chips-2021-04-19,,,"Even after some chip fabrication stumbles and falling behind some of its peers technologically, Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) remains by far the world's largest semiconductor company as measured by revenue. It hauled in a massive $77.9 billion in sales in 2020, an 8% year-over-year increase. With a global semiconductor shortage expected to last for the foreseeable future, Intel has said it will double down on its manufacturing and build a couple of new factories in Arizona.
A sea change is starting in the industry, though. NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) is flexing its muscles and announced at its investor day last week that it's prepping a new data-center processor aimed at one of Intel's tentpole businesses. As computing needs quickly evolve, NVIDIA is on a path to industry domination.
The NVIDIA Grace CPU for data centers. Image source: NVIDIA.
New processors for a new era of AI
NVIDIA has picked up serious momentum in recent years designing GPUs (graphics processing units) into data centers as computing accelerators. A GPU's strength is in its ability to break down large and complex tasks into smaller parts and compute them in parallel. This makes them ideal for high-performance computing like training artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms, which require that massive amounts of data be worked through.
As a result, NVIDIA has been picking off chunks of data center market share as its GPUs get added to the general-purpose CPUs (central processing units) that dominate the space currently.
To be sure, CPUs will remain an essential part of data centers, which are massive and complex computing units, and CPUs will handle basic tasks like pulling information from memory banks and coordinating the movement of data. This is the realm Intel has dominated for decades. Its data center group (DCG) reported sales of $26.1 billion last year, accounting for one-third of total revenue. All by itself, Intel's DCG dwarfs NVIDIA's total revenue of $16.7 billion last year.
But NVIDIA isn't content to just add its GPUs to data centers. It's coming for Intel's bread-and-butter CPU market share. It indicated as much with its pending acquisition of chip architecture designer ARM Holdings. And at its investor day, NVIDIA announced it's directly entering the data center CPU market with Grace, a high-performance CPU based on ARM chip designs that will be available in 2023. Interestingly, NVIDIA is also planning to sell Grace on a single circuit board with its GPUs, connecting the two with networking tech it picked up from its Mellanox acquisition last year.
Intel is gearing up for expansion of its in-house manufacturing, but NVIDIA could put a damper on those efforts by seriously raising the bar in chip performance.
A more modern operating model
Granted, NVIDIA doesn't fabricate its own chips. It simply designs them and outsources manufacturing to the likes of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) -- which incidentally surpassed Intel's chip fab size a couple of years back and currently boasts 57% of global chip-manufacturing market share. Given this operating model, NVIDIA's design house isn't going to surpass Intel's integrated design and fabrication business in terms of sales anytime soon.
Nevertheless, NVIDIA Grace could be just the first shot across Intel's bow as it seeks to scoop up more chunks of the modern data center's construction. Computing needs are rapidly evolving, and cloud computing is putting the power of entire AI systems at the fingertips of users working from PCs, laptops, and mobile devices. NVIDIA is purpose-building its suite of hardware for this growing demand, helping it leapfrog Intel technologically and confirming its spot at the table in a few years.
Again, Grace won't start selling until 2023 (NVIDIA said it will use these chips internally for now in its own private servers), but Intel has nevertheless been put on notice. When it comes time to upgrade CPUs, customers will soon have a new option that integrates seamlessly with the GPUs they've already started installing in recent years.
NVIDIA's biggest end-market remains video games, but its second-largest data center vertical is only just getting started. Intel has the most to lose, and NVIDIA's tech is already the name to beat. The winds of change are blowing strongly in the latter's favor.

2021-04-19 00:00:00+00:00,PREVIEW-Investors turn to growth stocks' results after strong earnings start,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/preview-investors-turn-to-growth-stocks-results-after-strong-earnings-start-2021-04-19,,,"(Updates with IBM results after the bell, Netflix's YTD gain)
By Caroline Valetkevitch
NEW YORK, April 19 (Reuters) - On the heels of blockbuster earnings from major U.S. banks, investors are focused on whether an upcoming batch of earnings from major technology-related companies can sustain the season's early momentum.
Estimated year-over-year first-quarter earnings growth for S&P 500 companies rose to 31% from 25% in the past week, based on Refinitiv data, driven by last week's stronger-than-expected results from Wells Fargo & Co , Goldman Sachs Group Inc and other banks.
Tuesday brings results from stay-at-home winner Netflix Inc , which is part of the FAANG group of high-profile tech-related names. Chipmaker Intel Corp's results are due later this week.
After the bell Monday, shares of International Business Machines Corp were up more than 2% as the company resumed sales growth in the first quarter after a year of declines and beat Wall Street targets.
Earnings for the technology sector , which continued to grow last year while S&P 500 overall earnings dropped as the pandemic took its toll on businesses and consumers, are on track for 25% year-over-year growth in the first quarter.
But this year, tech is expected to lag profit growth of sectors that should benefit from the reopening of the economy, such as financials.
First-quarter profit growth for the S&P 500 financials sector , is now estimated at 116%, compared with 76% a week earlier.
""Every time we go to earnings, there's always the question of whether (tech) can keep delivering, especially in terms of guidance,"" said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial in Newark, New Jersey.
""And they have,"" she said. ""What you are seeing is investors are prepared to have them - or some of them - in their portfolios along with cyclicals.""
To be sure, many strategists have been bullish on economically focused sectors, and U.S. technology and growth stocks have recently begun to gain again after months of being outpaced by economically sensitive names that appear to be a better value.
Netflix still lags the broader market. Its stock is up 2.5% so far in 2021 after gaining 67% in 2020, when consumers embraced at-home entertainment during the early pandemic lockdowns, but some analysts are optimistic Netflix's strong run is not over.
""It is reasonable to anticipate reduced engagement on the platform as the global economy reopens,"" Brian White, an internet and software analyst at Monness Crespi Hardt who recommends buying the stock, wrote in a recent note.
""However, this crisis has acted as a catalyst in introducing more consumers to the service and we believe this story has a long runway of growth in the coming years.""
The current cycle of rising chip demand is expected to help semiconductors, said Daniel Morgan, senior portfolio manager at Synovus Trust Company.
""Semiconductors are operating on all cylinders right now. They can't make them fast enough,"" he said.
Micron Technology Inc shares rose when it forecast quarterly revenue above Wall Street estimates due to a rise in demand for memory chips, thanks to 5G smartphones and artificial intelligence software.
As companies have more money to increase their technology spending, that will support tech companies as well.
""With tech, either way they win. They're really in a great position right now,"" Morgan said.
Microsoft Corp is expected to report April 27.
Rounding out the FAANG reports, Google parent Alphabet Inc , Apple Inc , Facebook Inc and Amazon.com Inc also are due to report results later this month.

2021-04-19 00:00:00+00:00,Raymond James: 2 Chip Giants to Buy Now (And 1 to Avoid),INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/raymond-james%3A-2-chip-giants-to-buy-now-and-1-to-avoid-2021-04-19,,,"Semiconductors are one of the modern world’s essential industries, making possible so much of what we rely on or take for granted: internet access, high-speed computers with high-speed memory, even the thermostats that control our air conditioning – there isn’t much, tech-wise, that doesn’t use semiconductor chips.
The global semiconductor chip market was valued at over $513 billion in 2019, and despite the worst the pandemic could do, the chip sector rose to $726 billion in 2020. It’s a market based on a near-limitless customer base; it’s estimated that 2.5 billion people own at least one smartphone. That’s 1 in 3 of the total world population, enough to ensure that demand for semiconductor chips will never slacken.
And with that background, Raymond James analyst Chris Caso sees two chip giant poised to make gains this year – but one that investors should avoid. Let's take a closer look.
Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)
The first chip stock we’ll look at, AMD, is consistently ranked among the top 20 largest chip makers – by sales – globally. The company held the fifteenth spot last year, with $9.76 billion in total revenues. That top line was up 45% from 2019, when AMD was ranked eighteenth. AMD’s position in the industry is based on its high-quality products, including microprocessors, motherboard chipsets, and graphics processors. AMD’s Ryzen Mobile 4000 chip was the first 7nm x86 processor on the market.
The chip company showed a solid second half in 2020, with revenues in Q3 and Q4 rapidly recovering the 1H20 dip and rising above 2019 level. Earnings in Q4 skyrocketed, growing from Q3’s 32 cents per share to an impressive $1.45 per share. For all of 2020, earnings came in at $2.06, compared to 30 cents for 2019. The strong second half pushed the full-year revenue to a company record, on the strength of expanding demand in the PC, gaming, and data center markets.
AMD’s prospects have attracted Raymond James’ Chris Caso, who compares the company favorably to competitor Intel.
“We are using the pullback since the start of the year to get involved with AMD, which we expect to be a secular winner due to what we believe to be a durable technical advantage vs. Intel. We think the stock’s pullback has been driven by improved sentiment that Intel will solve their manufacturing challenges, which will reverse AMD’s successes. We’re taking the other side of that view,"" the 5-star analyst noted.
Caso continued, ""Nowthat Intel has committed to internal manufacturing, we think it’s unlikely that Intel ever regains a transistor advantage vs. AMD, and the current roadmaps ensure an advantage for AMD/TSMC through at least 2024. In the meantime, we think Street numbers are too low for both server and consoles, putting our base case 2022 EPS estimate of $2.81 12% ahead of the Street, with an upside case to about $3.00.""
In line with this outlook, Caso initiated coverage of AMD with an Outperform (i.e. Buy) rating, and $100 price target to suggest a 23% one-year upside potential. (To watch Caso’s track record, click here)
The Raymond James view is no bullish outlier; AMD has 13 positive reviews on record. These are partly balanced by 5 Holds and 1 Sell, making the analyst consensus rating a Moderate Buy. The share are selling for $81.11, and their $104.44 average price target implies an upside of ~29% for the next 12 months. (See AMD stock analysis on TipRanks)
Nvidia Corporation (NVDA)
Next up, Nvidia, is another of the chip industry’s giants. Like AMD, Nvidia is slowly rising in the rankings; going by total sales, the company was rated number 10 in 2019 – and number 8 in 2020. Nvidia’s sales last year totaled more than $16 billion, a gain of 53% year-over-year. Nvidia rode to its success on the combination of memory chips – which have a strong market in the data center segment – and graphics processors – which are popular among both hardcore gamers and professional graphic designers.
For the most recent quarter, Q4 of fiscal 2021, ending on December 31, Nvidia reported $5 billion in revenue, a company record, and a 61% gain from the year before. EPS rose from $1.53 in the prior Q4 to $2.31 in the current print, a gain of 51%. Full year numbers were strong; the $16.68 billion at the top line was a record, and the EPS, at $6.90, was 53% higher than the previous year.
Company management noted the strength of the data center segment, but also pointed out that Nvidia has a growing AI business. The company makes between 5% and 10% of its total sales in the automotive market, and more than half of that is AI-related, in the autonomous vehicle niche.
Raymond James’ Chris Caso notes this, too, in his report upgrading his stance on NVDA.
“Our call is not really new, as we’ve been positive on NVDA for some time. Our call rather is meant to express our conviction in both the short and long term. In the short term, we think NVDA results will be more dependent on supply than demand given widespread shortages – and we do expect incremental supply as the year progresses…. Our longer term conviction is driven by the fact that NVDA has more shots on goal than anyone else in our coverage, and their success in AI has earned them a permanent seat at the table in both hyperscale and enterprise compute,” Caso opined.
Caso bumps his stance up from Outperform to Strong Buy, and sets a price target of $750. At current levels, this indicates room for a 17% one-year upside.
NVDA’s strong share appreciation over the past 12 months (115%) has pushed the stock price close to the average price target. Shares are selling for $614.47, with an average target of $670.20 suggesting room for 9% growth. Nonetheless, the stock holds a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 22 Buys and 4 Hold given in recent weeks. (See NVDA stock analysis on TipRanks)
Intel Corporation (INTC)
The third stock we’re looking at, Intel, is the one that Raymond James says to avoid. This may seem counterintuitive; Intel is, by sales, the world’s largest semiconductor chip maker, with more than $77 billion in annual revenue last year and a leading position in a $720+ billion market. So why does Caso advise caution here?
“Intel’s stock has risen of late due to optimism that new leadership from their very capable new CEO will allow them to turn around their manufacturing issues and return to their former dominance. Our Underperform rating reflects not just the risk that Intel won’t reach that goal, but also the pain they will likely endure in pursuit of that goal in terms of capex, lost market share, and a shifting landscape in datacenter that will make the industry less dependent on Intel,"" Caso explained.
The analyst added, ""In addition, we’re concerned that demand in the PC market, on which Intel remains highly dependent, has been significantly pulled forward due to the pandemic, and expect an eventual mean reversion – which may unfortunately occur just as Intel needs to ramp investment.”
Caso, as noted, rates INTC an Underperform (i.e. Sell), and does not put a price target on it.
All in all, the market’s current view on INTC is a mixed bag, indicating uncertainty as to its prospects. The stock has a Hold analyst consensus rating based on 12 Buys, 10 Holds, and 8 Sells. Meanwhile, the $67.68 price target suggests a modest upside potential of nearly 6%. (See INTC stock analysis on TipRanks)

After a stellar 2020 and a promising start to 2021, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) shareholders have had a rough few months. From Jan. 26 (right before the company reported record revenue) to early March, AAPL stock dropped 19%. It’s been rallying for the past three weeks, but on April 20, we may see the catalyst that kicks it back into growth mode. Apple has announced its “Spring Loaded” event.

Here’s what to expect from this year’s first Apple event when it kicks off at 1 p.m. EST on Tuesday, April 20.
5 Products to Boost AAPL Stock: Refreshed iPads
Apple has been much more focused on its iPad lineup over the past several years, and that attention has paid off. After years of sliding sales, Apple began to invest in the iPad lineup. That paid off with an 11.5% year-over-year increase in iPad revenue in fiscal year 2020.
On Tuesday, Apple is widely expected to show off new iPad Pro models equipped with Mini-LED displays, new fast A14 processors, optional 5G and possibly a Thunderbolt port. The upgrades would make the iPad Pro incredibly powerful, with a more vivid display and faster wired connectivity to peripherals. Leaked images of a third-generation Apple Pencil stylus to accompany the new iPads have also been making the rounds.  
AirPods 3
No other product has moved the AAPL stock needle the way iPhones have. But those won’t be announced until September (the last iPhone launch was just held in October 2020).

7 Growth Stocks That Also Pay Monthly Dividends
However, another release has had an oversized impact on Apple revenue in recent years: AirPods. The wireless earbuds came out of nowhere to dominate the wireless headphone industry. In 2019, it was estimated that if AirPods were a standalone company, it would rank at number 384 on the Fortune 500. Apple has only grown that business since then.
One of the most hotly anticipated products at the Spring Loaded Event are third-generation AirPods. 
Air Tags
Apple has a habit of studying other app and accessory makers, then releasing its own versions of popular offerings. Signs are pointing to that fate befalling Tile, the maker of popular Bluetooth tracking tags for mobile devices.
Signs (including leaked prototype accessories) have been pointing to Apple releasing its own version, dubbed “Air Tags.” The Apple version would take advantage of proprietary technology, including the U1 ultra wide-band chip for precision location down to the inch and the end-to-end encryption used by Apple’s “Find My” location tracking feature.
All-New iMacs
Apple’s iMac all-in-one desktop PC has been largely unchanged for years. However, it could be the next Apple computer to get the M1 processor upgrade — plus an all-new design.
Apple ditched Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) processors in new MacBook Air and MacBook Pro models last fall. Instead, the company used its own M1 chips, which were significantly more powerful and battery-efficient. Those new MacBooks — along with the pandemic — helped Apple to achieve nearly 50% year-over-year Mac sales in Q4 2020. In its latest quarter, Apple reported Mac division revenue of $9.03 billion, up 29%.
The rumor mill is convinced that the company will unveil all-new iMacs at Tuesday’s Apple event. Apple could also be turning to a proven strategy of using color to goose up sales, in addition to making the switch to the powerful M1 processor. We could see new iMacs that look like large iPad Pros mounted on stands, with aluminum shells offered in a variety of colors. Display size could be increasing with the reduction of bezels, with 24-inch and 30-inch or 32-inch versions being suggested (compared to the current offering of 21.5 inches and 27 inches).
Supporting that theory, the iMac has been seeing inventory run low at Apple Stores — suggesting the company is clearing stock out to make way for new versions. In addition, the iMac Pro was discontinued altogether in March.
The transition to the M1 processor and the boost it offers to Mac computers is bad news for Intel, but it could prove to be a real catalyst for AAPL stock growth in 2021. 
Long Shot: A New Apple TV?
The Apple TV 4K set-top streamer is getting long in the tooth and remains expensive compared to the competition. The cheapest model goes for $179, compared to under $50 for 4K streamers from competitors like Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU). Apple has also discontinued its HomePod smart speaker, leaving the company with only the HomePod Mini.
Speculation has been growing that Apple is planning a new Apple TV, but one that’s incorporated in a soundbar. This move would allow the company to release a premium product, while justifying the price with its multiple functions. Doing so would put a larger HomePod speaker back in the lineup. An improved streaming experience would also help to move more Apple TV+ subscriptions. One hint popped up in a recent tvOS beta, which seemed to reference a new Apple TV remote. 
A new Apple TV is a long shot for Tuesday, but it’s definitely a possibility. You can also expect to see mention of spring-themed accessories, like new colors for Apple Watch bands or iPhone cases.
Apple will be streaming the Spring Loaded event starting at 1 p.m. on April 20. Keep an eye out to see all of Apple’s new gear showed off onstage. And keep an eye on AAPL stock as the market reacts to what the company announces.

But it's certainly not the only place. In fact, some of today's most essential technologies and platforms came not from Silicon Valley, but overseas -- especially East Asia.
Tech-led growth is happening at a fast pace in the region, from China to Taiwan, South Korea, and other Southeast Asian countries. So for those looking to turbocharge your portfolio returns for the 2020s, adding exposure to these three top Asian tech stocks could be a very smart move.

Naspers/Prosus
South African media company Naspers (OTC: NPSNY) made perhaps the single greatest venture investment of all-time back in 2001, when it purchased a large 33% stake in Chinese tech start-up Tencent (OTC: TCEHY) for just $32 million. Fast-forward 20 years, and that stake, if held in its entirety, would be worth $258 billion, plus dividends. Naspers did sell off about $10 billion in 2018, and it just sold another $14.6 billion at the beginning of this month. Still, even after those sales, Naspers' international holding company, Prosus (OTC: PROSY), still owns 28.9% of the Chinese giant.
However, that success posed a problem, as Naspers' size became so overwhelming on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange that it began to trade well below the value of its skyrocketing Tencent stake beginning a few years ago. In 2019, Naspers spun off Tencent and all of its other international holdings into Prosus, which listed on the Euronext exchange, with Naspers retaining roughly a 73% stake in Prosus.
Unfortunately, that didn't close the discount, as Prosus continues to trade well below the value of the Tencent stake, and Naspers trades at a discount to the value of its Prosus stake.
However, Naspers/Prosus is trying valiantly and intelligently to change that. Prosus just sold $14.6 billion of Tencent stock after Tencent's run-up during the pandemic. Although Prosus is still bullish on Tencent and has pledged not to sell any more shares for another three years, the sale could help close the discount.
Prosus may increase its $5 billion share repurchase program announced last fall, which would instantly add value, or it can also use that money to grow its non-Tencent businesses across online classifieds, food delivery, social media, and e-commerce. Analysts estimate that collection of businesses was worth another $30 billion as of last September, and probably even more now. It's likely that Prosus will do a bit of both -- growing its other businesses while repurchasing shares at a big discount -- over the next thee years.
Investors have reacted positively to the news, but Naspers and Prosus still trade at large discounts to the fair value of their publicly traded assets. Management has every incentive to close that discount, and if history is any guide, Prosus' management should allocate those new billions wisely. In any case, an investment in either Naspers or Prosus is a chance to invest in Tencent at a big discount, while also sidestepping a direct investment in China, which has become riskier because of a deterioration in U.S.-China relations.

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing
The world's most important company today may just be Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM). As the world's largest and most advanced semiconductor foundry, many of the world's greatest tech companies depend on TSM's manufacturing expertise to actually produce their leading-edge chips. Semiconductors are becoming more and more complex and their production more difficult, and Taiwan Semi has technologically moved ahead of rivals over the past few years, leading to massive growth.
Yet Taiwan Semi's stock has retreated recently, down about 17% from recent all-time highs. Why is that? A couple of reasons. First, Taiwan Semi had gone up a lot over the past year -- about 144%, while its P/E multiple has increased from about 20 to 35, even as earnings have grown.
Second, lots of attention has gone to its competitors in recent months, including Samsung and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), each of which has announced ambitious foundry investment plans in a bid to catch up to TSMC. Samsung recently announced a $116 billion spending plan to reach 3-nanometer chip production by 2022, matching Taiwan Semi by that time, and adopting gate-all-around technology before Taiwan Semi does as well.
Meanwhile, Intel, which ceded the leading-edge lead to Taiwan Semi a few years ago, also announced its intentions not only to catch up in leading-edge chip production but also to become a foundry for other chip designers as well. In conjunction, new CEO Pat Gelsinger announced that Intel would be investing $20 billion in two new fabs in Arizona.
Still, I think it's premature to say either Samsung or Intel will be able to catch up anytime soon. After all, there is a reason Taiwan Semi took the chip technology lead in the first place, and it's not unthinkable that Taiwan Semi will retain its lead past this year. It's also not a sure thing that Samsung and Intel will be successful in their high-stakes bets.
With the global pandemic accelerating digital trends, we are now in a semiconductor shortage that should last well into 2022. That rising tide should lift all boats, even if Taiwan Semi needs to share more of the pie with its rivals. While TSMC has forecast 10%-15% annualized growth over the next five years, management on the recent conference call with analysts just raised its 2021 guidance to 20% growth, and it has a track record of underpromising and overdelivering.
In short, the recent dip may be a good time to add to this long-term dividend growth stock.

Sea Limited
A potential giant in the making, Sea Limited (NYSE: SE) has very quickly leapt over its competitors to become the leading e-commerce platform in Southeast Asia.
Of course, Sea didn't start that way. Initially, it was a communication platform for video gamers, before distributing games made by Tencent for the Southeast Asian audience. The company then went on to produce its own in-house game, Free Fire, which became an international phenomenon on the company's first try out of the gate.
But Sea's ambition went well beyond video games, and the company then launched Shopee, its e-commerce platform, in 2015, along with SeaMoney, its digital financial-services arm around the same time. Shopee has been wildly successful, overtaking early e-commerce players in the region just as Southeast Asians began to adopt e-commerce in a bigger and bigger way. The pandemic then hit just as Shopee was overtaking its rivals, leading to stratospheric growth last year.
While Sea's stock has pulled back over 10% from its all-time highs recently, it is up massively over the past year, having appreciated 385% in 2020. Still, the company has proved itself with absolutely massive growth. Last quarter, revenue surged 102%, fueled by 178% e-commerce growth and 72% growth in its digital entertainment division, which includes Free Fire. Digital payments revenue rose eightfold, albeit off a very small base.
And the company isn't taking its foot off the gas, either. In 2021, Sea has already taken steps that signal even bigger growth ambitions. First, it continued to invest in its fintech ambitions by buying Jakarta-based bank Bank BKE. Acquiring a bank signals Sea's ambition to become an all-encompassing super app with lots of financial services beyond mere e-commerce payments.
Second, Sea has also entered Latin America in a bigger way. After starting with a small e-commerce team in Brazil in 2019, Shopee just launched its app in Mexico in February. The launch signaled that Sea still has bigger ambitions in Latin America, where e-commerce is underpenetrated, and where it can cross-market effectively with the many Free Fire players in the region. Moreover, Latin America has an even bigger population than Southeast Asia, with 2019 GDP of $5.2 trillion, versus Southeast Asia's $3.6 trillion.
Basically, Sea continues to grow both its product portfolio and its geographic reach, while also executing flawlessly on its core gaming and e-commerce platforms at home. A potential successful Latin American expansion could definitely push Sea's stock higher, despite the impressive run over the past year.

Network providers are in a never-ending process of improving performance and expanding coverage, and consumers have only just begun purchasing devices that can connect to 5G. Though stocks that play in the space had a great run since last summer, there's plenty of room for some of them to run higher. To that end, three Fool.com contributors think Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ: SWKS), American Tower (NYSE: AMT), and Western Digital (NASDAQ: WDC) are a buy right now.
The 5G smartphone upgrade cycle is real
Nicholas Rossolillo (Skyworks Solutions): After a few years of slumber that started in 2018 (the start of the last chip and tech hardware downturn, hastened by the U.S.-China trade war and culminating in the economic lockdown last spring), Skyworks Solutions has been on a tear. Shares of the connectivity chipmaker are up nearly 60% since the start of 2020. However, even after the big jump higher, the stock trades for 36 times trailing-12-month free cash flow.
Sure, it's not the cheapest name in the semiconductor industry. But I like where Skyworks is at right now. It's poised to benefit from a massive 5G smartphone upgrade cycle. Its largest customer, Apple, makes up about half of sales, so it has a lot to gain as iPhone fans purchase a new device with a 5G connectivity chip. It's won some other design contests for other tier one smartphone makers that could send sales soaring higher for the rest of this year, and its non-smartphone portfolio (about one-quarter of revenue) is also growing by double-digit percentages as businesses and consumers start to upgrade to Wi-Fi 6 hardware.
As to specific growth figures, Skyworks' first-quarter 2021 revenue grew 69% year over year to $1.51 billion and management forecast second-quarter sales to jump 50% from a year ago to about $1.15 billion. I'd expect the trajectory to moderate as the year progresses, but I nonetheless think demand will remain high for some time. A global chip shortage is putting a top on how many devices manufacturers can crank out right now (which should extend this sales up cycle for a while). Additionally, tech researcher Gartner estimates smartphone shipments will increase 11% in 2021, but only about one-third of phone shipments will be equipped with 5G hardware. It's a big jump from very few 5G phones sold at all in 2020, but hundreds of millions of consumers around the globe will still end 2021 without 5G.
Put another way, this next smartphone upgrade supercycle is only just beginning this year. Skyworks Solutions is in prime position to sell lots of next-gen connectivity equipment for the foreseeable future. Shares aren't totally unreasonable given the rosy outlook, so now's the time to give this semiconductor leader another look.

The best of many worlds
Anders Bylund (American Tower): Mobile devices, their components, and the network operators that serve them are crucial pieces of the 5G networking puzzle, but none of them matter without a nationwide network of cell towers. That's where American Tower comes in.
The company operates 186,000 towers and small cell sites around the world. Despite the all-American name, American Tower is a global giant. Only 43,000 of the operating sites are found within the U.S., with large tower networks in high-growth markets such as Mexico, Brazil, and Nigeria. American Tower's largest market is actually India and its 76,000 cell sites.
American Tower owns and maintains the physical infrastructure around each communications base station, leaving the networking technology to its tenants. Adding more clients to an existing tower is an effective way to increase the revenue generated by that site at a forgettable cost of capital upgrades. Allowing each customer to move in more equipment is another method. 5G networks are particularly well suited to support edge computing, which gives AMT another opportunity to boost its revenue per installation.
I'm talking about a highly profitable company with a generous dividend policy. American Tower's adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) increased by an annual average of 14% in the last decade. Dividend payouts have doubled in four years, offering an effective yield of 2% today. Meanwhile, the stock has gained just 8% since the start of 2020. The S&P 500 rose 29% in the same period.
That's how American Tower offers a unique combination of 5G-based growth, bountiful dividends, and reasonable share prices. It really is the best of several worlds.
All of that 5G data needs to be stored somewhere
Billy Duberstein (Western Digital): The advent of 5G will bring with it a massive amount of data flying back and forth among customers, businesses, and the data centers in between, both in the cloud and at the edge.
IDC anticipates data creation will grow at a 23% annual growth rate between 2020 and 2025. Even more stunning, that means the world will create over two times the amount of data during those years as the entire amount stored since data storage was created! Massive data storage needs could spell good things for Western Digital, which produces the two dominant types of data storage today: hard disk drives and NAND flash.
The data storage industry is coming off of a rough two years since the beginning of the U.S.-China trade war. Western Digital's profits have plummeted, and the company suspended its dividend after new CEO David Goeckeler took over last year, opting to use all excess free cash flow to pay down debt.
Yet there is reason for optimism. First, Western Digital's profitable HDD business, while thought to be in decline due to the rise of the faster and more dynamic NAND flash, should have longevity thanks to the massive storage needs of cloud data centers.
But perhaps more important, NAND flash prices, which have plummeted over the past two years amid oversupply, are supposed to grow about 3% to 8% this quarter, according to Trendforce. That may not seem like much, but it's actually rare, since NAND flash prices tend to decline over the long term. Flash producers attempt to keep pace with cost reductions from more advanced manufacturing techniques. For its part, Western Digital targets 15% per-bit annual cost declines.
While NAND flash is definitely a growth industry, it has more competitors than the more consolidated (and more profitable) DRAM memory and HDD industries, each of which only has three large players.
However, that could be changing. Last year, Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) agreed to sell its NAND Flash unit to SK Hynix. More recently, the Wall Street Journal reported Western Digital and another rival were considering buying Japan's Kioxia, the private equity-owned NAND flash producer that used to belong to Toshiba. Western Digital may have a leg up, as it's already a joint venture partner with Kioxia, and the two companies share manufacturing facilities.
If Toshiba is bought, either by Western Digital or someone else, the major NAND producers will have gone from six to four -- a significant consolidation that could lead to structurally better profit margins. Of course, there are also rising Chinese NAND players to watch out for, so consolidation may be necessary.
If a deal for Kioxia happens, significant industry consolidation right at the beginning of a potential NAND price up cycle could be a recipe for success for all industry players -- especially Western Digital, the stock that's perhaps most closely tied to NAND flash prices.

2021-04-18 00:00:00+00:00,"Weekly Preview: Earnings To Watch (IBM, INTC, NFLX, UAL)",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/weekly-preview%3A-earnings-to-watch-ibm-intc-nflx-ual-2021-04-18,,,"T
hanks to strong earnings results from several blue-chip companies, the stock market continues to power higher into record territory. Sustained solid economic data has served as a catalyst to drive investors into risk assets, particularly in this low-rate environment. But how much higher can stocks go, particularly with valuations seemingly stretched in several sectors? That answer is starting to become a bit more clear.
On Friday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 164.58 points, or 0.5%, to close at 34,200.67. Strong performances in Home Depot (HD), Cisco (CSCO) and Verizon (VZ) offset weaknesses in tech giant Apple (AAPL), Salesforce (CRM) and Intel (INTC). The S&P 500 index rose 15.05 points, or 0.36%, to end the session at a new closing high of 4,185.47, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.10%, adding 13.58 points to finish at 14,052.34. As with a week ago, the Nasdaq logged gains despite weakness in the stay-at-home stocks that have powered the rally since March 2020.
Not only did all three main averages finished the week higher by more than 1%, both the Dow and S&P 500 notched their fourth consecutive week of gains. Not to be outdone, the Nasdaq has produced a return in three consecutive weeks. This is notable given persistent concerns that rising bond yields has had on tech stocks, not to mention persistent fears of a weakened global economic recovery. These gains underscores the appetite the market has developed not only for sustained growth, but it also reflects the level of optimism that exist within the upcoming earnings season. And there is plenty of data to support this expectation.
Thursday’s Retail sales data, which showed a 9.8% jump in March, is one example. Economist who were expecting a 6.1% gain, attribute the strong increase to the additional stimulus consumers have received which is being spent. Elsewhere, fewer people are also filing for unemployment insurance. For the week ended April 10, the Labor Department reported 576,000 first-time filings, marking the the lowest level since March 2020.
Essentially, there is a combination of fewer job seekers with increased consumer spending. That is tough to make an argument against positive economic recovery. Evidenced by the 11% year-to-date rise in the S&P 500 index, the market is applauding that data. It is also noteworthy that cyclical sectors, particularly energy and financials which have been hit hardest by the pandemic, have seen the biggest stock increases this year. Investors are betting that vaccine distribution and the reopening of the economy will further drive stock performances.
Will this assumption pan out? With stocks trading near all-time highs, there won’t be any mercy for any company that issues disappointing guidance.
And on the subject of earnings, here are this week’s stocks I’ll be watching.
IBM (IBM) - Reports after the close, Monday, Apr. 19
Wall Street expects IBM to earn $1.63 per share on revenue of $17.36 billion. This compares to the year-ago quarter when earning were $1.84 per share on $17.57 billion in revenue.
What to watch: When will the real turnaround of IBM begin? Lackluster revenue expansion and weak EPS growth have plagued the company over the five to ten years. But the turnaround could be underway. The stock has rallied from about $115 back in January to close to $140. Now sitting near $132, the stock is facing some key resistance. The market is now, understandably, taking a wait-and-see attitude with Monday’s earnings results. The company’s cloud ambitions have promised to return value to shareholders, but IBM still hasn’t shown enough revenue strength to support a higher multiple, despite the Red Hat acquisition which was believed would modernize the cloud business. What’s more, IBM has not benefited in the massive economic expansion that saw cloud leaders such as Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT) produce double-digit revenue gains. Does IBM still have room to catch up? The market will want to hear progress on these efforts on Monday.
United Airlines (UAL) - Reports after the close, Monday, Apr. 19
Wall Street expects United Airlines to lose $6.98 per share on revenue of $3.27 billion. This compares to the year-ago quarter when the loss was $2.57 per share on revenue of $7.98 billion.
What to watch: Due to slumping booking demand caused by the pandemic, airline stocks have been one of the worst-performing sectors over the past year. But that was before vaccine distribution kicked into high gear. Not only did airline traffic end 2020 on a positive note, progress of (and distribution) vaccines have turned around investor sentiment that things can get back to “normal” much sooner than expected in 2021. But does that mean it’s time to bet on airline stocks? That’s where it’s important to pick your spots. In the case of United Airlines, the company recently pre-announced some of its first quarter results, not only did it also reveal plans to raise $5.5 billion by issuing short-term bonds, it also plans to open $5.75 billion in term loan and revolving credit facilities. In other words, given its mounting debt, there are still economics of the business that investors need to reconcile. While the company is arguably better-positioned to survive the pandemic, it will need to show significant improvements in its cash burn rate to inspire confidence.
Netflix (NFLX) - Reports after the close, Tuesday, Apr. 20
Wall Street expects Netflix to earn $2.97 per share on revenue of $7.13 billion. This compares to the year-ago quarter when earnings were $1.57 per share on $5.77 billion in revenue.
What to watch: Despite the emergence of rival streamers such as Disney+ (DIS), HBO Max (T) and Apple TV+ (AAPL), Netflix has figured out ways to maintain its status as the king of streaming. The company has been willing to consistently re-evaluate its market position and approach to remain competitive. One recent example is negotiated a deal with Sony (SNE) that now allows Netflix not only to receive more content sooner than their previously deal, it also also opens the door for both companies to delve into new partnerships. Netflix has also shown it is willing to depart from its current model of making content available “all-at-once” to the more TV-like schedule of “weekly” deliveries of popular shows. These innovative moves have allowed the company to enjoy strong subscriber increases in international markets. But how long get Netflix defend its turf? As is often the case, how the company guides for the next quarter and full year will answer this important question.
Intel (INTC) - Reports after the close, Thursday, Apr. 22
Wall Street expects Intel to earn $1.14 per share on revenue of $17.88 billion. This compares to the year-ago quarter when earnings were $1.45 per share on revenue of $19.83 billion.
What to watch: Intel shares have rebound impressively, rising some 20% in six months and is now up more than 30% year to date, besting the 11% rise in the S&P 500 index. This performance suggests that the market is willing to look past the company’s many self-inflicted wounds which has caused Intel to lose ground and market share to rivals AMD (AMD) and Nvidia (NVDA) in several important chip developments. New CEO Pat Gelsinger, meanwhile, has done a solid job in his attempt to change the negative narrative surrounding the company. But not all of Wall Street is sold. Last week Raymond James downgraded Intel from Market Perform to Underperform, citing Intel’s over-dependency on PC demand. The firm is also skeptical on Intel's foundry ambitions, saying that even with the U.S. government's support, the project will burn a lot of cash. The company on Thursday must prove the naysayers wrong, while selling the upside potential of the many growth initiatives that have been outlined.

This strategy not only helps investors avoid sweating over their portfolios, but it also helps them take advantage of the power of compounding, which can lead to big gains in the long run.
Selecting the right companies with strong businesses and prospects is critical to the success of this investment strategy, which is why we'll take a closer look at Applied Materials (NASDAQ: AMAT) and Chewy (NYSE: CHWY). Let's see why these companies could be solid picks for investors looking to score big gains over the long run.
Image source: Getty Images.
1. Applied Materials
There's a shortage of semiconductors around the world, and Applied Materials is one of the companies that can help bring more supply into the market. Applied Materials supplies semiconductor manufacturing equipment to foundries, which then use it to fabricate chips and circuits.
Not surprisingly, Applied Materials has witnessed a sharp acceleration in demand for its equipment over the past year, reflected in its terrific results quarter after quarter. The company delivered record revenue and non-GAAP earnings for the first quarter of fiscal 2021. Revenue shot up 24% year over year to $5.16 billion, while adjusted earnings jumped 42% to $1.39 per share.
Applied Materials is on track to sustain such impressive growth for a long time to come as the company is witnessing a continued spike in demand for chips across different verticals. For 2021, Applied Materials sees higher capital spending in the memory market and increased investment in foundry capacity. A closer look at end-market developments also suggests the same.
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, one of Applied Materials' key customers, is planning to spend $100 billion to improve its chip-manufacturing capacity over the next three years. Taiwan Semiconductor's massive outlay will not only go toward alleviating the global chip-supply crunch but also prepare the company to make chips that'll go toward powering new technologies.
Meanwhile, Intel and Samsung are also going to spend big on foundry capacity improvements. Chipzilla will be spending $20 billion at two Arizona factories, while Samsung plans to spend $100 billion over the next decade to boost its semiconductor manufacturing business. Thanks to such investments, global semiconductor equipment sales are expected to exceed $200 billion a year in the early 2030s, per a third-party estimate, which would be a sizable increase over last-year's $69 billion of spending.
All of this supports the potential for Applied Materials to consistently grow its revenue and earnings long term. As such, the stock looks like an ideal candidate for those with an extended investment horizon, and now would be a great time to buy as shares trade at just 22 times forward earnings.
2. Chewy
The U.S. online pet products and supplies industry is in its early phases of growth, and Chewy is turning into one of the best bets to take advantage of this fast-growing market. The online pet products retailer finished fiscal 2020 with revenue up 47% to $7.15 billion as pet parents switched to online shopping amid the pandemic.
The good news is Chewy has kept up its high pace of growth even after the early phases of reopening. Revenue increased 51% year over year in the fiscal fourth quarter that ended on Jan. 31, 2021 -- this was the first time quarterly sales exceeded the $2 billion mark. The company took just two years to reach this milestone after taking over seven years to report its first $1 billion quarter.
This is proof of the huge uptick in the number of pet owners shopping online, and Chewy saw a 43% increase in its active customer base last year to 19.2 million. Additionally, its customers are spending more money as the net sales per active customer increased 3.3% year over year at the end of fiscal 2020 to $372. The company should witness a continuous expansion in both of these metrics over the long run.
As stated by CEO Sumit Singh on the latest earnings call:
Online penetration rates in the retail food and supplies category are estimated to have grown from 7% in 2015 to 30% in 2020 and are expected to reach 53% by 2025, which is in line with the current online penetration rate of categories like books and electronics. Further, as we are observing, healthcare and services have already begun to shift online, and we believe this trend will continue and accelerate.
More importantly, Chewy notes the shift toward online purchases in the pet products industry in the wake of the pandemic is ""durable and largely permanent."" The American Pet Products Association (APPA) estimates the pet industry in the U.S. will see nearly $110 billion in revenue this year, up from $104 billion last year. This indicates that Chewy is scratching the surface of a very large opportunity that will keep growing over the years.
Finally, the company has established a leadership position in the U.S. online pet products market. According to industry data provider Packaged Facts, online pet product sales were on track to jump $3.9 billion last year.
Chewy increased its total revenue by $2.3 billion in fiscal 2020, meaning it was able to claim approximately 60% of the additional sales. The company also increased its initial wallet share of new customers in 2020 by 12% over 2019 levels.
An increasingly dominant role in the online pet products retail space and the expansion of the market overall should fuel this growth stock's upside long term, making it an ideal choice for investors looking to employ a buy-and-hold strategy.

Although no one can perfectly predict the market, the signs are there. The rising 10-year yield curve has made investors jittery about the possibility of capital moving away from stocks to bonds, and of the Federal Reserve having to increase interest rates. For a long time, high-growth companies have depended on cheap capital to fund their expansions. Facing the possibility of almost zero-interest capital vanishing, many investors are shifting their focus to value stocks.
However, high-growth stocks such as Shopify (NYSE: SHOP), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD), and Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ: ISRG) have robust balance sheets and solid structural trends. I wouldn't run away from these picks so soon.

1. Shopify
In 2020, Shopify accounted for 8.6% of the market share of U.S. retail e-commerce sales. Although far behind Amazon's leading market share of 39%, Shopify is still ahead of bigger players such as Walmart and eBay.
Shopify is not directly competing with any of these e-commerce players. Amazon and Walmart are focused on customers and on driving sales of their own products or third-party listings on their online marketplaces. Shopify's core focus is on providing merchants with tools to take their businesses online. The company also offers solutions to manage other aspects of retail business such as payments, capital, inventory and fulfillment, shipping, order management, marketing, and data analytics in a centralized fashion across all channels. Shopify's revenue stems from two sources: monthly tiered subscription payments from merchants and merchant payments for other customized solutions.
Pandemic-related e-commerce adoption and digitization of business have been the two most important growth drivers for Shopify in 2020. Although some amount of online spending could shift to brick-and-mortar channels after the pandemic, these trends will continue to transform the world for many years to come. Global retail e-commerce sales are estimated to grow almost 49% from $4.3 trillion in 2020 to $6.4 trillion in 2024.
Shopify had more than 1.7 million merchants on its platform at the end of 2020, a steep jump from its 1-million-strong merchant base at end of 2019. The rapidly expanding merchant base is attracting more developers and partners to Shopify's ecosystem, which in turn makes its platform sturdier, and thereby attracts even more merchants. This network effect has played a significant role in pushing up the company's revenue by 86% year over year to $2.9 billion and gross merchandise volume (GMV) by 96% year over year to $119.6 billion. The company also reported net income of $319.5 million in 2020, its first full year of profitability.
Shopify is trading at over 50 times sales, which is quite expensive. But because the company is helping so many businesses make a direct brand connection with their customers, I think it is still an attractive buy even at its current level. Shopify's retail strategy will assume a bigger role in future years, since Gen Z and millennials are increasingly opting for more personalized purchases. This is a multi-year opportunity, and can return rich returns to patient investors in the next decade.
2. Advanced Micro Devices
A darling of the stock market in 2020, AMD has mostly floundered in 2021. The culprits for the company's lackluster share price performance are losing some of its central processing unit (CPU) market share to Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) in the fourth quarter of 2020 and not being able to do much about it due to severe semiconductor shortages. While Intel designs and manufactures its chips, it is Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) that does most of the chip production work for AMD. With tight foundry capacity, AMD was unable to meet all demand in the fourth quarter.
However, these problems may be close to resolution. According to a Steam Hardware & Software survey, AMD's CPU market share for Microsoft's Windows operating systems increased from 25% to 28.97% from December 2020 to March 2021. At the same time, Intel's market share dropped from 75% to 71.02%. Although the survey only pertains to Steam gaming platform users, it highlights a trend in the overall CPU market, considering that Steam had 120 million active users globally in 2020.
AMD can also expect these production worries to ease, now that Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing has announced plans to invest $100 billion in capacity expansion over the next three years. With AMD being a prominent TSM client, these investments are bound to help the company.
Despite the many concerns, AMD's fiscal 2020 performance is quite encouraging, thanks to the company's focus on high-end CPUs and graphical processing units (GPUs), which are used extensively in the rapidly expanding gaming and data center markets. The company's revenue jumped 45% year over year, while net income more than doubled in 2020. Yet AMD is trading just over 10 times trailing-12-month sales, which is the lowest valuation for the company in the past 10 years. With a significant technological advantage over peers and gradually improving foundry capacity, AMD could prove to be an attractive investment for patient investors.
3. Intuitive Surgical
Leading robotic surgery player Intuitive Surgical's stock has gained just under 60% in the last year. This is especially commendable considering the pandemic caused hospitals to delay elective procedures, thereby reducing demand for the company's robotic da Vinci surgery system.
The company's fourth-quarter (ended Dec. 31, 2020) revenue grew by only 4% year over year, a significant decline from 22% year-over-year growth in the prior-year quarter. However, even the modest fourth-quarter top-line growth in such trying times is a testament to the success of the company's solid razor-and-blades business model.
Currently, there are 5,989 da Vinci systems installed across the world. So, although revenue from the sale of systems declined year over year by 12% to $1.2 billion, recurring revenue earned from the sale of instruments and accessories as well as service contracts increased by 6% year over year to $3.4 billion in 2020. Recurring revenue accounted for 77% of the company's total sales in 2020, which implies significant top-line visibility and low revenue volatility in coming years.
Intuitive Surgical is focused on expanding the type of procedures that can be performed with da Vinci as well as on expanding in international markets such as China, Taiwan, and India. The company also boasts the highest number of robotic surgery systems installed compared to the competition. Once surgeons and healthcare professionals are trained on one system, there are significant costs in terms of the learning curve and comfort level involved in switching to other systems. Each da Vinci system costs between $1 million and $2 million. Hence, it is not easy for hospitals to forgo such huge capital investments and switch to competing systems.
Trading over 21 times trailing-12-month sales, Intuitive Surgical is not cheap. However, considering that the company dominates the robot-assisted surgical systems market, expected to be worth $17.8 billion by 2027, there is much room for this healthcare stock to grow in coming years.

NEW YORK, April 16 (Reuters) - U.S. technology and growth stocks have taken the market's reins in recent weeks, pausing a rotation into value shares as investors assess the trajectory of bond yields and upcoming earnings reports.
Technology .SPLRCT has been the top-performing S&P 500 .SPX sector in April, rising 8% versus a 5% rise for the benchmark index. Big tech-related growth stocks in other S&P 500 sectors such as Amazon Inc AMZN.O, Tesla Inc TSLA.O and Google-parent Alphabet Inc GOOGL.O have also charged higher.
The gains have followed a months-long rotation in which tech stocks were outpaced by shares of banks, energy companies and other economically-sensitive names that have surged since breakthroughs in COVID-19 vaccines late last year.
The increases in many of these so-called value stocks have slowed lately, while U.S. Treasury prices have come galloping back in April after a sharp first-quarter sell-off. This suggests that some investors may have already priced in a rapid growth spurt that is showing up in economic data.
""Tech and growth has started to pick up a little bit because people are getting a little more cautious,"" said Lindsey Bell, chief investment strategist at Ally Invest. ""Investors are in this wait-and-see mode ... at least until earnings get underway.""
One of the key drivers of the move in tech has been the Treasury market, with the benchmark 10-year note yield falling about 15 basis points in April to about 1.6% on Friday.
Higher bond yields are particularly challenging for the performance of tech and other shares with high valuations and high expected future profits, as rising yields reduce the stocks' values in many standard models. The 10-year yield US10YT=RR rose about 83 basis points in the first quarter.
""People are probably taking a little bit of a deep breath and saying, 'OK, maybe rates aren't going to go straight to (2.50%),'"" said Chris Galipeau, senior market strategist at Putnam Investments.
Shares of tech and other companies with strong ""stay-at-home"" businesses could also strengthen if there are snags in the countrywide vaccination drive or other problems with the recovery, investors said.
For example, a call by U.S. health agencies this week to pause use of Johnson & Johnson's JNJ.N coronavirus vaccine spurred a move into some stay-at-home stocks and out of travel names tied to the economic reopening.
Investors also pointed to the impending influx of quarterly reports as key to determining market leadership, with Netflix Inc NFLX.O and Intel Corp INTC.O among the major tech and growth company earnings due next week.
Many investors think the recent market shift is just a pause, with value and cyclical stocks due to regain command after years of lagging, as investors seize on shares expected to benefit most from what the Federal Reserve expects will be the strongest economic growth in nearly 40 years.
""My guess is we will see more of this internal rotation where growth takes a break and then it comes on and then value takes a break and then it comes on,"" Galipeau said. ""It won't surprise me if that continues for a couple of years.""
Others have become more wary of the equity market in general. Strategists at BofA Global Research recently issued a report listing five reasons for caution on stocks, including high valuations and outsized returns over the past year. The bank kept its year-end S&P 500 target at 3,800, some 9% below current levels. The index has risen 11% this year.
""Amid increasingly euphoric sentiment, lofty valuations, and peak stimulus, we continue to believe the market has overly priced in the good news,"" BofA's strategists wrote.

Welcome to the home for real-time coverage of equity markets brought to you by Reuters reporters.
HOUSING STARTS PARTY LIKE IT'S 2006, UMICH TOUCHES 1-YEAR HIGH (1100 EDT/1500 GMT)
A data duet released on Friday showed a housing market rushing to fill the discrepancy between spiking demand and record low supply, and the best consumer attitude in a year, with some caveats.
Groundbreaking on new U.S. homes USHST=ECI jumped 19.4% in March to 1.739 million units at a seasonally adjusted annualized rate (SAAR), according to the Commerce Department.
The number came in 126,000 units more than analysts expected, representing a robust bounce-back from February's 11.3% plunge, while marking the biggest monthly surge since June 2006, the height of the housing market bubble.
Building permits USBPE=ECI, a more forward-looking indicator, increased at a more docile 2.7% to 1.766 million units SAAR in a partial rebound from the 8.8% drop the previous month.
""We expect the pace of housing starts to slow modestly over the balance of 2021, but still look for starts to be up more than 6% for the year,"" writes Nancy Vanden Houten, lead economist at Oxford Economics. ""While homebuilders face considerable pressures on the cost side, particularly from record-high lumber prices, they remain upbeat and report strong demand from prospective buyers.""
The National Association of Homebuilders (NAHB) would agree. The NAHB's homebuilder sentiment indicator, released on Thursday, remains well above pre-pandemic levels, though down from recent highs.
""There is a growing backlog of starts based on permits already issued,"" Vanden Houten adds. ""The backlog of starts in part reflects supply chain issues that are delaying the start of construction and should support the pace of starts (as) these issues are resolved.""
Next, the good folks at the University of Michigan gave a sneak preview of consumer mood this month with the release of their advance consumer sentiment index USUMSP=ECI.
It showed the consumer, who contributes about 70% to U.S. GDP, has grown slightly more optimistic in April, the index inching up to a reading of 86.5, below the anticipated 89.6.
Despite its smaller-than-expected gain, the report marked the highest UMich level in a year.
The slight consensus miss was largely attributable to the closely watched expectations component, which stayed flat at 79.7 instead of advancing to 83.6 as projected.
Current conditions, by contrast, advanced to 97.2.
""This is opposite of the usual pattern over the past fifty years, when recoveries were paced by larger and earlier gains in expectations,"" notes Richard Curtin, chief economist at UMich's Surveys of Consumers.
""The strength in current economic conditions reflects much larger than usual stimulus payments during the past year,"" Curtin said, adding ""factors that held back expectations included persistent concerns with vaccine safety as well as a surge in year-ahead inflation expectations.""
The chart below shows headline and expectations components against the saving rate, seen by many as a barometer of consumer outlook:
Investor moods were also generally optimistic as they head into the weekend with the first week of first-quarter results in the books.
While the Nasdaq .IXIC is slightly red, the three major U.S. indexes are headed for weekly gains.

THE TGIF REOPENING PLAY: STOCKS PUSHED TO RECORD HIGHS - AGAIN (0955 EDT/1355 GMT)
Wall Street opened mostly higher on Friday, as investors prepared to sail into the weekend under the power of upside surprises in earnings and economic data.
Economically sensitive cyclicals and transports .DJT are ahead of the pack. However, megacap market leaders, Tesla TSLA.O, Apple AAPL.O, and Amazon.com AMZN.O are quickly dragging the Nasdaq .IXIC into negative territory.
The S&P 500 .SPX and the Dow .DJI, which have reached several new closing highs this week, have set courses for their fourth consecutive weekly gains, and the Nasdaq is on track for its third.
Morgan Stanley MS.N wrapped up a week of big bank earnings which fired the starting pistol for first-quarter reporting season. The broker hummed a tune we've grown familiar with this week; better-than-expected quarterly profit largely due to benefits from reserve releases, record capital markets activity and a surge in trading volumes.
On the downside, they disclosed a near $1 billion loss from the Archegos fire sale. MS shares are modestly lower.
Next week, earning season puts the pedal to the metal, with Netflix NFLX.O, Johnson & Johnson JNJ.N, Procter & Gamble PG.N, American Airlines AAL.O, and Intel INTC.O among the heavy hitters due at bat.

DON'T GET SHORT WITH ME! (0900 EDT/1300 GMT)
Short sellers have been reducing their exposure to U.S. stocks recently with the value of shares sold short decreasing by 3.2%, or $35.4 billion, to $1.08 trillion, according to the latest data from S3 Partners.
While the list of five stocks with the most short exposure is unchanged, Ihor Dusaniwsky pointed to ""positional jockeying below"" with the most dramatic changes showing up in ViacomCBS VIAC.O:
ViacomCBS, whose shares have fallen more than 60% from its record high since March 15, dropped from the No. 6 position to the No. 38 position in the most shorted league table, according to S3.
Also, Walt Disney Co DIS.N fell from a 17 ranking to 26 while Baidu Inc ADR BIDU.O dropped from 22nd place to 50th and Exxon Mobil Corp XOM.N fell from No. 25 to No. 51.
Meanwhile Analog Devices Inc ADI.O moved into 10th place from 15th while AstraZeneca AZN.O climbed from 20th to 15th while S&P Global Inc SPGI.K climbed to 21st from 31st.
Stocks that are a big focus among members of online forums on Reddit, and stocks caught up in the Archegos margin call liquidation, saw the biggest decrease in short exposure.
Although S3 notes that most of the declines are the result of mark-to-market stock price moves and not short covering which means that it is not due to shorts exiting their positions.
In this category S3 includes Viacom, GSX Techedu Inc GSX.N, Discovery Inc's DISCA.O, DISCK.O class A and C shares, iQIYI IQ.O, GameStop GME.N and Futu Holdings FUTU.O.

2021-04-16 00:00:00+00:00,NVIDIA Goes After Intel's Most Lucrative Business,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/nvidia-goes-after-intels-most-lucrative-business-2021-04-16,,,"When graphics chip specialist NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) announced the $40 billion acquisition of Arm Holdings, it was a foregone conclusion that the company was going to try to extend its reach beyond GPUs. While that acquisition still needs to get past regulatory scrutiny, NVIDIA is wasting no time.
NVIDIA unveiled its first data center CPU earlier this week. The NVIDIA Grace CPU is an Arm-based processor aimed squarely at artificial intelligence and high-performance computing workloads. NVIDIA is claiming that the CPU can deliver a tenfold performance boost over existing server chips in some cases.
Image source: NVIDIA.
A wildly profitable business
Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) is the dominant leader in the server chip market. Chips based on the x86 instruction set are the industry standard, and Intel and rival Advanced Micro Devices are the only options.
Other companies have tried to make Arm-based servers a thing, and they've all failed miserably. Qualcomm, a leader in mobile chips, gave up on its quest to provide an alternative to Intel's server chips after the company failed to gain any traction. Qualcomm is now trying to sell server chips aimed at specialized tasks like AI, a much smaller market opportunity.
Intel makes a lot of money selling server chips, and that hasn't changed even as AMD steals market share. Intel generated $26 billion of revenue and $10.6 billion of operating income from its data center segment in 2020. The lack of alternatives means sky-high margins for Intel.
NVIDIA isn't going after the entire server chip market, at least not right now. In its press release announcing the Grace CPU, the company was explicit in saying that ""the vast majority of data centers are expected to be served by existing CPUs."" Grace ""will serve a niche segment of computing.""
Going after AI workloads makes a lot of sense for NVIDIA. The company already dominates the market for data center GPUs, which are used for computationally intensive workloads that CPUs aren't well suited for. NVIDIA can get its foot in the door with Grace and build out an ecosystem around its CPUs. Once Arm-based server chips have a foothold, chipping away at Intel's dominance will be an easier task.
Grace won't be available until 2023, so Intel doesn't have anything to worry about just yet. But NVIDIA has managed to secure two supercomputer deals for its new CPU, a big vote of confidence in the company's efforts. The Swiss National Computer Center will use NVIDIA's Grace CPUs and its next-generation GPUs to power Alps, a new supercomputer set to go online in 2023. Los Alamos National Laboratory also has plans for a Grace-powered supercomputer.
Growing the data center business
The days of NVIDIA being primarily a gaming-focused company are long gone. The data center business is now nearly as big as the gaming business, generating about $1.9 billion of revenue in the most recent quarter. With NVIDIA able to offer a server CPU come 2023, the company's total addressable market will expand by billions of dollars annually.
NVIDIA will still need to build an ecosystem around these chips, and customers will need to commit to an architecture that has little presence in the data center. But NVIDIA is playing the long game, and there's a good chance the company will be able to carve out a portion of the data center CPU market for itself.

2021-04-16 00:00:00+00:00,New Intel CEO Plays Chip Shortage Super-Cycle to Investors’ Advantage,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/new-intel-ceo-plays-chip-shortage-super-cycle-to-investors-advantage-2021-04-16,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Before the pandemic, semiconductor makers were talking up the idea of a “super-cycle,” a continuous rise in demand replacing the old boom-and-bust days of previous decades.

That super-cycle is now becoming a super-shortage, as companies like Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) find it difficult to meet customer demands using global supply chains.
The short-term shortage has halted Intel’s momentum, just as it was expected to go into overdrive after Pat Gelsinger was recruited from VMware (NYSE:VMW) as CEO. Shares are still up nearly 31% for the year, but they’re up just 4% since he took the helm in mid February. Over four days of trading leading into April 15, they were down about 6%.
But while the speculators run away, the low tide may be making a great case for long-term investment in Intel.
A-Biden’ With Intel
While speculation on the Biden Administration’s infrastructure plan is centered on electric cars, Intel may become the Administration’s most-favored company. The President’s 100-day review of semiconductor supply chains may be the company’s golden moment.
Under Gelsinger, Intel is putting $20 billion into two new Arizona manufacturing plants. The new boss is promising to match rival Taiwan Semiconductor’s (NYSE:TSM) UV light process, under which it promises to complete the job of Moore’s Law and bring circuit lines within 2 nanometers of each other.
Taiwan Semi is also investing $35 billion in new Arizona manufacturing. This will make the desert a center of global semiconductor production by the middle of this decade. Both Intel and TSMC will run their plants as foundries, making chips for whoever needs capacity.

Over the last decades, low-cost labor and environmental trouble pushed chip-making offshore. More than 80% of semiconductors are now made in Asia, against 12% in the U.S. The plans of TSMC and Intel will reverse the trend.
Gelsinger admits the new capacity will take a few years to develop. Meanwhile there will be shortages, and prices will be firm. This is good for Intel.
Intel has a plan for getting into autonomous car technology by 2023, using the short-term shortage to its advantage. Gelsinger is talking to companies like General Motors (NYSE:GM) and Ford Motor (NYSE:F) about Intel having short-term supply and a long-term plan. While TSMC deals with supply problems caused by a drought, Intel still has plenty of inventory that can get U.S. car production rolling again.
A False Fall
The announcement by Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) that it will make server chips that compete with Intel’s created the latest leg down in INTC stock. But the move was expected after Nvidia said it would buy ARM Holdings from Softbank (OTCMKTS:SFTBY) for $40 billion last year.
More important, it doesn’t hurt Intel nearly as badly as analysts fear. That’s because Nvidia isn’t really “making” the chips. Like most other U.S. semiconductor firms, Nvidia is “fab-less.” It’s a design house. It needs manufacturing capacity. That’s what Intel will now provide.
The Bottom Line on INTC Stock
The difference between speculating and investing is time. Speculators don’t have it. Investors do. By buying good companies, like INTC stock,  and holding them for years, you can make money.
Intel is a good example. I like to bet the jockey more than the horse. Pat Gelsinger is a good jockey. He spent most of his career at Intel, rising to chief technology officer. He was pushed out in 2009, but after former CEO Brian Krzanich denuded the company of talent, he was called back this year by finance guy turned CEO Robert Swan.
Swan’s song to Gelsinger may have been his best act at Intel. He cleared the decks for bold action by a man who knows his business. That makes the present weakness look like a long-term opportunity.

2021-04-15 00:00:00+00:00,Why AMD Stock Popped Today,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-amd-stock-popped-today-2021-04-15,,,"What happened
Shares of semiconductor stock Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) jumped 4.5% by the close of trading on Thursday after a pair of Wall Street banks endorsed the stock with buy ratings.
So what
First in line this morning was Raymond James, which according to StreetInsider.com initiated coverage of AMD with an outperform rating and a $100 price target. Citing AMD's 15% pullback in share price since the year began, Raymond James said now is the time to ""get involved with AMD,"" which has been hurt both by investor anticipation of a turnaround at archrival Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), and also by this week's announcement that NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) is moving into the business of building CPUs to compete with both AMD and Intel.
Contradicting these theories, the analyst predicts that AMD will retain an advantage in CPUs through at least 2024.
Echoing the sentiment, Bank of America today reiterated its own buy rating and $100 price target on AMD, predicting that AMD's recent underperformance is likely to correct as investors clue in to the edge AMD's Milan chips still hold over Intel's new Ice Lake server CPUs. Additionally, Bank of America reminded investors that Intel's new 7nm products won't be on the market for another couple of years, by which point AMD's lead could be insurmountable.

Now what
Ultimately, Bank of America anticipates that AMD will steal more than 3 full percentage points worth of market share over the next several years, probably mostly from Intel. So while value investors may prefer Intel's 14 P/E ratio over AMD's loftier 38 times earnings valuation, growth investors should know AMD is the semiconductor stock with momentum.

The U.S. chip giant announced the sale last October, part of a move to divest non-core businesses to focus on its smaller but more lucrative Optane memory business which uses more advanced technology.
The deal is SK Hynix's biggest acquisition, which will help it close the gap with market leader Samsung Electronics Co Ltd 005930.KS. NAND chips are used to store data in smartphones and data centre servers.
SK Hynix sought EU antitrust approval on April 13. The EU competition enforcer can clear the deal with or without concessions, or it can open a four-month long investigation if it has serious concerns.
