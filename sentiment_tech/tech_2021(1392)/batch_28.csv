2021-05-28 00:00:00+00:00,This Hot Growth Stock Is Still a Screaming Buy After 900% Gains,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/this-hot-growth-stock-is-still-a-screaming-buy-after-900-gains-2021-05-28,,,"A $1,000 investment in Applied Materials (NASDAQ: AMAT) stock made a decade ago would be worth more than $10,000 today, which seems a tad surprising as the tech company's revenue and earnings didn't grow at particularly eye-popping rates over that period.
The company, which supplies key fabrication equipment, services, and software that semiconductor manufacturers use to make their chips, had a 10-year compound annual revenue growth rate of just 6.06%. It brought in $9.55 billion in revenue in its fiscal 2010; that increased to $17.2 billion in its fiscal 2020, which ended Oct. 25. Its non-GAAP net income increased from $1.18 billion to $3.85 billion over the same period, translating to a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 12.54%.
AMAT data by YCharts
Meanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 index has registered a CAGR of 12% in revenue and 20% in earnings since 2003. And the index is up by almost 500% over the past decade, which is impressive. But Applied Materials stock has beaten it handsomely despite underperforming in terms of top- and bottom-line growth.
The good news for investors is that Applied Materials looks well-positioned to beat the broader market's revenue and earnings growth over the next decade, which could lead to even stronger stock price growth than it delivered in the last one.
Benefiting from the global chip shortage
The novel coronavirus pandemic gave Applied Materials a huge shot in the arm last year as global demand for semiconductor chips shot up to support the shift to remote work and online education. Semiconductor sales jumped 6.5% worldwide to $439 billion in 2020, over-straining a supply chain that was already impaired by the COVID-19 crisis.
Not surprisingly, chipmakers scrambled to add manufacturing capacity in a bid to meet the surging demand. Applied Materials benefited from this and finished its fiscal 2020 with an 18% increase in revenue and a 37% increase in adjusted earnings per share. Fiscal 2021 so far is turning out to be an even better year as semiconductor companies continue to spend billions of dollars to ramp up production capacity.

In its recently concluded fiscal second quarter, Applied Materials' revenue increased 41% year over year to $5.58 billion, while adjusted earnings soared 83% to $1.63 per share. Those results easily exceeded the company's guidance and were far better than the company's fiscal Q1 revenue and earnings growth rates of 24% and 42%, respectively.
Based on the company's guidance, this surge is not running out of steam. The company anticipates non-GAAP earnings of $1.76 per share this quarter on revenue of $5.92 billion, which is much higher than Wall Street's expectations of $1.56 per share in earnings on $5.53 billion revenue. The company delivered $1.06 per share in earnings on revenue of $4.4 billion in the prior year period.
In sum, Applied Materials' growth has accelerated over the past year as semiconductor demand has increased. More importantly, the massive end-market opportunity indicates that it could keep growing at similarly high rates for a long time to come.
A multiyear growth opportunity lies ahead
Semiconductor demand is expected to rise by a double-digit percentage this year. VLSI Research estimates an 11% increase in chip demand in 2021 following last year's 7% increase. That's expected to result in supply shortages persisting into the second half of the year. As a result, chipmakers are expected to keep adding more capacity.
Industry association SEMI forecasts an increase of 15.5% in spending on fabrication equipment this year, followed by a 12.2% spike in 2022. Major semiconductor foundries across the globe have already announced huge plans for infrastructure investments.
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, for instance, has announced it will invest $100 billion over the next three years to increase fabrication capacity. Intel has also outlined plans for $20 billion in investments to expand its chip manufacturing capacity in the U.S., while South Korean giant Samsung recently said that it would invest $151 billion in non-memory chip production through 2030.
The Korea Semiconductor Industry Association estimates that through 2023, that country's chipmakers will pour a combined 510 trillion won (around $457 billion) into growing their chip-making capacity. All of this is great news for Applied Materials -- the company gets 53% of its total revenue from Korea, Taiwan, and the U.S.
Such huge investments will be necessary for chipmakers to meet the world's growing need for semiconductors. The global semiconductor market was worth $439 billion last year, and one third-party estimate forecasts that by 2030, it will exceed annual sales of $1 trillion.
In all, it can be said that Applied Materials is built for long-term growth, as evidenced by the 20%-plus annualized earnings growth analysts are forecasting for it over the long run. More importantly, investors looking to add a top growth stock to their portfolio should consider buying Applied Materials straight away. It's trading at less than 19 times forward earnings, which is an attractive valuation considering its solid and rapid growth pace.

2021-05-28 00:00:00+00:00,Tesla Stock and Cryptocurrencies Are Dropping: Which Is the Better Bargain Right Now?,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/tesla-stock-and-cryptocurrencies-are-dropping%3A-which-is-the-better-bargain-right-now-2021,,,"With autonomous driving, Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) is looking to disrupt the auto industry. Meanwhile, in financial services, cryptocurrencies are trying to challenge the entire existing global financial system. Investors have supported Tesla as well as leading cryptocurrencies, which all saw significant gains last year. But right now investors seem to be reevaluating the prospects as well as risks involved in these investments.
Tesla stock is nearly 30% off its all time high that it reached in January. Similarly, cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC), Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH), and Dogecoin (CRYPTO: DOGE) are all more than 35% off their highs this year. Let's see whether Tesla stock or cryptocurrencies is the better bargain right now.
A top EV stock
With a price-to-sales ratio of 17, and a market capitalization that exceeds the combined market cap of competitors Toyota Motor, Volkswagen, Ford Motor, and General Motors, Tesla stock looks way overvalued even after its fall this year. But it doesn't look so if we consider two key factors. The first one is Tesla's growth rate. In the last five years, the company grew its sales at an average rate of more than 50%. Moreover, it expects to grow its deliveries at an average rate of more than 50% over a ""multi-year"" timeframe. That makes its price-to-sales ratio look much more reasonable.
Image source: Getty Images.
The second and more important factor is Tesla's lead in the autonomous driving segment. On the latest quarterly call, Tesla CEO Elon Musk provided an update on the progress of the company's vision-based system for autonomous driving. The company's management believes that it no longer needs to rely on radar technology for full self-driving (FSD), and the company can achieve FSD solely through its vision-only system.
Musk also highlighted that Tesla has been collecting video data through its more than a million cars currently in use. This extensive data is used to constantly ""train"" the company's self-driving system. Musk believes that Tesla's vision-only system is far better than lidar or radar technologies that others are working on. Alphabet's (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Waymo and Intel's (NASDAQ: INTC) Mobileye are among the companies researching lidar and radar technologies.
Notably, though Musk has long been particularly critical of lidar technology, reports of an agreement with Luminar Technologies apparently sent Tesla's stock soaring on Monday. A combination of two or more technologies may help achieve full autonomy faster, and investors probably liked Tesla's open approach to this end.
Are cryptocurrencies a good investment?
Compared to Tesla stock, cryptocurrencies look like a far riskier bet. With no way to figure out the true value of a cryptocurrency, it's difficult to say whether the recent fall has made them attractive enough to buy.
There are several unknowns when it comes to cryptocurrencies. How open will governments be to cryptocurrencies' growth? How can the transactions be taxed? How can it be ensured that cryptocurrencies are not used for illegal activities and money laundering? What are the potential environmental impacts of crypto mining? There are innumerable issues that must be addressed before hoping for a wider adoption of cryptocurrencies.
Image source: Getty Images.
Apart from the above mentioned issues, there are unknowns such as how a particular cryptocurrency system will perform when the number of transactions and users increases manifold. Not many other cryptocurrencies, apart from Bitcoin, have already proven to be resilient once transactions increase. As a technology in its infancy, the system faces several potential unknown challenges.
And until cryptocurrencies become a widely acceptable mode of transactions, if at all, they are likely to remain volatile.
Tesla vs. cryptocurrencies
Notably, Tesla too faces risks. It is quite likely that some other tech company, such as Waymo or Mobileye, delivers autonomous driving before Tesla can. Indeed, these companies know more about AI (artificial intelligence) and machine learning than Tesla. Other leading automakers are also working on autonomous driving through subsidiaries including Cruise and Argo, and it's likely that one of them emerges as the winner in the race for commercializing full self-driving.
Still, all the work that Tesla has done so far, and continues to do, on FSD technology may mean that it can adopt and commercialize that technology, even if it isn't the first one to bring it to the market. Its brand value and cult-like following mean that fans will buy a Tesla car as long as it's equally good, if not better, than what other automakers are offering. The company has a proven track record of offering improved cars and technology, and I think it will continue to be committed to excellence.
In short, Tesla looks like a far better bargain today than cryptocurrencies.

LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - Concise insights on global finance.
-----------------------------------------------
IMITATION GAME. Activists are trying to turn the tables on corporate agitator Dan Loeb at his London investment vehicle. Asset Value Investors, which own 10% of Loeb’s $858 million Third Point Offshore Investors, has criticised https://www.assetvalueinvestors.com/content/uploads/2021/05/AVI-Open-Letter-to-TPIL-Vote-Co_2.pdf a lacklustre plan to raise the fund’s uninspiring valuation. They have a point: shares trade at a 14% markdown to net asset value, a discount which has broadly persisted over the past five years. By contrast, AVI claims the median NAV discount for comparable London-listed closed-end funds is just 4%.
Loeb at least recognises the problem. In April Third Point put forward a plan to reduce the discount to 7.5%. But measures including adding extra leverage and increasing the proportion of assets in unlisted private equity are unconvincing. And two proposed offers to buy back shares at a mere 2% discount to NAV would only take place in 2024 and 2027. Such weak suggestions would probably attract the ire of Loeb himself given recent campaigns at Prudential and Intel. That gives AVI reason enough to keep agitating. (By Christopher Thompson)

Technological advancements are evolving quickly, making it hard to keep up. Quantum computing is one of these trends and there is an assortment of quantum computing stocks for investors to monitor for key developments.
These companies, if successful, can transform many key industries.
But what is quantum computing? Basically, the technology offers more speed and solutions for businesses and society by applying quantum physics “to create new ways of computing.”
Experts expect much faster computing able to use artificial intelligence to solve very complex problems impossible for classic computers to handle. Potential applications range from finance and the military to aerospace, healthcare, cybersecurity and blockchain.
Quantum computing will not replace the computers we use for personal or business. Specialized quantum systems are costly. There is a market, though, despite the cost. Business Insider published an article stating the “quantum computing market is projected to reach $64.98 billion by 2030.”

Intel is producing quantum processors in Oregon. The company is a tech giant that played a role in several pioneering technologies. Intel says it plans to to reach the production-level quantum computing within 10 years:
“Research at Intel Labs has led directly to the development of Tangle Lake, a superconducting quantum processor that incorporates 49 qubits in a package that is manufactured at Intel’s 300-millimeter fabrication facility in Hillsboro, Oregon. This device represents the third-generation of quantum processors produced by Intel, scaling upward from 17 qubits in its predecessor.”
Although 10 years sounds like a long time, creating the technology is both challenging and requires a lot of testing.
Intel has developed a technology known as spin qubits. It says, “Spin qubits function based on the spin of a single electron in silicon, controlled by microwave pulses.” The advantages of this technology include operating temperature, stability and duration, plus physical size.
Microsoft (MSFT)

Microsoft Quantum is considered to be the “world’s first full-stack, open cloud quantum computing ecosystem.”
The company is building a scalable quantum system with an emphasis on worldwide research teams and partnerships. And if you think that you can program a quantum computer easily, then guess again. It is not easy. That is why the company is developing a quantum stack. Says the company, “The Microsoft Quantum stack provides everything needed to program a quantum computer, including a control system, software, development tools, and Azure services.”
There is also a development kit for quantum computing and optimization. The kit is open-source and paired with open cloud ecosystem Azure Quantum.

2021-05-27 00:00:00+00:00,INTC July 9th Options Begin Trading,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intc-july-9th-options-begin-trading-2021-05-27,,,"Investors in Intel Corp (Symbol: INTC) saw new options become available today, for the July 9th expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the INTC options chain for the new July 9th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $56.50 strike price has a current bid of $1.24. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $56.50, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $55.26 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of INTC, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $57.63/share today.
Because the $56.50 strike represents an approximate 2% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 100%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 2.19% return on the cash commitment, or 18.63% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Intel Corp, and highlighting in green where the $56.50 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $58.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.63. If an investor was to purchase shares of INTC stock at the current price level of $57.63/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $58.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 3.47% if the stock gets called away at the July 9th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if INTC shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Intel Corp, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing INTC's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $58.00 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $58.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 2.83% boost of extra return to the investor, or 24.01% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.
Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 253 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $57.63) to be 38%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

2021-05-27 00:00:00+00:00,U.S. chip subsidy effort faces pushback over China issues,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/u.s.-chip-subsidy-effort-faces-pushback-over-china-issues-2021-05-27,,,"By Stephen Nellis, David Shepardson and Michael Martina
WASHINGTON, May 27 (Reuters) - A series of amendments for a $190 billion U.S. Senate bill aimed at countering China's technology challenge are in limbo after business groups protested proposals intended to ensure that none of the money finds its way to China or other U.S. rivals.
New regulations or reviews of investments or deals in China could disrupt U.S. businesses' future operations in that country, which include semiconductors and medical equipment. The bilateral trade deficit has run more than $100 billion a year since 2002.
Senators from both sides of the aisle want ""guardrails,"" such as mandatory security disclosures and interagency reviews to stop U.S. businesses from compromising national security by outsourcing critical technologies to China.
The Senate bill authorizes $120 billion for high-tech research and another $54 billion to subsidize U.S. semiconductor production. For chip factories, it makes no distinction between foreign recipients and U.S.-based firms in determining who gets funds for U.S. facilities.
A key goal of the funding is to bring the world's most advanced chip plants to the United States, and only Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co 2330.TW and Korea's Samsung Electronics Co Ltd 005930.KS have the technology to do that.
Florida Republican Senator Marco Rubio has proposed an amendment requiring U.S. national security officials to screen recipients and require disclosure of funding or support from foreign entities, including the Chinese government or Chinese state-owned enterprises.
TSMC and Samsung both have operations in China.
Another amendment from Democratic Senator Bob Casey and Republican Senator John Cornyn would require an interagency review of any U.S. investments in China or a shortlist of adversarial countries. That would mark a huge change for U.S. law, which for decades has had provisions for screening inbound investments, but not for outbound.
""If a company wants to offshore semiconductors to China, we need to know about it,"" Casey said from the Senate floor on Wednesday. ""Yet, business interests, like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the U.S.-China Business Council, are organizing against this commonsense proposal.""
Casey took to task Republicans opposing the measure, saying they talk tough on China, but they ""cut and run"" when it comes to taking on big business.
John Murphy, the U.S. Chamber's senior vice president for international policy, said existing laws, such as the Export Control Reform Act of 2018 (ECRA), could address the China investment issue, and that the proposal needed more discussion in the Senate before being added to such a sweeping package.
""Congress and the administration should focus on using the legal tools on which the paint is barely dry,"" he said, referring to ECRA.
One Senate aide cited fierce opposition to the Casey-Cornyn amendment from businesses and some Republicans, including Senator Mike Crapo, the ranking member on the Senate Finance Committee, adding: ""We're not confident that it's going to come to a vote.""
Crapo declined to comment.
FUNDAMENTAL FLAW?
Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has sought to get the U.S. Innovation and Competition Act passed this week, but Republicans insist the bill is not ready.
""There is an increasing consensus that the lack of guardrails is the fundamental flaw of the bill,"" a Republican House aide said of the Senate package.
The House of Representatives is planning its own version of a China bill and could add other provisions on chips funding as well.
Rubio's office said it was still working on getting his amendment incorporated. When he proposed his amendment for counterintelligence screening last week, he noted the much needed investments would ""mean nothing if they are stolen by foreign adversaries, including the Chinese Communist Party.""
Any restrictions on subsidies to foreign companies would likely benefit Intel Corp INTC.O, the long-time U.S. national champion in chip-making that has promised to redouble its efforts in the most advanced technologies and spend more than $20 billion on new U.S. plants.
Intel last year moved to sell off its only chip factory in China to SK Hynix 000660.KS.
Derek Scissors, of the conservative American Enterprise Institute, who studies China and security issues, said companies should be forced to make a choice.
""If you receive federal government money, you cannot expand your business in China from that point. The end. And if you don't like that, don't take the federal money,"" Scissors said.

2021-05-26 00:00:00+00:00,2 Top Dividend Stocks for a Better Retirement,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/2-top-dividend-stocks-for-a-better-retirement-2021-05-26,,,"Retirement is when you should just sit back and enjoy life, not worry about your investments. And while there are never any guarantees as to how a stock may perform years from now, there are steps you can take and businesses you can invest in that will bring down your portfolio's risk. For starters, focusing on blue-chip companies that consistently post profits should be a given; no high-risk investing in meme stocks. And while income investments are great, you should focus on dividend stocks that also increase their payouts.
Two stocks that fit those criteria today are Bristol Myers Squibb (NYSE: BMY) and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC). Investing in both of these businesses can set you up for some great long-term returns, and make your retirement years more enjoyable.

1. Bristol Myers
Biopharmaceutical company Bristol Myers has been expanding its business recently with the acquisitions of Celgene and MyoKardia. And while that has negatively impacted its financials in the short term and increased its expenses, over the long haul that should help make the business stronger and more diverse. In 2020 the company reported an eye-popping $9 billion loss, largely due to acquisition-related expenses; in previous years, however, Bristol Myers has had no trouble staying out of the red.
For 2021 the company projects that it will get back into the black, with per-share profits coming in between $3.12 and $3.32 -- which at the midpoint would be a 60% improvement from the $2.01 earnings per share it reported in 2019. The company is also expecting that its gross margin will be extremely strong at 80.5% of revenue. In prior years, Bristol Myers was reporting margins that were around the 70% mark. And while that's still good, improving on that only makes the business look even better.
If you're a dividend investor, that's great news -- it means the company can easily support its quarterly dividend payments of $0.49, and its profit this year would put its payout ratio at around 61%, which is very manageable. And with a stronger business there's room for rate hikes, which the company has been making in recent years. In December 2020, Bristol Myers announced it was increasing its dividend for the 12th year in a row by 8.9%. Today the stock yields 2.9%, which is well above the S&P 500 average of 1.4%. On an investment of $25,000, that would produce $725 in annual income.
With a bright future ahead and lots of dividends to collect, Bristol Myers is a stock that can be a great part of any investor's portfolio, whether you are in retirement or planning for it.
2. Intel
Many top tech stocks don't pay dividends, but Intel does -- and that's what makes it a special investment. With a yield of 2.4%, it isn't far behind Bristol Myers' payout, and it has also been routinely raising its dividend payments. Today its $0.3475 quarterly payment could generate over $600 annually on a $25,000 investment. And that number could get bigger -- Intel has been raising its dividend payments regularly since 2015, and they have grown by 45% since then. And with a modest payout ratio of just 30%, there's plenty of room for the company to make more aggressive rate hikes in the future.
Intel also buys back shares. As of March 27, it still had room to repurchase another $7.2 billion under its current agreement with the board of directors. While buybacks arent dividends they help drive up the value of a stock, and through capital appreciation can give investors another way to profit from owning shares of a company.
The strength of Intel's business is what allows the company to give back so much to investors. In the past three years its net margins have come in at 26% or better, with its bottom line coming in at over $20 billion consistently. The company has also seen its free cash soar from $10 billion in 2017 to more than double that tally in 2020.
With more and more products using computer chips and a global semiconductor shortage, the chipmaker will be busy for the foreseeable future. The company is investing $20 billion to build more factories in Arizona to ramp up production. Intel expects the current shortage could take two years to address, meaning that it may miss out on some revenue along the way. But once it expands capacity, the company will be in a great position to generate even stronger numbers. In the three-month period ending March 27, its net sales of $19.7 billion were flat from the previous year.
While it will take some time for Intel to take advantage of all this demand, over the long term the stock looks to be a great buy, and could be suitable for both growth and dividend investors.

Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.

May 25 (Reuters) - Oracle Corp ORCL.N on Tuesday launched a cloud computing service powered by data center chips from Ampere Computing based on technology from Arm Ltd, the second major cloud company to offer an Arm-based service after Amazon.com's AMZN.O Amazon Web Services.
Cloud providers are some of the biggest buyers of chips because they rent out the computing power they generate to thousands of other companies. Until recently, however, almost all the chips cloud services bought came from Intel Corp INTC.O and Advanced Micro Devices AMD.O because most business software is written to run on those processors.
That began to change in 2018 when Amazon, the largest cloud provider, announced a service using its own custom chip made with intellectual property from Arm, the British firm whose technology already underlies most smartphone chips and is steadily making its way into laptops and data centers to challenge Intel and AMD.
Oracle on Tuesday joined the fray with chips from Ampere Computing, the company founded by former Intel President Renee James, who also sits on the board of Oracle. Oracle said it would rent out the chips at 1 cent per computing core per hour, less than half of what it said were its rivals' comparable rates.
""We’re at an inflection point in the industry,” Clay Magouyrk, executive vice president of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, told Reuters in an interview. ""Now that there’s a very competitive Arm product, I view my job as to offer my customers value and choice.”
Oracle also announced a range of initiatives to help expand the amount of business software that runs on Arm chips, a move that could help its rivals. Microsoft Corp MSFT.O and Alphabet Inc's GOOGL.O Google do not yet offer Arm-based cloud services to the public, but Magouyrk said he expects they will -- and that all cloud customers will eventually benefit from the competition.
""We’ll be ahead of them in that regard, but I also think they’ll have Arm offerings and they’ll be highly competitive. I view this is a multi-year process where Arm becomes ubiquitous on the server,"" Magouyrk said.

2021-05-25 00:00:00+00:00,3 Reasons Applied Materials Is More Than Just a Chip Shortage Stock,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-reasons-applied-materials-is-more-than-just-a-chip-shortage-stock-2021-05-25,,,"A global shortage of semiconductors -- basic building blocks for everything from high-tech services to autos to household appliances -- is reverberating through the economy. For semiconductor manufacturing equipment providers like Applied Materials (NASDAQ: AMAT), it's a good time to be in business. Chip fabricators are scrambling to keep up with orders and are trying to expand their production, which means strong demand for equipment. In fact, Applied Materials just posted record quarterly sales and signaled growth will continue at a torrid pace this year -- and could stay strong well beyond 2021. Here's why.
1. ""Just-in-time"" supply failed during the pandemic
As with all businesses related to manufacturing, managing supply of basic commodities is of utmost concern. While circuitry is a basic commodity used in the manufacture of all sorts of devices these days, it isn't exactly a cheap product to keep large inventories of. On the contrary, some high-end chips are quite expensive.
To manage costs, many companies keep only a short supply of chips they need on hand, and the chip fabrication industry has adapted to this ""just-in-time"" strategy. It's worked well, at least up until the pandemic. Factories around the globe have been shuttered at times due to the pandemic, and chip customers opted to work with the limited inventory they had last year to manage cash flow. But the sudden resurgence in demand for tech hardware means there's now a shortfall in supply in some sectors of the economy (like autos and some consumer electronics).
On the Q2 fiscal 2021earnings call(for the three months ended May 2, 2021), Applied Materials CEO Gary Dickerson said that ""the highly efficient, just-in-time supply chains that have served the semiconductor industry well for the past two decades may not be the most effective strategy going forward."" Fabs and their customers are now looking to expand production to create a more flexible supply chain. The result? More chip fab equipment will be needed, which plays right into the company's hands.

2. A push to increase regional manufacturing
Similar to the above initiative to increase chip production capacity, Dickerson also alluded to a global competition for more localized manufacturing. Semiconductor fabrication is a complex process, with the most advanced systems taking hundreds of steps to build. As a result, chip manufacturing hubs have been created that specialize in the process. Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE: TSM) is the largest player here, with the bulk of its operations located in Taiwan.
But various countries (most notably the world's two largest economies, the U.S. and China) are pushing for more localized production to more directly supply their silicon-hungry consumers. For example, Taiwan Semiconductor is expanding its facilities in Arizona, and rival Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) is planning an additional two in the state. Similar initiatives supported by government agencies are underway elsewhere.
For Applied Materials, this is great news. Constructing new facilities like this takes years, which will help underpin its recent surge in sales for the foreseeable future. In Q2 fiscal 2021, revenue was up 41% from a year ago to $5.58 billion. Free cash flow was up 74% to $983 million. The outlook for Q3 is even better. Revenue is expected to be $5.92 billion at the midpoint of guidance (up 6% sequentially and up 35% year over year). Given the big expected jump in sales and profits this year, shares look like a reasonable long-term value at 28 times trailing-12-month free cash flow.
3. Secular change in technology
Longer term, Applied Materials is benefiting from more than just a global chip shortage and government interest in boosting localized manufacturing. Technology itself is evolving. According to Dickerson on theearnings call
Digital transformation is driving exponential growth in data generation, which leads to the second major inflection, AI computing. New computing approaches are needed to create value from these massive volumes of data. AI computing works best with workload-specific software and hardware built from customized and entirely new types of silicon.
New types of chips designed for AI and other custom-built applications are putting new stress on the semiconductor industry. Chip fabs are purchasing new equipment to keep up with new demands for customized circuitry, but again this is a process that takes time -- in this case, perhaps a decade of rapid adoption of AI and related business processes. Demand for the fab equipment that Applied Materials supplies will ebb and flow along with manufacturing, but sales are expected to continue averaging up over time, just as they have over the last couple of decades.
Data by YCharts.
Applied Materials stock is flying high right now, up over 130% through the last 12 months. However, the global chip shortage and new technology is placing new demands on the industry. A key supplier of equipment for chip fabs around the globe, Applied Materials still looks like a quality business worth owning for the long haul.

2021-05-25 00:00:00+00:00,Danger Lurks for These 3 High-Yield Dividend Stocks,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/danger-lurks-for-these-3-high-yield-dividend-stocks-2021-05-25,,,"Many growth stocks have underperformed the market in recent months as fears of inflation have sparked a rotation toward cheaper dividend-paying stocks. However, investors shouldn't blindly buy all high-yielding stocks trading at low multiples.
IBM (NYSE: IBM), AT&T (NYSE: T), and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) might all seem like solid blue-chip dividend stocks in this market, but their high yields actually mask some serious fundamental problems. Let's see why danger could be lurking just around the corner for these three defensive stocks.
Image source: Getty Images.
1. IBM
IBM became a Dividend Aristocrat of the S&P 500 last April when it raised its annual payout for the 25th straight year. It spent just 37% of its free cash flow (FCF) on its dividend over the past 12 months, it pays a forward yield of 4.5%, and its stock looks cheap at 12 times forward earnings.
Those qualities seem to make IBM a great dividend stock, but it still underperformed the S&P 500 -- in terms of price growth and total returns (which factor in reinvested dividends) -- over the past decade.
Source: YCharts
IBM couldn't impress investors because weak demand for its older enterprise software, hardware, and IT services constantly offset the growth of its newer cloud-based services.
To streamline its core business and focus on the higher-growth hybrid cloud and AI markets, IBM plans to spin off its managed IT infrastructure services into a new company called Kyndryl later this year. IBM says the two companies will initially ""pay a combined quarterly dividend that is no less than IBM's pre-spin dividend per share"" -- but they'll both subsequently set their own dividends.
Therefore, the ""new"" IBM will likely reduce its dividend to conserve cash for other investments, but competition from other cloud giants could make it incredibly difficult for the company to turn around its massive business. Kyndryl might pay a decent dividend on its own, but the market's interest in the aging IT services business could remain tepid.
2. AT&T
AT&T, which has raised its payout for 36 straight years, is another well-known Dividend Aristocrat. It pays a forward dividend yield of 7%, it spent 57% of its FCF on those payments over the past 12 months, and the stock trades at less than ten times forward earnings. But like IBM, AT&T has broadly underperformed the S&P 500 over the past ten years.
Source: YCharts
A series of massive acquisitions over the past five years -- including DirecTV, AWS-3 spectrum licenses, and Time Warner -- caused its debt levels to skyrocket, while fragmenting its business into messy silos.
AT&T initially planned to merge its wireless, broadband, pay TV, and media segments into a vertically integrated business, but recently reversed course by selling a 30% stake in DirecTV and agreeing to spin off WarnerMedia and merge it with Discovery (NASDAQ: DISCA) (NASDAQ: DISCK).
Those abrupt decisions indicate its pay TV business is still withering, and that its media division is burning too much cash while its core 5G business is starved for fresh funds to stay competitive. But just like IBM, there's no guarantee the two new companies will fare any better than the original.
AT&T also recently said it would cut its dividend to ""account for the distribution of WarnerMedia"" after the deal closes next year. Therefore, investors looking for stable income should cross AT&T off their lists.
3. Intel
Intel is the world's largest manufacturer of x86 CPUs for PCs and data centers, and it pays a forward yield of 2.5% while trading at just 12 times forward earnings. It's raised its payout for seven straight years, and it spent just 29% of its FCF on those payments over the past 12 months. Intel generated a better total return than IBM and AT&T over the past decade, but it still failed to beat the market.
Source: YCharts
But that's not Intel's biggest problem. Over the past several years, Intel has fallen behind TSMC, the world's most advanced chip foundry, in the ""process race"" to create smaller and more powerful chips.
Intel produces most of its own chips, but rival AMD outsources its production to TSMC. As a result, AMD now produces more advanced chips than Intel, while Intel has constantly tripped over its own feet with chip shortages and R&D blunders.
Many of Intel's critics believe the chipmaker should follow AMD's lead and become a fabless chipmaker. However, Intel recently doubled down by expanding its foundries, which will eventually provide services to third-party chipmakers amid the global semiconductor shortage.
That expansion already includes a $20 billion investment in two new plants in Arizona, and it plans to build more plants across the U.S. and Europe. Intel will receive some support from government subsidies, but it could sacrifice its dividend -- which consumed $5.6 billion in cash last year -- to accelerate those ambitions. Therefore, investors shouldn't consider Intel to be a stable dividend stock right now.

In early 2002, as America was reeling from the dot.com stock crash, as the New England Patriots enjoyed their first Super Bowl win, and as A Beautiful Mind won the Best Picture Oscar, an unusual-looking can began appearing in stores…
The can contained a product called “Monster Energy.”
Source: Monster Energy
Monster Energy is sold as an energy-boosting drink, full of sugar, caffeine, and other stimulants. If you’re over 60 years old, chances are good you’ve never tried it. You stick to coffee. But in the early 2000s, Monster Energy became a phenomenon with 20- and 30-somethings. For many young people, energy drinks like Monster became “their coffee” and “their Coca-Cola.”
Thanks to this huge shift in consumer tastes, the maker of Monster Energy saw its revenue from drinks skyrocket from $50 million in 2003 to $1.7 billion in 2011, a 34-fold increase.
The iron law of the stock market says that if a company massively grows its sales and earnings grow, then its stock price will massively grow as well. So, it’s no wonder the maker of Monster Energy — a small firm named Hansen Natural — saw its shares skyrocket in the mid-2000s.
I’m more familiar with the Monster Energy story than most. Readers of my Breakthrough Stocks newsletter were on board with the stock and took the ride of their lives. From my original buy recommendation of the stock in January 1, 2004, to our sell alert on June 1 2007, we made an incredible 1,125%.
That kind of gain changes lives.
It buys lake houses, Ferraris and a dozen vacations. It turns a $15,000 investment into $183,750… a $35,000 investment into $428,750… and a $50,000 investment into $612,500.
Every decade, no matter what is happening with the economy, dozens of stocks climb by more than 1,000%.
Often, these “super performance” stocks are America’s greatest corporate success stories.
The popular coffee chain, Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX), for example gained 1,807% during the 1990s.
The now-famous semiconductor maker Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) gained 6,556% during the same time.
Then you have the 1980s. This decade saw the fast-growing retail chain Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) gain 4,185%. Another fast-growing retail chain, The Gap, Inc. (NYSE:GPS), gained 5,539%.
As you can see, “super-performance stocks” come in many forms.
Sometimes they are innovative restaurant chains with great new concepts.
Sometimes they are high-tech firms that change the world through their innovations.
Sometimes they are fast-growing new retail chains.
The business models these winners employ have their differences, but the cash profits reaped by shareholders are the same.
The profit earned from a stock that climbs 500%… 1,000%… even 1,500% can add an extra $10,000… $100,000… even $1 million to your net worth.
The allure of making huge profits has drawn people to the stock market for over a century. And although many people search for stocks with 1,000%-plus potential, few find them.
The reason for this failure is simple.
Instead of using a proven, repeatable strategy for pinpointing the world’s best growth stocks, most people take the amateur’s approach. They use gut instincts and follow “hot tips” from other amateurs.
They employ different strategies randomly. They flutter from strategy to strategy like butterflies. And they end up with crudely constructed, messy portfolios.
Today, I’m going to show you how to succeed where others fail.
I’ve always been a numbers and data junkie… and I love the stock market. So, many years ago, I conducted a huge study of the biggest stock market winners in American history. I wanted to determine the qualities of the biggest stock market winners — before they went on their giant, life-changing runs.
Through hundreds of hours of work and exhaustive computerized data analysis, I found that stocks poised to climb 10-fold… 20-fold… even 50-fold exhibit some unique financial characteristics.
I found that incredible success leaves “fingerprints.”
My findings have changed my life and the lives of many others. Although I started from humble beginnings, I’ve made more money than I ever care to spend (although I’ve spent a lot on sports cars, one of my other passions). I’ve helped many regular Americans make huge returns in the stock market.
I want you to have that, too, so I’m going to show you how to find super-performance stocks that can make you 1,000%+ gains. I’ll detail my common-sense method for profiting in the market’s fastest-growing, highest-performance small-cap stocks.
You’ll learn how to find them… how to buy them… and the characteristics they share.
The ideas I’ll cover are what made me “an icon among growth investors” according to The New York Times. And “one of Wall Street’s most renowned growth investors” according to Forbes.
And more important than press clippings, my proven system for picking stocks directed my readers to Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) when it was trading at the equivalent of just $4 a share…
…Along with Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) during the early 2000s, long before it became the largest retailer in the world.
Then there’s my early recommendation of Google, now called Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL,NASDAQ:GOOG), which numerous media outlets have written and talked about over the years…
Including newsletter industry watchdog Mark Hulbert of MarketWatch, who credited me with being “the analyst who recommended Google before anyone else.”
Most importantly, the proven system I’m about to share with you has made my clients and readers a great deal of money over the past 37 years. I’m confident they can help you do the same.

2021-05-24 00:00:00+00:00,"Intel, SK Hynix Win EU Approval for Memory Unit Sale",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intel-sk-hynix-win-eu-approval-for-memory-unit-sale-2021-05-24,,,"Intel (INTC) and SK Hynix have moved closer to completing their memory and storage business transaction after securing EU approval. Intel is an American semiconductor company that primarily makes processor chips used in personal computers, data centers, vehicles, and other items. SK Hynix is a South Korean memory chipmaker. 
Intel agreed to sell its NAND memory business to SK Hynix for $9 billion in October 2020. NAND is the most common type of flash memory, used in storage devices such as USB flash cards. The deal had already been approved in the U.S., and now it has been cleared in the EU. SK Hynix noted in a press release that the EU cleared the deal without attaching any conditions. 
SK Hynix and Intel are waiting for approvals in other countries before they can close the transaction. They hope to secure the pending approvals this year.
SK Hynix expects Intel's memory unit acquisition to expand its global footprint in the memory market. It also believes the acquisition will enhance its expertise and allow it to deliver more breakthrough memory products to its customers.
Intel allowed SK Hynix to pay for the memory unit purchase in two phases. The first payment will be $7 billion, and the remaining $2 billion will be paid in 2025 with the final closing. The memory unit sale is expected to allow Intel to invest in long-term growth priorities. (See Intel stock analysis on TipRanks)
Northland Securities analyst Gus Richard reiterated a Sell rating with a price target of $42 on Intel stock. Richard’s price target implies 25.11% downside potential from the current price.
“INTC is not dead, just severely wounded from self-inflicted injuries over the last couple of decades…but it can be fixed in our opinion,” noted Richard.
Consensus among analysts on Wall Street is a Hold based on 12 Buy, 10 Hold, and 9 Sell ratings. The average analyst price target of $65.52 implies 16.83% upside potential to current levels.
INTC scores an 8 out of 10 on TipRanks’ Smart Score rating system, indicating the stock is likely to outperform the market.

That's not surprising coming out of the pandemic, but after peaking earlier this month, stocks have been heading lower.
Greater volatility could signal we are poised for a spring market correction, and if you have $1,000 to invest you may be leery about putting it to work for you in the stock market. But that just means you need to be more careful about where you invest. The two stocks below should be considered for the next stock market crash.
Image source: Getty Images.
1. Walmart
Walmart's (NYSE: WMT) first-quarter earnings report highlights its retail dominance. Not only is its physical presence overwhelming, but its e-commerce business continues to drive its expansion. Online sales grew another 37% compared to the year-ago first quarter, which captured just the start of the wave of pandemic-driven shopping.
It will now be facing tougher comparables because it was deemed an essential business and allowed to operate while its specialty retail competitors were forced to close. But its rivals are much weaker financially as a result of the government closing them down, while Walmart is flush with cash, having $22.8 billion sitting in the bank.
Walmart is worried it is losing ground to Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN), but the reports that Amazon will be bigger than Walmart within a few years are skewed because they're counting all of the e-commerce giant's third-party sellers in the mix, while Walmart is largely a solo operation.
Its grocery sales did fall year over year in the first quarter, but the panic buying the pandemic launched made a decline all but inevitable. Walmart still owns an estimated quarter of the grocery market and had $341 billion in grocery sales last year. Second-place Kroger, the largest pure-play supermarket, is a distant second with about a 10% share and some $122 billion in 2020 sales.
A spring market correction will not likely faze this retail giant.
2. Apple
Once again Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) proved the naysayers wrong, absolutely crushing Wall Street estimates on the strength of sales of the iPhone 12, iPad, and Mac computers.
Analysts had said demand for iPhones was waning ahead of the earnings report, but Apple reported sales surged 66% in the quarter. The upgrade cycle provided a tremendous tailwind for the tech giant, but analysts are saying now is when demand will fall off. Wall Street has a penchant for always thinking consumers have had their fill of Apple products, and Apple continuously proves them wrong.
Yet demand was at record levels during the period, fueling double-digit growth across all categories in all of its geographic segments. CFO Luca Maestri said consumers were ""driving our installed base of active devices to an all-time high."" Apple, it seems, has perfected its new product launches to coincide with the need for upgrades fueling supercycle trends that continuously boost sales.
Because Apple has also developed its proprietary M1 chip, which reduces its reliance upon Intel, it has also avoided many of the delays and disruptions that are plaguing its competitors due to the industry chip shortage.
iPad sales were up 79% this past quarter, and the latest versions with the M1 are likely going on sale this summer, which will undoubtedly fuel further gains and pad the near-$8 billion in sales it just made.
Apple also pays investors a very modest dividend that currently yields 0.7%. That's not going to attract very many income-seeking investors, but any decline in its stock price from a market downdraft can be at least partially ameliorated by the payout.
With over $38.4 billion in cash sitting in the bank, the dividend is safe and otherwise adds to the rationale for parking your $1,000 in its stock.

2021-05-21 00:00:00+00:00,Is Advanced Micro Devices Stock a Buy?,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/is-advanced-micro-devices-stock-a-buy-2021-05-21,,,"In spite of a global chip shortage and soaring sales, Advanced Micro Devices' (NASDAQ: AMD) stock price has declined by over 21% from all-time highs registered in mid-January. The tech stock sell-off has taken a bite out of this fast-growing semiconductor name, and even a stellar first-quarter earnings report wasn't enough to rekindle investor optimism.
AMD may not stay down for long, though. Armed with a revamped lineup of microchips and picking up steam across its product portfolio, this looks like a solid buy as it continues to make inroads against its peers.
A great start to 2021
Executing a successful turnaround story, especially in the technology universe where innovation is a constant and never-ending battle, is easier said than done. But that's just what AMD has done. More than a decade removed from the spinoff of its chip manufacturing segment GlobalFoundries, years of research and development is starting to pay off. Sales have been up across the product portfolio for PCs, laptops, and data centers as AMD makes hay while Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) has stumbled as of late. And Microsoft's Xbox Series X and Sony's Playstation 5 selling like hotcakes was also a positive as AMD provided custom circuitry for both next-gen video game consoles.
Image source: Getty Images.
Specifically, in the first quarter of 2021, the computing and graphics segment was just over 60% of sales and grew 46% year over year. Enterprise, embedded, and semi-custom chips (including data centers, networking, and the custom designs for the new Xbox and Playstation consoles) made up the balance of sales and surged 286% higher year over year. That segment also turned an operating profit in the first quarter, compared to an operating loss a year ago. All told, AMD had a fantastic start to 2021, especially considering it's building on the 45% sales increase it notched in full-year 2020.

The good times are expected to keep rolling this year as the global chip shortage is creating more sales outlets than manufacturers can provide for. It isn't a great situation for businesses that need chips to build higher-order products (like computers, autos, and industrial equipment), but it certainly is for chip designers like AMD. The company expects second-quarter sales to increase another 86% year over year and full-year sales to be up about 50% over full-year 2020.
An opportunistic acquisition
During its evolution over the last decade, profit margins at AMD have been far lower than semiconductor industry peers. But the revamped product portfolio is starting to pay off. Operating profit margin was 16% in first-quarter 2021, still below the mid-20% range of the biggest chip designers out there, but AMD is well on its way to delivering healthy margins on its sales.
Data by YCharts.
The takeover of Xilinx (NASDAQ: XLNX) will bolster these efforts. Xilinx is the leader in field-programmable gate array (FPGA) chips, and its combination with AMD will make the company an even scrappier thorn in Intel's side -- especially in the tech infrastructure and data center industries. Intel bolstered its FPGA presence with the acquisition of Altera in 2015 and Omnitek in 2019.
Besides strengthening the overall portfolio of semiconductors, Xilinx will also be a highly profitable addition to AMD. Its free cash flow profit margin was an enviable 33% of revenue in its recently completed fiscal year and will more than double AMD's annual free cash flow (Xilinx generated $1.04 billion in free cash flow the last 12 months). Xilinx will thus bolster AMD's research and development spend as well as raise the company's profitability overall.
Excluding Xilinx from the equation, AMD stock looks like a long-term value right now. Shares trade for 53 times trailing 12-month free cash flow and 35 times 2021 expected earnings per share. It's growing sales well into the double digits, has rising profit margins, and is opportunistically increasing its market share while Intel tries to revamp its business model. NVIDIA's (NASDAQ: NVDA) expanding product portfolio centered on scooping up more share of data center designs might pose a threat down the road, but for now, both companies are growing at an incredible clip as they encroach on the turf Intel is vacating in the enterprise networking and cloud computing industry.
With 2021 off to a great start, I say AMD stock is a top buy in the semiconductor space.

Despite the turmoil on Main Street, the U.S. stock market remained resilient throughout the pandemic and beyond. There are several reasons for this phenomenon. First, the Fed slashed interest rates to stave off recessionary pressure. And second, the U.S. government provided much-needed stimuli packages to keep businesses afloat. In fact, multiples are so high that there is a constant fear a stock market crash is right around the corner. Against this backdrop, finding undervalued stocks becomes a difficult task.
However, we have carefully curated a list of the best stocks in the market trading at steep discounts relative to the S&P 500. It is also important to note that all of these stocks are stable performers, with strong positions in their respective markets. So it’s not like you will buy these just because they are cheap.

7 Industrial Stocks to Buy for a Rock-Solid Foundation
So, without further ado, here are seven names at an attractive price point:
Dollar General (NYSE:DG)
Honda Motor (NYSE:HMC)
Intel (NASDAQ:INTC)
WWE (NYSE:WWE)
Alibaba (NYSE:BABA)
KeyCorp (NYSE:KEY)
Toyota (NYSE:TM)
Undervalued Stocks to Buy: Dollar General (DG)

Forward P/E Discount Relative to the S&P 500: 56% Discount
Dollar General is one of the best-undervalued stocks out there. DG stock is down 3.2% year-to-date, which may come off as surprising, considering the solid track record of this leading American discount retailer, particularly during the pandemic.
In fiscal year 2020, net sales jumped 21.6% to $33.7 billion compared to $27.8 billion in the year-ago period, and diluted EPS increased 59.9% to $10.62 from $6.64 in fiscal 2019. One of the main reasons the company always does well is that most revenue is derived from selling essential items with strong all-weather demand.
However, the retailer is conscious that it needs to keep diversifying. As a result, Dollar General is launching Popshelf to target women shoppers in “diverse suburban communities” with an income bracket between $50,000 and $125,000 through non-consumable items, 95% of which will be under $5. Dollar General’s strategy is to expand outside its traditional core consumer base while keeping its core customers happy.
Honda Motor (HMC)

Forward P/E Discount Relative to the S&P 500: 81% Discount
It seems difficult to advocate for Honda Motor in a world where Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is the biggest car company in the world by market capitalization. There is so much going on in the electric vehicle (EV) sector these days. And that is fueling immense demand for quality EV stocks. But it is important to remember that EVs still sell a quarter of the motor vehicles of traditional automakers.
In fiscal year 2020, Honda, one of the largest conglomerates globally, generated approximately 14.9 trillion Japanese yen in revenue, selling 4.8 million automobiles. In comparison, Tesla delivered nearly 500,000 vehicles in 2020. That is respectable, considering we are at the cusp of the EV revolution. But it highlights the gulf between traditional automakers and Elon Musk’s billion-dollar baby.

7 High Quality Industrial Stocks to Buy Now
Besides, if you look at Honda Motor’s fundamentals, there is no reason why shares should not be skyrocketing. Plus, it’s not like Honda does not have its own set of EV offerings. Yet, as of this writing, the stock is up just 6% in the last three months, a travesty, in my opinion.
Undervalued Stocks to Buy: Intel (INTC)

Forward P/E Discount Relative to the S&P 500: 72% Discount
Intel is part of a select group of companies dominating the semiconductor industry. That group includes Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and AMD (NASDAQ:AMD), both generating more buzz than Intel, the more established name out there.
Truth be told, there is more than one thing that makes a good stock. First, of course, valuation matters a lot, especially when you consider the multiples at which Nvidia and AMD are trading. However, when you look in totality, Intel is the world’s largest chipmaker and one of the most solid performers. According to CNBC data, the American multinational corporation and technology company has beat expectations 11 times in the last twelve quarters. If that does not scream consistency, then I don’t know what does.
It’s also crucial to note how awesome the company is in terms of payout. For the last six years, the company has consistently hiked its dividend. A payout of 29.95% might seem conservative, but we are talking about a very cash-rich company that is consistently looking to plow back resources into its operations to make sure it keeps pace with its peers.
WWE (WWE)

Trailing P/E Discount Relative to the S&P 500: 31% Discount
Market sentiment is down on WWE stock lately, with shares shedding 4.5% of value last month. For the unfamiliar, WWE is a professional wrestling company that produces television programming and live wrestling events. Professional wrestling had two boom periods. First in 1985, then again in 1998. Each period helped the business set records for a few years, then evaporated.
Now, you would be forgiven for thinking that the heyday for this sport is over. But the thing to remember here is that the WWE has an impressive inbuilt audience. That is why NBC Universal and Fox paid millions to acquire exclusive rights for their programming in multimillion-dollar deals.
WWE also has a ten-year deal for two events per year, running from 2018 to 2027 in Saudi Arabia, which will provide the company with approximately $100 million in revenue per year. It should help you understand that the brainchild of Vince McMahon has several diversified forms of revenue.
EPS has jumped by 43.9% and revenue at 5.8% in the last three years, very respectable numbers. In the last 12 quarters, WWE has reported nine “positive” earnings surprises per Refinitiv data. Looking ahead, analysts tracked by the company expect the top line to increase 11.6% and 27.5% in fiscal 2021 and 2022, respectively.

Undervalued Stocks to Buy: Alibaba (BABA)

Trailing P/E Discount Relative to the S&P 500: 44% Discount
Alibaba stock has a rare bad run, falling almost 18% in the last three months. For me, the price trajectory is perplexing.
Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alibaba are both e-commerce giants. Amazon dominates the American shopping space, while Alibaba does the same in China. However, Amazon rarely suffers from the kind of price correction that BABA suffers from time to time. You have to chalk that down to the company’s symbiotic relationship with the Chinese administration.
For example, the Xi Jinping administration recently levied a $2.8 billion fine against the Chinese tech giant for antitrust violations. The weirdest part? We saw a bump in the markets immediately following the news. The logic is simple. Although the fine is substantial, the Chinese multinational technology company holds massive cash reserves, and a $2.8 billion outflow will not cause management any sleepless nights.
In fact, shareholders were happy that BABA escaped with a mere rap on the knuckles. However, the message is loud and clear. The Chinese government is not afraid to take strict regulatory action on a domestic company as big as BABA.
The price correction aside, there is little to suggest BABA is anything but a good investment. The company’s revenues increased nearly 30% in 2020, and according to Refinitiv data, consensus estimates are estimating growth rates of 30.6% in 2022 and 57.8% in 2023. That kind of success is hard to come by. That is why it’s strange that BABA is trading at 21.3 times forward price-to-earnings. But that should provide you with plenty of incentive to buy this stock.
eBay (EBAY)

Trailing P/E Discount Relative to the S&P 500: 63% Discount
eBay and Amazon are two of the earliest American e-commerce success stories. However, the path for both these companies has diverged significantly in the last few years.
While Amazon has gone from strength to strength, eBay has struggled to gain traction and remain relevant. But the American multinational e-commerce corporation has grown respectably in the shadow of its larger peers. In particular, the pandemic has acted as a boon for the company offering consumer-to-consumer and business-to-consumer sales through its website.
In the last four quarters, the company beat Wall Street expectations from analysts, a sound turnaround. The top line increased by 42%, to $3 billion, in the first quarter, and annual active buyers grew 7%, 187 million customers, and annual active sellers grew 8%, to 20 million. eBay forecasts revenue figures in Q2 to remain in line with Q1.

10 Dividend Aristocrat Stocks for Your Reliability Short List
Despite all this positive momentum, EBAY stock is still trading at 15.5 times forward P/E while Amazon is at 54.6 times forward P/E. When you consider all these factors, it is not surprising that this name is on this list of undervalued stocks.
Undervalued Stocks to Buy: Toyota (TM)

Trailing P/E Discount Relative to the S&P 500: 75% Discount
Much like Honda, Toyota seems to be out of fashion due to the bigger EV heavy hitters out there. But there are still plenty of reasons to remain bullish on Toyota.
The Japanese multinational automotive manufacturer has outstanding fundamentals and a stable position in the market, making it a conservative yet attractive play. In fiscal 2020, it managed to sell 10.5 million units, a very respectable return considering we were smack dab in the middle of a global pandemic.
Toyota holds a market share in Japan of approximately 49%, while the U.S. share is nearly 14.5%. When analyzing TM, it’s also important to understand that this is a highly diversified company with a very successful financing arm and investments in Denso, a parts supplier, Subaru (OTCMKTS:FUJHY), Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER), Mazda Motor (OTCMKTS:MZDAY), and Suzuki.
Considering its solid foundations, it is amazing that Toyota trades at P/E and price-to-book ratios substantially lower than the automotive sector and the S&P 500. So snap it up before this changes.

2021-05-20 00:00:00+00:00,EU says its ready to invest 'significant' funds in chip sector,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/eu-says-its-ready-to-invest-significant-funds-in-chip-sector-2021-05-20,,,"By Toby Sterling
AMSTERDAM, May 20 (Reuters) - The EU is ready to commit ""significant"" funds to expand European semiconductor manufacturing and support its computer chip supply chain, the Commissioner for internal markets, Thierry Breton, said on Thursday.
After a meeting at the headquarters of key industry equipment supplier ASML ASML.AS, Breton said Europe would need to expand its capacity to build mid-level chips before it could achieve a goal of doubling its share of global semiconductor production to 20% and producing the most advanced, 2-nanometer chips by 2030.
In April, Reuters reported the EU was launching an ""alliance"" of European semiconductor companies including ASML as well as Infineon IFXGn.DE, STM STM.BN and NXP NXPI.O to help meet those goals.
Breton said that alliance would be comparable to plans by the U.S., China, South Korea to support their domestic chipmakers and repeated that he hopes to attract one of the big three global chipmakers, Taiwan Semiconductor 2330.TW, Samsung 005930.KS of South Korea or Intel INTC.O of the U.S., to build a cutting-edge plant in Europe.
Breton said that funding could come from several EU programs including its 800 billion euro ($975 billion) coronavirus recovery fund, of which 20% is meant to be spent on the continent's ""digital transition""
""We are not in a position where we are dying for (foreign chipmakers) to come, we are in a position where we want to offer them the opportunity to come, to invest in our continent and to enhance the security of supply,"" Breton said.
""Hopefully we will be able to move quickly, and when I say quickly - it's a matter of months not years.""
ASML boss Peter Wennink said it made sense for Europe to start supporting research and developing infrastructure now for industry segments that will be important in 5 years, and where European companies already have strengths, in automotive chips and in ""edge computing.""

2021-05-20 00:00:00+00:00,"Today's Tech Sell-Off: Where to Invest $5,000 for the Next 5 Years",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/todays-tech-sell-off%3A-where-to-invest-%245000-for-the-next-5-years-2021-05-20,,,"The Nasdaq-100 Technology Sector index has retreated more than 7% in the past month, bringing down the valuations of some fast-growing names in tech that were considered overvalued earlier. But one shouldn't forget that this same index has jumped more than 240% in the past five years, which means that a $5,000 investment in the index would be worth $17,000 now.
Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) stock has done even better over five years, rising over 1,850% and turning $5,000 into nearly $100,000. Rival graphics card specialist NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) has soared over 1,200% over a similar period. Both stocks have pulled back thanks to the tech sell-off, but these two stocks could deliver outsized gains over the next five years as well, thanks to the catalysts they are sitting on. Let's find out why.
Image source: Getty Images.
1. Advanced Micro Devices
AMD's fortunes have changed big time over the past five years. A competitive product lineup has allowed it to take market share away from Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) in the x86 processor market, a trend that's expected to continue in the next five years.
AMD data by YCharts
AMD has made solid progress in the PC market through its Ryzen CPUs (central processing units) and Radeon GPUs (graphics processing units). According to the latest data from Steam Hardware Survey for April, AMD now controls almost 29.5% of the PC CPU space. It controlled 25% of the market in December 2020, with Intel holding the rest. Steam data is a credible source for PC market share information, as the platform is used by 120 million monthly active users worldwide.
Meanwhile, Mercury Research estimates that AMD's desktop PC market share increased to 19.3% at the end of the first quarter, up from just 11.4% four years ago. It also holds 18% of the mobile CPU market. AMD's CPU market share is expected to jump as high as 50% in 2021 as per Wall Street. This doesn't seem surprising given the technology advantage AMD enjoys over Intel, as well as Chipzilla's troubles with getting its latest chips out of the gate.
AMD has also turned on the heat in the laptop market. The company's Ryzen 5000 mobile processors are expected to power 50% more models this year and pave the way for more market share gains.
Meanwhile, AMD has made solid progress in the server processor market, finishing Q1 with an 8.9% share. It was nowhere to be seen in server processors four years ago, but the arrival of the EPYC chips has given it a big shot in the arm. AMD is poised to take away more market share from Intel in servers in the coming years and could make billions of dollars from this space.
On the other hand, the arrival of the latest gaming consoles from Sony and Microsoft that are powered by AMD's chips is moving the needle in a big way for the chipmaker. The PlayStation 5 has sold 7.8 million units so far. It is expected to sell over 200 million units over its lifetime, according to an analyst at Japanese firm Rakuten Securities, as compared to 116 million units of the previous generation PS4.
What's more, AMD is reportedly getting 80% more revenue from each unit of the PS5 over the PS4. So, a combination of higher shipments and stronger revenue from each gaming console should unlock a massive revenue opportunity for the company in the long run. Not surprisingly, analysts expect AMD to deliver almost 30% annual earnings growth over the next five years -- making it a top growth stock where one can park $5,000 right now, given that it is trading at less than 28 times forward earnings.
2. NVIDIA
NVIDIA has come a long way in the past five years. The chipmaker has branched out into several fast-growing applications such as data centers, artificial intelligence, autonomous cars, and 5G wireless networks from supplying graphics cards for gaming PCs.
NVDA data by YCharts
Gaming continues to be NVIDIA's biggest source of revenue, accounting for 46% of its top line last fiscal year. The segment's revenue was up 41% in fiscal 2021 to $7.7 billion, thanks to the launch of NVIDIA's new RTX 30 series graphics cards, which have set the sales charts on fire by triggering a massive upgrade cycle.
NVIDIA estimates that 85% of its installed base is yet to upgrade to the RTX series cards, which pack a huge performance bump at aggressive price points over prior generation cards. That's a huge opportunity, as NVIDIA's installed base of gaming graphics cards stands at 140 million. More importantly, the company's new GPUs are driving an increase in the average selling price (ASP).
The latest Ampere-based GPUs recorded an ASP of $360 in the first six months of their launch thanks to an increase in the proportion of customers buying higher-priced cards. That's 20% higher than the previous generation Turing cards that had an ASP of $300 in the initial six months, and well above the $245 ASP of the Pascal cards that were released five years ago.

So, NVIDIA's gaming business could keep growing at a terrific pace over the next five years thanks to a combination of strong volumes and improved pricing. Jon Peddie Research estimates that 41.5 million discrete GPUs were sold in 2020, and NVIDIA dominated this market with a share of 82% at the end of the year. This bodes well for NVIDIA's future, as the GPU market is expected to clock annual growth of nearly 34% through 2027 as per third-party estimates.
Beyond gaming, NVIDIA is sitting on huge opportunities in nascent markets such as self-driving cars. The company has struck several partnerships in this space and has already lined up automotive design wins worth $8 billion for the next five years. This figure could keep growing thanks to NVIDIA's solid product roadmap, which indicates that it is working on more powerful self-driving platforms that should hit the market in the coming years.
Throw in the fact that NVIDIA's terrific growth in the data center market won't be fading any time soon, and investors will have one more reason to hold on to this tech titan. The data center business generated $6.7 billion in revenue in FY21, up 124% year over year. It accounted for 40% of the total revenue. NVIDIA is now branching out into new areas to ensure that this business keeps growing at elevated rates.
It recently announced the Grace CPU, a server processor that's expected to go on sale in 2023. This would be new territory for NVIDIA, and success here could supercharge the company's data center business, as the server processor market is expected to be worth $19 billion by 2023.
So, NVIDIA still has a lot of room for growth. Analysts forecast 20%-plus annual earnings growth for the next five years, though NVIDIA could do better if the new opportunities it is attacking bear fruit. In all, NVIDIA looks like a top stock where investors can park $5,000, as it is set for multi-year growth and trades at an attractive 36 times forward earnings as compared to 2020's average multiple of 46.

2021-05-20 00:00:00+00:00,5 Large-Cap Stocks With High Upside Potential,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/5-large-cap-stocks-with-high-upside-potential-2021-05-20,,,"The first-quarter earnings season has been a remarkable one for the S&P 500 and its cadre of large-cap stocks. More than 85% of the S&P 500's components have exceeded Wall Street's profit expectations.
However, much of the past quarter's growth was driven by monetary and fiscal stimulus. That's a problem, because the Federal Reserve will take its foot off the pedal at some point, and the president's latest initiative – to invest heavily in the nation's infrastructure – is no guarantee to pass in Congress.
In other words, many of the companies that excited Wall Street this quarter could be in for a rude awakening as the drivers of their growth dry up.
Investors should instead be focused on companies that can generate high upside potential on their own merits. And one way to target such growth (without sticking your neck out too far) is to focus on large-cap stocks. That's because large caps are capable of producing ample upside but also typically have better financial means to withstand market shocks compared to smaller-value stocks investors often chase for growth.
If you're looking for a place to start, consider these five large-cap stocks with high upside potential. We started with a universe of stocks that earn a Buy rating in the Stock News POWR Ratings system, which measures dozens of fundamental metrics to assess the quality of a stock. We then tapped the wisdom of the analyst community, as these researchers can provide in-depth insights into any company's current financial situation and future prospects. In this case, the pros expect each of these stocks to appreciate by at least 20% over the next 12 months or so.

Cadence Design Systems
Market value: $34.2 billion
POWR ratings: B (Buy)
Potential upside: 24%
Cadence Design Systems (CDNS, $122.32) offers products and tools that help its customers design electronic products. It specializes in developing software, hardware and intellectual property that automates the design and verification of integrated circuits or larger chip systems.
Historically, semiconductor firms have used Cadence's tools, but the company is now providing solutions for the Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence, autonomous vehicles and cloud computing, too.
Sign up for Kiplinger's FREE Investing Weekly e-letter for stock, ETF and mutual fund recommendations, and other investing advice.
A key growth catalyst has been Cadence's expanding product portfolio and frequent product launches. CDNS has invested in verification and digital design products so it can launch new products that address the needs of electronic and semiconductor companies. This expanding portfolio of products has put the company in front of new customer bases; for instance, autonomous vehicles have become an important growth area.
Indeed, CFRA analyst John Freeman cites ""continued successful expansion into systems design/analysis, enhanced by recent acquisitions of Pointwise in system analysis and Numeca in fluid dynamics"" as one of several reasons he recently upgraded shares from a mere Buy to Strong Buy.
CDNS is witnessing strong demand for its software from customers that provide datacenter servers, networking products, and smartphones. Its expansion into emerging trends such as IoT, augmented and virtual reality, presents a huge growth opportunity for Cadence long term as enterprises continue to spend on these emerging technologies.
Fueling the POWR Ratings' system's B grade (Buy) is a high Sentiment Grade of B. Eight of the 14 analysts covering the stock call it a Buy or Strong Buy, versus just four Holds and two Sells (and no Strong Sells). Meanwhile, an average price target of $151.98 implies roughly 24% upside from current levels.
A major draw of large-cap stocks is more reliable financials, and that's certainly the case for CDNS. The stock gets a Quality Grade of A thanks to a sterling balance sheet that features $743 million in cash and equivalents, which is more than twice its $347 million in long-term debt. Meanwhile, its most recent total debt to total capital of 12% was lower than the prior quarter's figure.
Strong cash flow allowed the company to continue its share repurchases, as CDNS repurchased $172 million in stock in the first quarter. See the complete POWR Ratings for Cadence (CDNS) here.

Apple
Market value: $2.1 trillion
POWR ratings: B (Buy)
Potential upside: 28%
Apple (AAPL, $124.69) is the king of U.S. large-cap stocks. You simply cannot buy a larger company on American exchanges, at the moment, than Apple, which currently is worth more than $2 trillion by market value.
The company recently reported earnings that destroyed analyst estimates. Its product revenue rose 62% year-over-year, driven by strong demand for its iPhone, iPad and Mac product lines. Mac computers also set an all-time revenue record. This was driven by the company's custom-built M1 chip that replaced Intel (INTC) processors in the Mac Mini and MacBook.
Apple's Services segment also delivered record results in the quarter. While the company's business runs through its flagship iPhone, its Services offerings – including cloud services, App Store, Apple Music, AppleCare and Apple Pay – are the new cash cow for the company. AAPL currently has more than 660 million paid subscribers across its total services portfolio. Its subscription-based video streaming, gaming services and news should benefit from its strong base of customers.
The company dominates the Wearables markets due to the growing adoption of the Apple Watch and AirPods. Interest in the Apple Watch has created an opening for the company to strengthen its presence in the health monitoring space. And the pandemic has been a boon to Apple Pay, which is being used in more than 150 stadiums, ballparks, and entertainment venues worldwide.
Still, the workhorse of Apple remains its iPhone, whose sunny outlook has UBS urging investors to buy the stock.
""UBS Evidence Lab recently surveyed over 7,000 smartphone users in the U.S., U.K., China, Germany, and Japan to gauge smartphone demand,"" UBS analysts write. ""The three key takeaways from the survey pertaining to Apple are 1) iPhone 12-month purchase intent increased to 22%, the highest level in 5 years, 2) iPhone retention rate reached 86%, the highest level in seven years, and 3) Interest in 5G modestly improved, consistent with Apple's view of 'the early days of 5G ... with a lot of 5G upgrades will be in front of us.'""
AAPL has an overall grade of B, which is a Buy in POWR Ratings' book. Lifting that rating is a Sentiment Grade of A, which makes sense given strong analyst consensus around the stock. Eighteen of 24 analysts rate Apple surveyed by Stock News rate the stock a Buy, and a $159.74 average price target implies that within 12 months, Apple's stock will be worth 28% more than it is now.
And naturally, Apple is well-known for its bulletproof balance sheet, which earns AAPL a Quality Grade of B. As of the end of March, Apple had $69.8 billion in cash, compared with only $13 billion in short-term debt. Plus, AAPL has a sky-high return on equity of 110.3% and a return on invested capital of 41.4%. To see the complete POWR Ratings analysis for Apple (AAPL), click here.

Qualcomm
Market value: $148.1 billion
POWR ratings: B (Buy)
Potential upside: 31%
Qualcomm (QCOM, $130.66) develops and licenses wireless technology and designs chips for smartphones. The company is a big player in making chips for 5G phones, which makes sense as the company had previously provided chips for 3G and 4G networks. Its new chips enable 5G communication in smartphones, modems, and IoT devices that link to cars.
QCOM also has a patent business that collects licensing fees from other companies that want to use Qualcomm's wireless technology patents. For instance, QCOM has a chipset supply agreement with Apple, where AAPL will likely license the chips directly from Qualcomm instead of relying on original equipment manufacturers. The firm also has a new patent license agreement with Huawei.
Qualcomm should benefit from strong momentum in the handset space due to the ongoing shift toward 5G. And consumers are shifting. In 2021, 5G handsets are expected to see 150% year-over-year growth.
""We believe that Qualcomm has barely begun to monetize its significant intellectual capital and multigenerational lead in 5G technology,"" writes Argus Research analyst Jim Kelleher, who rates the stock at Buy. ""As the 5G ramp moves from mainly infrastructure investment to the mass adoption of 5G handsets, we continue to look for a significant boost to revenue, margins, and EPS.""
The company also has unveiled the first-of-its-kind automotive platform, Snapdragon Ride, which enables automakers to transform their cars into self-driving automobiles using AI.
Stock News' POWR Ratings system gives Qualcomm a B grade, indicating a Buy rating. Among the reasons to like QCOM are its strong growth prospects (reflected in a Growth Grade of B). Qualcomm's earnings are up 106.2% over the past year, and current-quarter estimates are for a whopping 94.2% year-over-year rise.
Value investors will like QCOM, too. The stock earns a Value Grade of B thanks to a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 17.1 that's below the average of the S&P 500's large-cap stocks (22.6). Price-to-free cash flow (P/FCF) of 18.6 is below the industry average, as is a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 5.0.
Meanwhile, QCOM has an attractive 31% in potential upside based on analysts' average price target of $171.35 per share. Get Qualcomm's (QCOM) complete POWR Ratings analysis here.

Vertex Pharmaceuticals
Market value: $55.4 billion
POWR ratings: B (Buy)
Potential upside: 33%
Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX, $214.04) discovers and develops small-molecule drugs that treat serious diseases, with a specialization in cystic fibrosis. Its therapies are the global standard of care. VRTX's key cystic fibrosis drugs include Kalydeco, Orkambi, Symdeko and Trikafta.
The large-cap biotechnology stock also focuses on type 1 diabetes, influenza, inflammatory diseases, pain and other rare diseases.
VRTX's leading cystic fibrosis drugs, collectively, are approved to treat approximately half of the 80,000-plus people with cystic fibrosis in North America, Europe and Australia. Trikafta also has the potential to treat up to 90% of cystic fibrosis patients. The company's drugs should continue to dominate the market due to their disease-modifying potential, consistent use by patients, and not a lot of competition. The drugs also have very lengthy patents, which can protect against generics.
Vertex's non-cystic fibrosis pipeline is impressive as well. The company is exploring areas such as sickle cell disease, AAT deficiency and beta-thalassemia. VRTX also has been co-developing a gene-editing treatment with CRISPR Therapeutics (CRSP) targeting sickle cell disease and thalassemia. VRTX is actually buying the majority rights to this gene-editing therapy.
Vertex's stock has an overall grade of B, which is a Buy rating in Stock News' POWR Ratings system. Particularly attractive at the moment is its valuation, which receives a Value Grade of A. Chalk that up to a below-average forward P/E of 19.0, as well as a P/S of 8.8 and price-to-book (P/B) ratio of 6.2 that, while high in a vacuum, are well below industry averages.
Also attractive is a solid balance sheet. VRTX has a very high current ratio of 4.4, which suggests the company has more than enough liquidity to handle short-term needs.
And the ceiling is quite high compared to other large-cap stocks. Analysts have a consensus price target of $285.55 on the stock, implying more than 33% returns over the next 12 months. Get Vertex's (VRTX) complete POWR Ratings analysis here.

May 19 (Reuters) - Chipmaker Intel Corp's shareholders did not approve an executive compensation plan of its listed officers, according to a regulatory filing on Wednesday.
The decision, on a nonbinding advisory basis, was taken at the company's annual stockholder meeting on May 13. (https://bit.ly/3tWxAJe)
In a statement, Intel said it ""has a long-standing commitment to pay-for-performance, which holds executive officers accountable for business results and rewards them for consistently strong corporate performance and the creation of stockholder value ... The board also finds it incredibly important to ensure that it has a meaningful dialogue with our investors throughout the year so it can get their feedback on important matters affecting Intel.""
Intel shareholders also rejected a proposal for a report on median pay gaps across race and gender within the company.
In recent years, Intel has struggled with building new manufacturing technology, causing it to fall behind rivals Advanced Micro Devices Inc and Nvidia Corp in the race to make smaller chips with a faster processing speed.
Patrick Gelsinger, who returned to Intel as CEO this year, in March announced plans to expand its advanced chip manufacturing capacity and spend as much as $20 billion to build two factories in Arizona and open its factories to outside customers.

2021-05-19 00:00:00+00:00,Ampere announces custom computing cores as it courts cloud customers,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/ampere-announces-custom-computing-cores-as-it-courts-cloud-customers-2021-05-19,,,"By Stephen Nellis
May 19 (Reuters) - Ampere Computing Llc, founded by former Intel Corp INTC.O President Renee James, said on Wednesday it will release a processor next year featuring its own custom-designed computing cores, joining a small group of custom chip companies that includes Apple Inc AAPL.O.
The data-center chip startup is one of a number of companies aiming to challenge Intel and Advanced Micro Devices Inc AMD.O, which together own most of the booming market for data center and cloud computing chips. Ampere uses some underlying technology from Arm Ltd, the British provider of intellectual property that goes into most of the world's smartphone chips.
The computing core is the most critical part of any chip design, determining key attributes of the chip such has how much electricity it uses, how much computing power it has and how well it handles different types of software.
Ampere - along with companies like Marvell Technology Inc MRVL.O and Amazon.com Inc's AMZN.O Amazon Web Services - is using Arm's intellectual property to create chips that are far more power-efficient than those from Intel and AMD. But most of the chips Ampere competes against use off-the-shelf computing core designs provided by Arm.
Ampere, by contrast, has designed its own computing cores, which could set its chips apart from rivals. Perhaps the best known maker of Arm chips with custom computing cores is Apple, which uses custom cores to differentiate its phones from Android rivals. After years of perfecting its cores in phones, Apple tapped them for its M1 laptop and desktop chips last year to move away from Intel processors.
""It's very analogous to what Apple did with M1 - we're doing it for server,"" James told Reuters in an interview.
Ampere has been working on the custom cores since the company's founding in 2017. James, who spent nearly 30 years at Intel, noted that most of today's cloud chips are descended from Intel's processor designs from the 1990s. She said Ampere wanted to fully customize its chips from the cores up for the way that cloud vendors sell computing power to customers today.
""We're very focused on the future, not on the past,"" James said.
Oracle Corp ORCL.N, Microsoft Corp MSFT.O, China's Tencent Holdings Ltd 0700.HK and ByteDance, owner of the popular TikTok app, have committed to using the chips.
