2021-08-31 00:00:00+00:00,2 Reasons to Buy AMD Stock Over Intel,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/2-reasons-to-buy-amd-stock-over-intel-2021-08-31,,,"It isn't surprising that shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) have displayed terrific momentum over the past six months, especially when compared to chip giant Intel (NASDAQ: INTC). While Intel stock has lost ground, AMD stepped on the gas thanks to a bunch of solid catalysts that have ensured rapid growth in its revenue and earnings.
AMD data by YCharts
Intel, on the other hand, is experiencing some struggles in its key businesses. It won't be surprising to see AMD stock race higher and substantially outpace Intel on the market, as it enjoys a couple of distinct advantages over its bigger rival.
Intel doesn't have access to this huge market
Intel's non-GAAP revenue for the second quarter increased by just 2% year over year to $18.5 billion. That pales in comparison to AMD's impressive year-over-year revenue growth of 99% to $3.85 billion in Q2. This jump was driven by a surge in its enterprise, embedded, and semi-custom (EESC) business segment. That segment produced $1.6 billion in revenue last quarter, an increase of 183% over the prior year, driven by growth in sales of EPYC server processors and semi-custom chips used in gaming consoles.
It is worth noting that AMD's EESC revenue took off over the past year as the latest generation of gaming consoles from Microsoft and Sony went into production. The PlayStation 5 and the Microsoft Xbox Series X/S use its semi-custom chips, giving AMD access to a lucrative market that Intel is missing out on. Intel reportedly tried and failed to snatch the PS5 semi-custom slot away from AMD, and that's turning out to be a key differentiator between their financial performances.

AMD is going to enjoy this catalyst for a long time as the new console cycle is still in its initial stages. The PS5 recently became the fastest-selling PlayStation console with 10 million units sold. It hit that mark three weeks faster than the PlayStation 4. More importantly, the PS5 is expected to sell more than 200 million units in its lifetime, according to Rakuten Securities, far exceeding the PS4's lifetime sales of 116 million units.
In addition, AMD has another growth driver it can count on for its semi-custom business -- it will be supplying chips for the Steam Deck portable gaming PC, which could see it benefit from the lucrative handheld gaming console market. All told, AMD's EESC business is built for long-term growth thanks to the booming market for gaming consoles, as well as the market share gains it has achieved in the server processor space.
Chipzilla is arriving late to the graphics card party
Intel is making a foray into the multibillion-dollar discrete GPU (graphics processing unit) space: It recently revealed that it will be releasing its Arc-branded graphics cards in 2022's first quarter. Codenamed Alchemist, the first generation of Intel's discrete cards is expected to be based on a 7-nanometer manufacturing process. This seems promising for Intel, at least on paper.
NVIDIA and AMD's latest GPU architectures are also based on 7nm manufacturing processes. An identical manufacturing process means that Intel could match its rivals on the technological front and pack in some serious computing power. Third-party reports indicate that the new Intel GPUs could be pitted against mid-range cards from NVIDIA and AMD.
However, AMD is reportedly planning to make the jump to a 5nm manufacturing process next year. Its RDNA3 graphics cards are expected to deliver much more computing power than its current offerings, which could help it counter the incoming competition from Intel. We have already seen how AMD's technological advantages have helped it win market share away from Intel in the CPU (central processing unit) space. Given that Intel's offerings will be behind the manufacturing curve almost as soon as they arrive, its entry into the GPU market may not yield substantial gains either.

AMD held 20% of the discrete GPU market in the first quarter and NVIDIA controlled the rest, according to Jon Peddie Research. AMD can win big if it manages to hold on to its share of the market, as sales of discrete GPUs are expected to increase from $23.6 billion in 2020 to $54 billion in 2025. As Intel is late to this party and its rivals have a firm grip on the discrete GPU market, it remains to be seen if Chipzilla can make its presence felt in this space.
Moreover, given that Intel is losing market share and pricing power in personal computer CPUs and data center chips, it isn't surprising that analysts are lukewarm about its prospects. Its earnings are expected to increase at an annualized rate of 10% through the next five years, while AMD is expected to clock annualized earnings growth of nearly 33% over the same period. As such, investors looking to buy a growth stock in the semiconductor space have solid reasons to skip Intel and go with AMD.

Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) stock tends to move significantly over longer time periods. I believe there’s a big opportunity in purchasing Intel’s shares, but it probably isn’t imperative that investors rush out and do so today. 
Source: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com
The once-dominant chipmaker is currently facing multiple, formidable foes with considerable power, but it does seem to be headed in the right direction again. Also, it’s certainly inexpensive now. 
Intel will be worth more in the coming years but the company’s size and task it faces mean it won’t rise overnight. Still, if you’re willing to be patient, this turnaround is one worth betting on.
Intel’s July 26 earnings left investors feeling indifferent, which was a bit of a surprise. After all, the company ended up exceeding expectations on multiple fronts. It exceeded Q2 guidance for revenue, earnings per share and gross margin. 
Further, Intel’s PC and MobilEye businesses recorded record revenue in the quarter. These successes led the company to bullishly raise full-year guidance for both revenue and EPS by both GAAP and non-GAAP measurements.

The 7 Best Stocks to Buy for September
Yet, when the news was released, INTC stock traded just as it might on any normal day. Investor indifference could have been a result of simply wanting more. Revenues, while exceeding expectations by $700 million, were only up 2%. 
Investors are struggling to see a clear investment thesis for semiconductor manufacturers as the current shortage introduces a host of unknowns, increasing volatility.
Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger was upbeat, noting that his firm’s scale and momentum should make it a winner in the upcoming decade. He sees sustained growth for that time horizon as the digitization of everything necessitates greater chip volume production. 
A Closer Look at INTC Stock
It’s no secret that Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) is a massively important force in chip manufacturing. Taiwan, along with South Korea and Samsung dominate the foundry space, leaving U.S. manufacturers beholden to those firms in a geopolitical tug-of-war. 
Firms like Intel are scrambling to bring foundries stateside and abroad under their control precisely because of that geopolitical risk.
Rumors of a potential acquisition surfaced in July between Intel and GlobalFoundries. However, GlobalFoundries looks to be going public as the company recently filed its intention to proceed with an IPO.
Had the deal materialized, Intel would have increased its foundry footprint, moving more toward a Samsung and Taiwan Semiconductor business model.
That acquisition would have carried some irony as GlobalFoundries was created as a result of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) spinning off its production capabilities. 
U.S. Foundries
While that deal looks to be dead in the water, Intel’s intent is clear: It is headed toward a future in which it becomes a hybrid supplier rather than an outright competitor in semiconductors. 
Undoubtedly, a GlobalFoundries acquisition would have been a boon to INTC stock, but the company will continue that search. 
The process is a long one, and Intel is already advancing its fabrication efforts in the U.S. 
Back in March Intel announced that it was investing $20 billion into new fabrication facilities at the company’s Arizona campus. 
That means that Intel’s internal capabilities will be getting a boost. The company will be more able to meet its own needs in the coming years.
It also signals a return of Intel to the business of making semiconductors designed by other companies. 
It’s clear that Intel believes its future will include renewed efforts toward establishing a name for itself as a foundry. Back in 2013-2014 Intel attempted and failed to begin a foundry. This time the company is making its foundry a stand-alone effort to be run by its senior vice president, Randhir Thakur. 
The Bottom Line
Intel is turning around after a tumultuous few years. If its foundry plans succeed this time, money invested now should be worth much more in a few years. That’s the investment thesis bulls should understand if they are to establish a position in Intel now. 
It won’t happen overnight, but once the signs that the strategy is working appear, gains will be had quickly.

Some folks might be hesitant to own shares of Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) because of the global chip shortage. Others may choose to avoid INTC stock because the technology sector seems grossly overpriced.

Those concerns are perfectly understandable. However, I invite you to consider taking a “This, too, shall pass” attitude towards the semiconductor supply issue.
And regarding the high valuation of the tech sector, this doesn’t necessarily apply to all stocks. As we’ll see, INTC stock is trading at a surprisingly low multiple.
Besides, there are recent developments at Intel – including a change of leadership – that indicate progress, and a potential share-price comeback.
A Closer Look at INTC Stock
By “share-price comeback,” I’m referring to the hope of a rebound as INTC stock has pulled back sharply since April.

7 Best ETFs to Buy to Cover a Broad Spectrum of Opportunities
To be more specific, the stock topped out on April 9, at a 52-week high of $68.49. A drawdown was probably inevitable, after a powerful rally during 2021’s first quarter.
Traders who chased after INTC stock near the top, were soon punished. By late August, the stock had declined all the way to $53 and change.
Momentum-focused traders might balk at the idea of buying a stock in a downtrend. On the other hand, value-oriented investors might look at the situation differently.
Currently, Intel’s trailing 12-month price-to-earnings ratio is 11.95. This indicates a real bargain – something that’s hard to find in today’s technology segment.
To quote InvestorPlace contributor Dana Blankenhorn, “The former chip industry leader is now cheap as chips.”
On top of that, Intel pays out a forward annual dividend yield of 2.58%.
Therefore, income seekers can add INTC stock to their portfolios and leverage the magic of compounding to grow their accounts over time.
Changing of the Guard
New leadership can bring new life to a struggling company. This seems to be the case with Intel, which had a CEO change-over earlier this year.
With typical directness, Blankenhorn described how Intel’s previous CEO, Brian Krzanich, “turned out to be one of the worst CEOs of the last decade.”
(It should be noted that Bob Swan briefly served as the CEO of Intel from January 2019 to February 2021.)
Under Krzanich, Intel failed to compete in manufacturing – and shamefully, Krzanich was ousted after a sex scandal.
With that, Intel had to install a new CEO, right before the onset of a semiconductor supply shortage. Could the company dig itself out of this situation?
Thankfully, new CEO Pat Geisinger brings 30 years of prior experience at Intel – and optimism that the company can start a whole new chapter.
According to Intel, Geisinger “was the architect of the original 80486 processor, led 14 different microprocessor programs and played key roles in the Core and Xeon families.”
So Far, So Good
Since Geisinger was installed as CEO in February, he certainly can’t take all of the credit for Intel’s excellent second-quarter 2021 financial results.
During that quarter, Intel exceeded its second-quarter guidance for revenues, earnings per share, and gross margin.
Moreover, the company posted record second-quarter revenues for its PC and Mobileye segments.
In addition, Intel raised its full-year 2021 guidance to GAAP revenues of $77.6 billion as well as  GAAP earnings per share of $4.09.
And more recently, Intel just picked up a major new client.
Reportedly, the U.S. Department of Defense, through the NSTXL consortium-based S2MARTS OTA, contracted Intel to provide commercial foundry services.
This work will be led by Intel Foundry Services, the company’s dedicated foundry business which was launched this year.
The Bottom Line
Blankenhorn’s assessment of Krzanich is harsh, but justified. Intel needed to make a change in its leadership.
So far, the company seems to have picked a winner in Geisinger. This should help Intel’s investors feel more optimistic.
Besides, INTC stock should appeal to value hunters with its low P/E ratio, as well as income seekers with its generous dividend payouts.

A lot is made of the rise of the big tech stocks. There are always plenty of “If you bought $1,000 of [fill in the blank] 10 years ago…” out there these days. But Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock usually isn’t one of those.
Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com
That’s good for us.
Perhaps zero-to-hero stuff is the grease that keeps the wheels of FOMO investing going. Or maybe it’s the accelerant that get new investors excited about rolling the dice in the market.
Nvidia is up more than 225% in the past three years. And since its IPO in 1999, NVDA stock is up nearly 51,000%.
What those stats don’t reveal is how Nvidia just kept doing what it was good at and ended up one of the premier chipmaking stocks of the 21st century.
NVDA Stock: King of the GPU
Before our current era of mobility, way back for Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) was a thing and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) was trading around $40 a share, before its second of five stock splits.
NVDA stock had its IPO in January 1999, and the first of its five stock splits was in June 2000. Both stock split the same month and year, in the beginning of the dot-com bust. But they have certainly more than endured since then.
7 Best ETFs to Buy to Cover a Broad Spectrum of Opportunities
While AAPL was focused on the consumer, NVDA was focused on the chips inside the box.
Its initial audience research and development divisions in companies, governments and educational institutions. These were the people that were willing to spend big money to buy top-quality graphics processing units (GPUs). There was also a budding gaming community that was stepping up their interest in better performance.
And that was what kept NVDA stock moving was the rise of computers – desktops and laptops at the time – and the growing versatility of computers and programs.
Rise of the Internet
The next big growth boost for NVDA stock was the rise of the internet after the dot-com bust. Much of the optimism that fueled the runup to the bust was tangible, but the technology wasn’t there to realize all the potential at the time.
But after those crazy days the real companies with real businesses that were left set about making all those hopes realities. Fiberoptic cable and the surrounding technologies meant much faster internet speeds. It also started telecoms down the mobility road.
This took computing out of the workplace and home and into the streets. And devices continued to get smaller and more powerful simultaneously.
NVDA stock was still making GPUs, but it now had more and more markets where it could participate.
Today and Tomorrow
It was less than a decade ago when NVDA stock really started to come into its own. By now mobility wasn’t just limited to mobile phones, it was about cloud computing, faster, more powerful telecom networks and massive data farms and big data.
All these new opportunities were demanding better quality, more powerful GPUs because data visualization becomes crucial when the quantity of your data is enormous. Because to manage it, you have to see it.
Also, virtual reality and augmented reality became possible with all this computing power. Yet they needed high-end GPUs to power them.
As smart devices began to show up, they needed fast, reliable GPUs as well. Autonomous vehicles, smart cars, artificial intelligence, robots, machine learning, you name it and Nvidia GPUs are there.
And the crazy thing was, no one really challenged NVDA stock in the higher-end markets until recently. But even now, it ends up partnering with big players like Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) rather than competing against them.
AMD and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) can keep their GPUs but few try to knock off NVDA stock’s high-end chips. As a matter of fact, NVDA is now going after the legacy chipmakers rather than the other way around.
A True Growth Stock
NVDA stock is one of the best choices for anyone bullish on an increasingly tech-driven world. It’s so deeply embedded in the core of the tech sector that it will continue to grow for years to come.
Right now, we’re in the middle of a big chip shortage. And that’s great for NVDA stock. It’s up 73% year to date and 72% in the past 52 weeks. This bull run has plenty of legs left.
Your best bet is to buy in over time. Take an initial position and then get in a bit at a time.

2021-08-29 00:00:00+00:00,"Got $1,000? Buy These 3 Top Tech Stocks After Earnings",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/got-%241000-buy-these-3-top-tech-stocks-after-earnings-2021-08-29,,,"Second-quarter calendar year 2021 earnings season is mostly now in the books, and technology companies around the globe continue to be the engine of the economy. Revenue and profits are growing near record paces and showing little sign of slowing anytime soon. Lots of investment returns can still be had for those with a long-term mindset.
If you're looking for a place to invest some spare cash right now, three Fool contributors think Western Digital (NASDAQ: WDC), Aspen Technology (NASDAQ: AZPN), and Alibaba Group Holding (NYSE: BABA) are worth a look right now. Here's why.
This storage giant is cheap and in talks for a transformative merger
Billy Duberstein (Western Digital): Shares of storage player Western Digital are down about 20% from recent highs, and nearly 50% from all-time highs set back in early 2018. That was before the onset of the U.S.-China trade war caused a memory and storage pricing crash, from which Western Digital has never recovered. Western Digital even cut its dividend in May 2020, during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, and just when new CEO David Goeckeler came on the job, giving the company a fresh start.
Yet coming out of the pandemic, Western Digital has been doing pretty well under Goeckeler. Last quarter, revenue rose 14% to $4.9 billion, and adjusted earnings per share rose to $2.16, beating expectations by a rather sizable $0.66. Management also guided for sequential growth, to between $4.9 billion and $5.1 billion in revenue and adjusted EPS of $2.25 to $2.55. The digitization of the economy is spurring strong demand across Western Digital's hard disk and NAND flash products, with each segment seeing revenue growth and gross margin expansion last quarter.
Based on those solid results, Western Digital trades at just over six times average forward earnings estimates, and only five times the most optimistic analyst forecast. Of course, the stock is this cheap because its business has traditionally been extremely cyclical, especially the NAND segment, resulting in losses when a downcycle hits the industry.
But there could be good news coming in the NAND world. The Wall Street Journal recently reported that Western Digital was in advanced talks to merge with privately held Kioxia, another large player in the NAND and HDD businesses. Western Digital already has a strategic partnership with Kioxia, so merging would make a lot of sense.
Should the merger go through -- still a big if, as regulatory hurdles remain in both Japan and China -- the NAND industry will consolidate from six players last year to just four main players, following SK Hynix's acquisition of Intel's NAND business, which was agreed to last fall.
The more consolidated DRAM and HDD industries have been able to maintain higher profitability through cycles than the NAND players, due to larger scale and less competition. Should the NAND business go down to just four players outside China, it could lead to structurally higher profits going forward. Western Digital's stock seems cheap enough to buy even without that scenario, but the stock could go much higher should the merger happen.

Here's a direct bet on stronger industrial operating budgets
Anders Bylund (Aspen Technology): Industrial asset optimization may not sound like much of a party, but Aspen Technology is making that market look downright exciting.
AspenTech's software helps its customers produce fuels, engineered materials, and chemicals more efficiently. These tools are difficult to replace once your company has gotten used to tweaking its production processes with AspenTech's tools. These tools are based on AspenTech's 40 years of engineering analytics experience and boosted by a powerful hub of artificial intelligence and Internet of Things assets.
Two weeks ago, in the most recent earnings call, AspenTech CEO Antonio Pietri highlighted how one Japanese client reduced carbon dioxide emissions by 160,000 metric tons per year thanks to a successful supply chain analysis. In another example, a global mining giant signed an AspenTech contract worth $3 million a year to boost the safety and sustainability of this customer's operations.
Customer interest in AspenTech's software is high, but lowered software budgets during the coronavirus panic of 2020 have limited the purchasing plans of many IT directors.
""We're confident this is a temporary phenomenon and that as the operating conditions require it, customers will begin to budget for operations and maintenance spending that will support increased growth in the future,"" Pietri said. ""Our baseline assumption is that spending conditions improve in the second half of the fiscal year as customers set their calendar 2022 budgets in the context of greater certainty and a better operating and macro environment than they did last year.""
The stock is trading roughly 20% below 52-week highs, hamstrung by mixed results in that recent earnings report. I think that drop opened up an inviting buy-in window for AspenTech's stock.
You can think of AspenTech as a bet on artificial intelligence or as a coronavirus rebound opportunity, or you might simply appreciate the company's rare combination of ultra-loyal customers and 45% bottom-line profit margins. Any way you slice it, AspenTech looks like a solid buy today.
A wall of regulatory changes won't stop Alibaba long-term
Nicholas Rossolillo (Alibaba): China's e-commerce giant Alibaba had a fantastic showing in its fiscal 2022 first quarter (the three months ended in June 2021). Excluding its acquisition of a leading supermarket chain, revenue increased 22% year over year to $29 billion, building on the massive surge in online spending from the same period last year during China's pandemic lockdowns. Adjusted net income increased 10% to $6.72 billion.
Now that we have the numbers out of the way, let's address the massive elephant in the room: China's renewed zeal for regulating its tech industry. Compounding on top of ongoing geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and China, Chinese regulation crackdowns on Alibaba as well as internal scandals have sent the tech behemoth from a market cap high of over $840 billion last October to just $450 billion as of this writing. Shares trade for 20 times trailing-12-month earnings per share (or 14 times trailing-12-month free cash flow), which would otherwise be a steal of a deal given Alibaba's enduring growth story.
I struggle to see why the regulatory risks that need to be accepted with Alibaba differ so much from the regulatory risks with U.S.-based big tech. Sure, when viewed through our lens here in the states, the Chinese Communist Party's crackdown on tech is a perennial problem -- one that has sent companies like Alibaba and its Chinese tech titan peers like Tencent Holdings and JD.com reeling on more than one occasion.
But this is a dynamic longtime investors in U.S. tech have had to grow accustomed to as well (numerous lawsuits, fines, and calls for antitrust action against Facebook and Alphabet's Google anyone?). While the ruling party in China may have fewer checks on it than here in the states, political powers around the globe are trying to reel in the economic power technology companies wield. It's part of the game, no matter which country you invest in.
I'm not saying Alibaba stock is devoid of risk. There are reasons you might give serious pause before plopping some money down here. Tread lightly, and stay diversified. However, after getting absolutely clobbered, I think the risks are well priced in -- and Alibaba will continue to grow as China continues to develop its economy for the 21st century. For those with the appetite for some extreme volatility, the stock looks like a pretty good long-term buy to me right now.

2021-08-27 00:00:00+00:00,"Western Digital $20 billion all-stock offer for Kioxia poses valuation, cash challenge - analysts",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/western-digital-%2420-billion-all-stock-offer-for-kioxia-poses-valuation-cash-challenge,,,"By Chavi Mehta
Aug 27 (Reuters) - A possible merger between storage hardware maker Western Digital Corp WDC.O with its Japanese partner and chipmaker Kioxia Holdings could create a NAND memory chipmaking giant that rivals Samsung Electronics 005930.KS.
But analysts are questioning whether Kioxia's investors will accept the price and terms of the reported $20 billion all-stock offer from Western Digital, which would provide no cash to the Japanese firm and put a lower value on it than other comparable deals in the industry. Western Digital on Friday filed documents to issue more shares but did not disclose the size of the offering.
Kioxia is one the largest players in NAND memory chips that provide the storage space in phones and hard drives, competing with South Korea's Samsung and SK Hynix. Hynix last year agreed to buy U.S. chipmaker Intel Corp's INTC.O NAND business for $9 billion.
Analysts said the Intel deal provides a sense of what buyers are willing to pay for memory companies. Summit Insights Group analyst Kinngai Chan said that Kioxia has about three times the sales of Intel's memory unit, so Kioxia's owners may want about three times the price - $25 billion to $28 billion.
But Western Digital's entire market valuation is lower than Chan's estimated price tag for Kioxia at about $20 billion as of its close Aug. 25 when the media reports on the deal came out. In a note to investors, UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri said even at a $20 billion price tag for Kioxia, the Japanese firm's huge price relative to Western Digital's overall value makes it ""hard to see WDC wanting to issue that much stock at this valuation.""
Analysts instead said that investors in Kioxia, which was sold by Toshiba Corp 6502.T in 2018 to a consortium led by private equity firm Bain Capital for $18 billion as Toshiba Memory Corp, would prefer an all-cash deal or at least a deal with a heavy cash component. But some analysts believe Kioxia's owners could come around to an all-stock deal if they believe the combined company's shares will rise in the coming years.
""It could be a long-term play on the combined company's success,"" said William Kerwin, analyst at Morningstar Research. ""Or it may have been the only way to offload Kioxia at a valuation they wanted.""

While autonomous vehicle (AV) stocks remain one of the most exciting tech industries in thestock market today it is also one that may require time to grow. The AV space may be relatively young now, but many companies are already showing interest and taking action to have a piece of the pie. These would include some of the tech giants such as Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) that has a company dedicated to autonomous driving, Mobileye. Well, it is not surprising given that the industry is projected to be a multibillion-dollar industry in the not-so-distant future.  
Also, it appears that there will be another player in the industry soon. Xiaomi Corp (OTCKMKTS: XIACF) recently announced that it will buy AV tech startup Deepmotion for about $77.4 million. This announcement comes after the company reported a better-than-expected financial result for its second quarter. Some may be unaware that the company has now taken top spots in the smartphone industry in many countries. So, the fact that it is showing interest in the AV space is very intriguing, to say the least. With all that being said, do you have this list of autonomous vehicle stocks to buy in the stock market right now?

It expanded its presence in California by opening new operations facilities, hiring more engineers, and adding a new office. So far, Motional already tests its AVs in Boston, Las Vegas, Pittsburgh, and even Singapore. These tests are a small but important step in the right direction for the company to prove the reliability of its self-driving technology.  
Also, Aptiv announced its second-quarter earnings result earlier this month. The company posted GAAP revenue of $3.8 billion, representing an increase of 94% year-over-year. Furthermore, it posted a GAAP net income of $147 million compared to a net loss of $369 million in the prior year’s period. The company’s strong start to the year is a testament to its portfolio of market-relevant technologies aligned to the safe and connected megatrends. Given all these, would you add APTV stock to your watchlist?

Baidu Inc 
Following that, we will be looking at Chinese tech giant Baidu. The company is known for its search platform, Baidu.com. Much like Google search, you could find information online, including Webpages, news, images, and many more. Recently, Baidu has been pushing forward with its Intelligent Driving and AV solutions.  
Last week, the company held its annual flagship tech conference, Baidu World 2021. Baidu showed how its latest innovations will transform and improve transportation, industry, and our daily lives. The company CEO Robin Li unveiled his vision for mobility through “robocars”. He believes that cars of the future will drive autonomously and act as both an intelligent assistant and loyal companion while having the ability to self-learn. These visions may seem a little far-fetched at this point but we also know that it is possible given how fast technology is advancing. 
Not only that, but Li also spoke about the shift to the AV driving 2.0 era, which is marked by a transition from the technical verification stage to large-scale commercial operations. He announced a new Luobo Kuaipao robotaxi mobile platform that aims to commercialize autonomous driving. Hence, hailed AV will be more accessible to the broader public. With all these exciting developments in the AV space, would you consider BIDU stock as a top AV stock to watch?

Alphabet Inc 
Next, we have the global tech giant, Alphabet Inc. Most would be familiar with the company’s products including Google Search, Gmail, YouTube, and Google Cloud. But what some may not be aware of is, Alphabet also has a self-driving car project that was started more than a decade ago with the goal of driving autonomously. Today, the project has turned into Waymo. 
This week, Waymo announced that it will start offering autonomous rides to the public in San Francisco. Actually, this service was already available to its employees in its earlier versions of the commercial program. However, people who are now interested can apply through the Waymo One app to take part in the “Trusted Tester” program to get free rides. In exchange, users will have to give feedback that would help to improve the company’s AV experience.  
While it may be completely autonomous, there will still be a human safety driver at the front seat. So, if you’re in the area and want to give it a go, you shouldn’t be worried. After all, Waymo does have approximately 300 vehicles running in Phoenix. And some of which operate without a safety driver. With all said and done, if Waymo successfully coasts its way throughout the narrow streets of San Francisco, it would be a huge success for the company. Hence, would you bet on the future of GOOGL stock in the AV industry?

Luminar Technologies Inc 
To sum it up, we have the AV and lidar technology company, Luminar. Essentially, the company specializes in long-range lidar products for autonomous driving. It now has two segments, Autonomy Solutions, and Other Component Sales. While LAZR stock has risen over 50% over the past year, it has been facing some turbulence in the stock market this year. That said, some may consider this as an attractive opportunity. 
Earlier this month, the company announced one of its most impressive quarters yet. Luminar announced revenue of $6.3 million, up by 84% year-over-year and an increase of 19% compared to the prior quarter. Thus, this has allowed the company to raise its full-year 2021 revenue guidance to $30 to $33 million. The company has been relentlessly executing and beating each of its goals set this year.  
Luminar is certainly not resting on its laurels. Last Friday, it announced the addition of four industry leaders to fuel its push to its next phase of growth and execution. These additions will bring a combined century of professional experience in the automotive and tech industry. One of the notable appointments would be Sardar Gautham who will be the Vice President of Business Operations and Alignment. He previously served as head of hardware strategy and execution at Waymo. All things considered, would you consider buying LAZR stock on the dip?

2021-08-27 00:00:00+00:00,"Earn $1,000 in Monthly Retirement Dividends With 3 Simple Steps",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/earn-%241000-in-monthly-retirement-dividends-with-3-simple-steps-2021-08-27,,,"If you're like most investors, your ultimate goal is building a nice retirement nest egg, or at least improving the financial circumstances of the retirement you've already begun. We all just want enough cash to cover all our bills and all our fun dreams during our golden years.
The thing is, pensions and Social Security probably won't cut it for most people. The average retiree's monthly Social Security check in 2020 was a modest $1,544. And while some pensions are still being paid to remaining plan participants, most companies have punted retirement savings duties to workers themselves.
If you're looking for a comfortable retirement, you're mostly going to have to make it happen for yourself. That means living off dividend income in retirement, which in turn means growing a nest egg large enough to buy enough dividend stocks later in life. An extra $1,000 a month would make a big difference for a lot of retirees.
With that being said, here's a rough three-step plan on how to reach that goal. Logistically, each step is simple enough. The challenge lies in persistently maintaining our focus over many years
1. Invest in reliable growth stocks for 30 years or so
There are plenty of growth stocks to choose from. But not all of them are reliable growth stocks. Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) is a reliable growth name, for instance, dominating the search engine market, and is likely to continue doing so for the indefinite future. Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) is another growth name, but not one that's reliable enough to hang on to for the long haul. Years of R&D missteps are now haunting the company, and by extension, haunting shareholders. As a result, the stock is trading where it was as of early 2018, upsetting anyone with a big stake in Intel who was planning three years ago to retire in 2021.

There's a specific target to aim for, too. It requires around $600,000 upon retirement to generate $12,000 worth of dividend income per year at the market's current dividend yields. Assuming you start seriously investing in your mid-30's and achieve the average annual market return of around 10%, compounding the returns on a contribution of $300 per month would get you past the $600,000 mark after three decades. Start saving later in life, and your monthly contribution figure will be considerably different.
You could also build a nice nest egg using lower-returning value stocks, or dividend stocks, or a mix of all three. Recent history suggests that this lower-return path would require much bigger monthly contributions to reach the $600,000 mark, though, while smaller monthly contributions could get you there if you're able to find and stick with the very best growth picks.
^SPXG data by YCharts.
2. Start transitioning from growth to dividend stocks well before your retirement date
Growth names like Alphabet (or even Intel) might be appropriate picks when you're younger and working, and have time to wait out any temporary pullbacks. Retirees in need of income right now don't always have the luxury of holding out for better days, though.
In fact, smart investors begin transitioning away from riskier, growth-oriented picks and into safer dividend payers well before they actually call it quits at work. This affords them an opportunity to get out of overvalued growth names on their own terms rather than the market's terms. Likewise, this early migration gives investors a chance to scoop up dividend-paying stocks while they're cheap, even if those investors don't actually need the income just yet.
Just bear in mind this shift doesn't all have to happen at the same time, or even in the same year. It should be a process rather than an event.
3. Unless things change, commit at least $600,000 to dividend-paying stocks by the time you retire
Finally, the $600,000 figure mentioned above isn't a number randomly pulled out of a hat. It's the amount you'll need to generate $1,000 worth of monthly dividend income using today's prevailing dividend yields; an average yield of 2% on $600,000 worth of dividend stocks works out to $12,000 in dividends per year.
Alert investors might immediately recognize the S&P 500's current yield is a much-lower 1.3%. Just keep in mind that a bunch of companies that don't pay a dividend (or don't care much about paying one) are weighing the average down. For instance, the S&P 500 High Dividend Index only includes the S&P 500's 80 highest-yielding names, and it's currently yielding 4%. Anyone seeking out good dividend growth and the healthy chance for a little capital appreciation may find they like the stocks somewhere in the middle of that continuum, where reliable yields of around 2% are readily attainable.
The good news is, interest rates (and therefore dividend yields) might be on the verge of prolonged increases. If they trek higher for some time, it's possible you'd only need $500,000 to drive $1,000 worth of monthly dividend checks. An average dividend yield of only 2.4% would do the trick.
The bad news is, it could be years before yields from well-balanced companies could get back to that mark, last seen in the 1990s, if they ever get back there at all.
Continually updating any plan is the key
This is only a rough outline. Investors with less time to save will want to save more, while anyone due a pension as well as a Social Security check may not need another $1,000 per month. Yields change, too. Your retirement savings plan should be reviewed every year, and updated as needed.
If you're just now starting to put a bigger-picture investment plan together, this rough outline gives you plenty to consider, and prompts plenty of questions to ask. Even answering just a few of them now is better than doing nothing and hoping for the best.

I have always had mixed feelings about Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD). In April 2020, I said the pandemic sell-off created “the best opportunity investors are going to have to get into AMD stock.” But even then, I was only lukewarm on AMD.

Since that time, AMD stock is up another 1,310%. Most of the reasons I liked the stock at the time are still valid. Most of the reasons I was skeptical of its valuation are too.

7 of the Best Dividend Stocks to Buy for September
If you’re buying AMD stock today, there are plenty of things to like about its long-term outlook. There are also a lot of risks.
AMD Stock Pros
AMD stock gives investors exposure to some of the biggest long-term growth markets in the tech sector. Under the leadership of CEO Lisa Su, AMD has somehow gained a technological edge over its competitors, most notably Intel (NASDAQ:INTC).
AMD recently reported its seventh-straight quarter of double-digit revenue growth. Its PC, server and gaming businesses are booming. AMD chips are in the latest generation of both PlayStation and Xbox gaming consoles. AMD GPUs help power Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) electric vehicles.
The company recently raised its 2021 full-year revenue growth guidance to 60% from 50%. Business is booming.
Even after the big run by AMD stock, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) analyst Vivek Arya says there is more upside ahead. Arya is projecting AMD will capture about 20% share of the $66 billion PC and Server microprocessor market by 2023. That market share expansion could boost AMD’s earnings per share to the $5 range.
“We estimate that AMD has claimed ~60% of the incremental sales growth in PC + Server MPU over the last three years, an acceleration from the 40% incremental share in the trailing 5-yr period. AMD is exposed to attractive, duopolistic compute markets with limited exposure to more cyclical smartphone, memory, autos/industrial demand,” Arya recently told clients.
In addition, it doesn’t seem Intel is in a position to stop AMD anytime soon. AMD is on track to launch its 5-nanometer Genoa chips sometime in mid-2022. Intel is expected to launch its 7-nanometer Sapphire Rapids chips at around the same time. In other words, AMD is on track to remain one generation ahead.
BofA’s Arya has a “buy” rating and $135 price target for AMD stock.
AMD Stock Cons
At this point, I believe the AMD stock valuation is by far the biggest risk to owning the stock. AMD bull Arya is projecting $3.24 in 2022 EPS. That projection means AMD stock is already trading at more than 32 times bullish 2022 earnings estimates. Where’s the upside?
AMD stock trades at 9.4x sales, 50.9x free cash flow and 18.5x book value. Those numbers aren’t necessarily through the roof, but they certainly don’t suggest significant additional upside.
Meanwhile, there’s an 800-pound gorilla in the room that may be standing between AMD and Arya’s long-term target of $5 per share earnings. I think it’s fair to say that gaining back its technology edge is priority number one for Intel.
Intel is likely pouring all available resources into reclaiming its throne as the chip leader. Sure, that money and scale hasn’t done them much good in recent years. But Intel generated a whopping $20.9 billion in net income in 2020 compared to just $2.5 billion for AMD.
Investors should never write off that large of a resource advantage. Intel will be coming hard for AMD in the next couple of years. Just one slip-up by AMD or one breakthrough by Intel could completely derail the long-term AMD growth story.
How To Play It
In recent weeks, AMD stock has taken over as one of the most popular social media meme stocks. I think it’s completely unfair that such an impressive growth company is lumped in with meme stocks like AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC), GameStop (NYSE:GME) and other high-debt businesses in secular decline.
Still, if you’re looking to buy and hold a meme stock for the long-term, AMD is one of the best. I’m not thrilled with the current valuation. But investors should feel good about buying the stock on any major dips. Just make sure to keep a eye on what Intel is up to.

Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) stock is up 18% so far in 2021. If anything, AMD stock is now cheaper than it was before.

Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com
That’s because AMD continues to grow rapidly on both the top and bottom lines. Advanced Micro Devices saw $710 million of net income in its second quarter, or 58 cents per share, on revenue of $3.85 billion. Additionally, revenue was nearly double that of the previous year.
For investors, it was a case of selling the news after buying the rumor. Over the last five years, AMD is up over 1,300%. In 2015, the year after Lisa Su became CEO of AMD, you could have gotten this stock for around $2 per share. The stock opened on Aug. 26 at about $108, with a market capitalization of around $131 billion.
Advanced Micro Devices Has Leverage
Since Su became CEO, AMD has had market leverage because it’s a chip designer, not a fabricator. Hardware has become software and software can carry enormous margins.

AMD has also benefitted from continuing weakness at Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), its long-time rival in PC chips. For example, the company’s Ryzen processors now run faster than Intel’s designs. AMD also has a graphics card line called Radeon. That line trails Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) in performance, but with the ongoing chip shortage, AMD can still get its price.
Now, the fear is that Nvidia is becoming the big brother to AMD (a position that Intel once held), especially as it moves to compete in general processors by buying Arm Holdings from Softbank (OTCMKTS:SFTBY). NVDA investors have done twice as well as those who invested in AMD over the last year. Nvidia also carries a higher price-earnings (P/E) ratio than AMD.
Why Is AMD Cheap?
AMD and Intel were founded within a year of each other, in 1968 and 1969. For over 40 years, AMD was the proverbial little brother, doomed to trail its larger rival. Now this has changed. AMD notebook chips now outsell those of Intel. The company is expanding its lead with 3-D chips as well.
Advanced Micro Devices is expected to be the second-largest customer of Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM) next year, trailing only Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Plus, TSM expects to make next-generation chips with circuit lines three nanometers (nm) apart next year — tech that AMD will get a lot of.
The company is also making its first big acquisition in years, agreeing to buy Xilinx (NASDAQ:XLNX) — a maker of programmable logic devices — for $35 billion. CEO Lisa Su expects that deal to close by the end of 2021.
Despite all of these pluses, though, there are several reasons why AMD stock remains cheap. Some long-time investors are taking profits. What’s more, the chip shortage is expected to ease in future years. Plus, Intel is making big noises about a comeback.
AMD has also used the shortage to prioritize higher-margin products, like notebook chips. Now, the fear is it may be unable to replicate current margins. During Q2, about 18% of AMD’s revenue hit the net income line.
And, while it’s cheaper than Nvidia, AMD is still not that cheap. Currently, it’s selling for 8.42 times forward revenue according to Seeking Alpha. Its forward P/E ratio of 43.49 is also nearly four times higher than Intel’s multiple.
The Bottom Line on AMD Stock
That all said, TV analyst Jim Cramer is telling viewers to ignore the worriers and buy AMD stock. I agree.
If you’re fearful of AMD’s current price, you can get in for less by buying Xilinx.  The regulatory hurdles here are much lower than with Nvidia’s purchase of Arm.
With chips going into everyday products, it’s hard to go wrong in the semiconductor space right now. Even if Intel gets its act together — and I think it will — there remains plenty of demand to go around.
Advanced Micro Devices has assured itself supplies for some leading-edge design in 2022. Given Nvidia’s valuation, buying AMD for some 10 times revenue is a bargain. So, if you’re just starting to buy semiconductor stocks and want faster profits, this is definitely a name you can buy.

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.

Today’s note may come across as bearish toward Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). In reality it is not, because my only concern is with the shorter-term price action. The company is on rails, and so is NVDA stock. But it doesn’t trade in a vacuum, so we have to consider the big picture.

At these altitudes, it is vulnerable to sharp drops, and those could come from extrinsic reasons. With that in mind, let’s move on to evaluating what is going right now. Let’s also take a look at what could be better for NVDA moving forward.
Nvidia has been in a breakout since April from around $155 per share. Along the way it really took flight mid May when it rallied 50% in 50 days. NVDA stock recently broke out again. This time from $206 per share.
Committing new longs for an investment from here is less than obvious. Those who are in it for the momentum trade are fine. I only worry about investors looking to initiate new, sizable positions.
At the risk of sounding repetitive and somewhat bearish, I would wait it out a few days. This is an incredible company, but I still would rather find proper entry points. Traditionally, long-term investors say that they don’t try to time the market. If that’s true, then waiting it out is just as logical as jumping in. Why not err on the side of caution with Nvidia stock?

7 of the Best Dividend Stocks to Buy for September
The macroeconomic conditions are unique. Wall Street has never gone through these circumstances before. We’ve rallied so long that the mathematical downside potential is much larger than the upside opportunity. One hiccup can turn into a serious crash. I am confident that we will have better entry points than up here. Missing out on a few upside bucks is a small price to pay for caution.
NVDA Stock Is Up for Some Good Reasons
Source: Charts by TradingView
Now that the ugly part is out of the way, let’s talk about the good points. This company is firing on all cylinders and setting trends. It is one of three major chip suppliers and it’s reigning supreme. This year, NVDA stock is up three times more than Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD). Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is miles behind — that’s a whole other story.
This week, we learned that NVDA and AMD chips could wiggle their way into government super-computer applications. The reason? INTC is literally late delivering its offering.
However, from a fundamental perspective, the stock is expensive. The premium is not crazy, since investors are getting the growth they seek. Besides I don’t need it to be cheap at this stage, so that’s not the concern. But when I compare it to AMD, I see dislocations.
Since 2018, NVDA almost doubled its revenues and grew the net income 75%. Meanwhile, AMD more than doubled revenues and grew net income ten-fold. Clearly AMD has done more, and its financial metrics are twice as cheap compared to NVDA’s. It’s a better choice from that perspective.
The Beginning of the End of QE
Frankly, I would stay out of both unless I’m using options. There, I can sell puts to be long the stocks and leave a 30% buffer zone. Chasing markets at all-time highs with starter investment positions is wrong. Moreover, we are going into the end of a 3-year old QE program.
I don’t anticipate the Federal Reserve actively wanting to devastate markets. However, losing huge tailwinds could create a stall on Wall Street. The Jackson Hole Fed meeting is coming up, so that could also create short-term turbulence in NVDA stock. I think they will drag their feet until November to announce the taper.
Meanwhile, there are trading opportunities in Nvidia. My guess is that the markets are looking for the Fed event to pass, so they can rally more. Sharp dips are buy-able for an attempt at fast profits. However, this is different than the earlier discussion of long-term investments. This is where it’s important for us to know our objective — to trade or invest?
To be clear, my comments about waiting things out for better entries are for investors, not traders. Nvidia stock is a monster because the company is executing flawlessly. We can’t short such a scenario, so it’s a matter of finding an appropriate entry point for the long haul.

2021-08-25 00:00:00+00:00,Intel Corporation's (NASDAQ:INTC) Low P/E is Not the Reason for Excitement Yet,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intel-corporations-nasdaq%3Aintc-low-p-e-is-not-the-reason-for-excitement-yet-2021-08-25,,,"By Stjepan Kalinic
This article first appeared on Simply Wall St News .
After a furious run that saw Intel Corporation ( NASDAQ:INTC ) reach over 30% gain year-to-date, the stock has retraced almost all of it, falling back to the important support at US$52.5.
With a P/E ratio of 11.84 and a dividend yield of 2.61%, the stock is now in the value investment territory.
While the market has experienced earnings growth lately, Intel's earnings have gone into reverse gear, which is not great. It seems that many are expecting the dour earnings performance to persist, which has repressed the P/E.If you still like the company, you'd be hoping this isn't the case so that you could potentially pick up some stock while it's out of favor.
View our latest analysis for Intel
NasdaqGS:INTC Price Based on Past Earnings August 25th, 2021
If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting in the future, you should check out our free report on Intel .
Intel appears unable to break from the range, stretching back to 2018. With the bottom of the range at US$44 and the top at US$68, this is quite a wide range, with the price currently being at „ no man's land “ in the low 50's.
Does Growth Match The Low P/E?
Intel's P/E ratio would be typical for a company that's only expected to deliver limited growth, and importantly, perform worse than the market.
If we review the last year's earnings, we can see that the company's profits fell to the tune of 18%.Even so, admirably, EPS has lifted 59% in aggregate from three years ago, notwithstanding the last 12 months.Accordingly, while they would have preferred to keep the run going, shareholders would probably welcome the medium-term earnings growth rates.
Looking ahead now, EPS is anticipated to slump, contracting by 4.2% per annum during the coming three years, according to the analysts following the company.That's not great when the rest of the market is expected to grow by 12% per year.
In light of this, it's understandable that Intel's P/E would sit below most other companies.However, shrinking earnings are unlikely to lead to a stable P/E over the longer term.There's potential for the P/E to fall to even lower levels if the company doesn't improve its profitability.
Lack of Excitement Contributes to Low P/E
Generally, our preference is to limit the use of the price-to-earnings ratio to establishing what the market thinks about the overall health of a company.
Our examination of Intel's analyst forecasts revealed that its outlook for shrinking earnings contributes to its low P/E. Shareholders accept the low P/E as they concede future earnings probably won't provide any pleasant surprises.
Intel has been facing a major branding problem as it is no longer seen as an exciting growth stock – those titles currently go to its rivals like AMD or Nvidia. However, the current situation in the semiconductor market that is skewing the power of suppliers pushes it to the spot where it doesn't have to worry about the demand. This situation is likely not going to be resolved before 2023.
Until then, Intel has enough time to reinvent itself. The latest collaboration with TMSC is an important step in that direction, as Intel can leverage the production capabilities to challenge AMD and Nvidia in their dominant segments.
Finally, Intel's free cash flow generation is far ahead of its competitors; however, the attempt to keep the stock up through buybacks has not fared well. Capital investment in 2 new factories in Arizona , as well as a US$200b plan for Intel Foundry Services, looks to be a step in the right direction, as the current semiconductor shortage showed that the market is ripe for a change.
You need to note risks; for example - Intel has 2 warning signs (and 1 which makes us uncomfortable) we think you should know about.

2021-08-25 00:00:00+00:00,Intel Is Positioning Itself to Make the Comeback of the Century,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intel-is-positioning-itself-to-make-the-comeback-of-the-century-2021-08-25,,,"In this video I will be talking about why I believe Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) is making its way back to the top of the semiconductor world. Despite its recent struggles and market share loss to AMD and Nvidia, Intel remains the world's number one semiconductor company in terms of revenue. As I mentioned two months ago, I believe Intel is cheap compared to its peers. You can find the video below.
Valuation matters
Intel's current P/E stands at 11.5, which means it currently trades at a discount compared to the industry's average of 20 and to closest competitor AMD, which has a multiple of 37. Now, it makes sense for AMD to trade at a premium because it is going through a growth cycle while Intel has been stagnant for years.
But more recently, Intel has announced it will be investing $20 billion in its Arizona facility and $3.5 billion in its New Mexico one. This will allow Intel to build chips for other customers, just like TSMC. As of today, Intel has announced that it has recruited Amazon's AWS and Qualcomm to its ""Intel Foundry Services."" It might only be a matter of time before many other large corporations start using Intel's U.S.- and Europe-based fabs to build their products outside of Asia.
Intel also announced new GPUs that should compete with AMD's and Nvidia's, but they won't be available until early 2022.
Now what
According to Chinese media company UDN, Intel has purchased TSMC's remaining 3-nanometer-chip manufacturing capacity. Intel, being a much bigger player than AMD, might get earlier access to TSMC's latest manufacturing innovations.
Intel also recently announced that it has come to an agreement with the U.S. Department of Defense to establish a domestic commercial foundry infrastructure. With more than 80% of the leading manufacturing capacity being concentrated in Asia, it makes sense for the U.S. government to back a company like Intel to bring the supply chain back to the United States.

2021-08-24 00:00:00+00:00,Samsung to invest $206 bln by 2023 for post-pandemic growth,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/samsung-to-invest-%24206-bln-by-2023-for-post-pandemic-growth-2021-08-24,,,"By Heekyong Yang
SEOUL, Aug 24 (Reuters) - Samsung Group will invest 240 trillion won ($206 billion) in the next three years to expand its footprint in biopharmaceuticals, artificial intelligence, semiconductors and robotics in the post-pandemic era, Samsung Electronics Co Ltd 005930.KS said.
The jewel of South Korea's biggest conglomerate on Tuesday said the investment through 2023 will help strengthen the group's global standing in key industries such as chip-making, while allowing it to seek growth opportunities in new areas such as robotics and next-generation telecommunications.
Samsung Electronics, the world's largest memory chip maker, said the group plans to solidify technology and market leadership through mergers and acquisitions. It did not provide a breakdown of the investment figures.
The firm did not say whether the latest investment figure includes the $17 billion it was reportedly spending on a new U.S. chip contract chip factory.
The plan is 30% larger than Samsung's previous three-year strategy floated in 2018. The group decided to increase investment to retain technological leadership, especially during ""emergency situations"" at home and abroad.
""The chip industry is the safety plate of the Korean economy... Our aggressive investment is a survival strategy in a sense that once we lose our competitiveness, it is almost impossible to make a comeback,"" Samsung Electronics said in a statement.
Chip rivals including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd 2330.TW and Intel Corp INTC.O are making large investments amid a global chip shortage and intensifying competition in the advanced chip segment.
Samsung Group has 59 affiliates with assets totalling 457 trillion won, according to South Korea's Fair Trade Commission.
The investment plan comes just over a week since Samsung Group leader Jay Y. Lee was released from jail on parole following convictions for bribery and embezzlement.

2021-08-24 00:00:00+00:00,U.S. near deal for Nvidia supercomputer as it waits for delayed Intel machine -sources,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/u.s.-near-deal-for-nvidia-supercomputer-as-it-waits-for-delayed-intel-machine-sources-0,,,"By Stephen Nellis
Aug 24 (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Energy is nearing a deal to purchase a supercomputer made with chips from Nvidia Corp NVDA.O and Advanced Micro Devices Inc AMD.O as a key lab waits for a larger supercomputer from Intel Corp INTC.O that has been delayed for months, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters.
The Nvidia and AMD machine, to be called Polaris, will not be a replacement for the Intel-based Aurora machine slated for the Argonne National Lab near Chicago, which was poised to be the nation's fastest computer when announced in 2019.
Instead, Polaris, which will come online this year, will be a test machine for Argonne to start readying its software for the Intel machine, the people familiar with the matter said.
Argonne spokesperson Ben Schiltz did not immediately respond to a request for comment, nor did AMD spokesperson Aaron Grabein. Nvidia spokesperson Ken Brown declined to comment.
Intel, AMD and Nvidia are battling for market share for chips used in data centers. The United States' array of supercomputers do scientific work for healthcare, climate and other researchers, as well as performing virtual testing of the country's nuclear weapons.
Key technologies pioneered in the systems often filter down to commercial data centers in subsequent years, giving an advantage to chip companies which win the contract work.
When Aurora was first announced, Intel and Argonne said the machine would be delivered in 2021, but Intel still has not delivered the key Ponte Vecchio and Sapphire Rapids chips. Intel said in June that the Sapphire Rapids chips would not be in production until 2022, and on Tuesday Intel spokesperson Will Moss said the company remained committed to delivering the computer in 2022.
The $500 million contract called for Intel and partners to deliver a computer with so-called exaflop performance, or the ability to perform 1 quintillion - or 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 - calculations per second. Now, the first exascale computer in the United States will likely be a different machine at a different lab - Oak Ridge National Lab in Tennessee - built by Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co HPE.N with chips from AMD expected to be delivered later this year.
The Polaris machine at Argonne will not be as powerful as the Intel machine, the sources said. Based on Nvidia's A100 chips and AMD's Rome and Milan chips, the Polaris computer will be able to make some exaflop calculations but mostly work at slower speeds.
