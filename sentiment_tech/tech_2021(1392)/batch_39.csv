2021-03-18 00:00:00+00:00,China's SAIC partners with U.S. lidar maker Luminar on self-driving cars,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/chinas-saic-partners-with-u.s.-lidar-maker-luminar-on-self-driving-cars-2021-03-18,,,"By Paul Lienert
March 18 (Reuters) - SAIC Motor Corp 600104.SS, China's largest automaker, said Thursday it plans to begin offering self-driving vehicles in that market in 2022, in partnership with U.S. lidar maker Luminar Technologies LAZR.O.
Laser-based lidar sensors help detect objects ahead of and around the vehicle, and are a key component of many self-driving systems being developed by automakers and suppliers.
California-based Luminar in early March announced a deal with the self-driving software subsidiary of Volvo Cars, owned by China's Geely Automobile Holdings 0175.HK, to offer a combination hardware-software system to other automakers.
Luminar, founded in 2012, is one of several U.S. lidar manufacturers in the past year to go public via reverse mergers with blank-check companies.
SAIC, which is partnered in China with General Motors Co (GM) GM.N and Volkswagen AG (VW) VOWG_p.DE, plans to install Luminar's lidar sensors and software next year on its new R brand vehicle line and said it expects to standardize the equipment eventually across all its vehicles in China.
GM and VW are developing self-driving technology separately from SAIC - GM through its majority-owned Cruise subsidiary, VW in part with minority-owned Argo AI.
SAIC is an investor in Chinese lidar startup RoboSense, as well as other tech startups in the United States and China that are working on various aspects of self-driving vehicles.
Initially, SAIC's R line vehicles will have self-driving capability on highways, as well as advanced driver assistance features, the company said. The vehicles also will have the ability over time to upgrade their self-driving capability through over-the-air software updates, the company said.
Luminar earlier inked lidar development deals with Daimler AG's DAIGn.DE truck group and Intel Corp's INTC.O Mobileye. Luminar is also slated to supply lidar for Volvo's first self-driving cars in 2022.

2021-03-18 00:00:00+00:00,Nvidia Stock Could Jump 15% To Regain Early-2021 High,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/nvidia-stock-could-jump-15-to-regain-early-2021-high-2021-03-18,,,"Despite rising around 2.5x from its low in March 2020, we believe Nvidia stock (NASDAQ: NVDA) has room for a further 15% upside to levels it reached in February 2021. The company’s stock trades at $527 currently and is, in fact, roughly unchanged so far this year. Also, it traded at $315 in February 2020 – just before the outbreak of coronavirus – and is up more than 65% from that level. However, with the rise in gaming device and data center demand, the need for Nvidia’s data center and GPU products is expected to rise further. We believe that the stock has the potential to gain around 15% from its current levels, on the back of steady demand growth and strong FY 2021 results (Nvidia’s fiscal year ends in January). Our conclusion is based on our comparative analysis of Nvidia stock performance during the current crisis with that during the 2008 recession in our interactive dashboard.
2020 Coronavirus Crisis
Timeline of 2020 Crisis So Far:
12/12/2019: Coronavirus cases first reported in China
1/31/2020: WHO declares a global health emergency.
2/19/2020: Signs of effective containment in China and hopes of monetary easing by major central banks helps S&P 500 reach a record high
3/23/2020: S&P 500 drops 34% from the peak level seen on Feb 19, 2020, as COVID-19 cases accelerate outside China. Doesn’t help that oil prices crash in mid-March amid Saudi-led price war
Since 3/24/2020: S&P 500 recovers 78% from the lows seen on Mar 23, 2020, as the Fed’s multi-billion dollar stimulus package suppresses near-term survival anxiety and infuses liquidity into the system.
In contrast, here is how NVDA stock and the broader market fared during the 2007-08 crisis.
Timeline of 2007-08 Crisis
10/1/2007: Approximate pre-crisis peak in S&P 500 index
9/1/2008 – 10/1/2008: Accelerated market decline corresponding to Lehman bankruptcy filing (9/15/08)
3/1/2009: Approximate bottoming out of S&P 500 index
12/31/2009: Initial recovery to levels before accelerated decline (around 9/1/2008)
NVDA and S&P 500 Performance Over 2007-08 Financial Crisis
We see Nvidia stock declined from levels of around $12 in September 2008 (pre-crisis peak) to levels of around $8 in March 2009 (as the markets bottomed out), implying NVDA stock lost around 33% from its approximate pre-crisis peak. It recovered post the 2008 crisis, to levels of just above $18 in early 2010, rising by around 2.2x between March 2009 and January 2010. The S&P 500 Index saw a decline of 51%, falling from levels of 1,540 in September 2007 to 757 in March 2009. It then rallied to levels of 1,124, rising by about 48% between March 2009 and January 2010.
NVDA Fundamentals Over Recent Years
Nvidia revenues increased strongly from $9.7 billion in 2018 to $16.7 billion in 2021, due to higher revenues across all revenue segments driven by strong data center and GPU demand. Along with higher revenue, earnings also rose steadily, with EPS rising from $5.09 to $7.02 during this period.
Does NVDA Have Enough Cash Cushion To Meet Its Obligations Through The Coronavirus Crisis?
Nvidia’s total debt stands at $7 billion currently, up from $2 billion in FY 2020. However, Nvidia’s cash cushion of $11.6 billion, combined with $5.8 billion in cash from operations in FY ’21, is more than enough to cover its debt obligations and ride out the current crisis.
Conclusion
Phases of Covid-19 Crisis:
Early- to mid-March 2020: Fear of the coronavirus outbreak spreading rapidly translates into reality, with the number of cases accelerating globally
Late-March 2020 onward: Social distancing measures + lockdowns
April 2020: Fed stimulus suppresses near-term survival anxiety
May-June 2020: Recovery of demand, with gradual lifting of lockdowns – no panic anymore despite a steady increase in the number of cases
Since late 2020: Weak quarterly results, but continued improvement in demand and progress with vaccine development buoy market sentiment
With the number of new Covid-19 cases in the U.S. gradually dropping, we see the rise in gaming device and data center demand continuing, driving up demand for Nvidia’s products. This is evident from Nvidia’s full-year 2021 results, where revenues jumped to $16.7 billion from $10.9 billion in FY 2020. This also boosted EPS to $7.02 from $4.59 over this period. We believe that Nvidia stock has potential upside in the near term, and with the lockdowns being gradually lifted, data center demand could rise further. This could see Nvidia stock potentially rise around 15% from its current level, to its February 2021 high of $615.
What if you’re looking for a more balanced portfolio instead? Here’s a high quality portfolio to beat the market, with over 100% return since 2016, versus 55% for the S&P 500. Comprised of companies with strong revenue growth, healthy profits, lots of cash, and low risk, it has outperformed the broader market year after year, consistently.

2021-03-17 00:00:00+00:00,Using Artificial Intelligence to Save Coral Reefs,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/using-artificial-intelligence-to-save-coral-reefs-2021-03-17,,,"C
oral reefs are some of the most diverse ecosystems in the world, sometimes called the ""rainforests of the sea."" Coral reefs are a vital part of marine life, act as guards against forces of nature and are a key source of livelihood for millions. Unfortunately, these diverse habitats are rapidly degrading. Here’s how advanced technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) are being used to save coral reefs.
Coral reefs: Rainforests of the sea
Coral reefs are natural protectors for coastlines against storms and erosion. Healthy coral can help prevent loss of life and property from waves, floods and storms by absorbing 97% of the energy. Tropical coral reefs cover a mere 0.1% of the ocean, but an estimated 25% of marine life depends on these diverse ecosystems.
According to the Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity (TEEB) study, “approximately 850 million people live within 100 km of and derive some benefits from coral reefs, with at least 275 million depending directly on reefs for livelihoods and sustenance.” In the U.S., the total economic value of coral reef services including fisheries, tourism, and coastal protection—is over $3.4 billion each year.
Coral reefs are endangered. According to the United Nations Environment Programme, between 25 and 50% of the world’s live coral has been lost in the last 30 years. Coral reefs face many threats—natural (such as diseases, predators, and storms) as well as from human activities. Some of them involve physical damage from coastal development, dredging, quarrying, and boat anchors. Additionally, there is a cascading effect due to activities such as overfishing and coral harvesting which alter the structures of marine life. The United States Environmental Protection Agency lists the “increased ocean temperatures and changing ocean chemistry (ocean acidification)” as global threats to coral reef ecosystems. The aggregate effect of these factors together is placing pressure on 75% of coral reefs globally.
This calls for timely measures to adequately protect coral reefs from further damage.
AI to the rescue?
A crucial part of the effort towards protecting coral reefs include mapping, monitoring, analyzing, and restoring them. The process of collecting data for reef monitoring has traditionally been done by divers by capturing video footage and pictures. However, many times, divers have to interfere with their surroundings and it unintentionally affects the results of the survey. In addition, there are practical restrictions such as time spent under water. Overall, there are many gaps which exist in these approaches, be it in terms of in mapping coral reefs or real-time monitoring. Some of these gaps can be plugged in by deploying AI and machine learning.
An AI-powered solution by Accenture, Intel (INTC), and the Sulubaaï Environmental Foundation—to monitor, characterize, and analyze coral reef resiliency dubbed as project CORaiL, was announced in April 2020. The teams from Accenture, Intel, and Sulubaaï implemented an artificial concrete reef—called a Sulu-Reef Prosthesis (SRP)—to provide support for unstable coral fragments underwater. In addition to the fragments of living coral which were planted on the SRP, intelligent underwater video cameras, equipped with the Accenture Applied Intelligence Video Analytics Services Platform (VASP), were planted to detect and photograph fish in the reef surrounding the Pangatalan Island in the Philippines.
VASP uses AI, powered by Intel Xeon, Intel FPGA Programmable Acceleration Cards, and Intel Movidius VPU to count and classify the marine life. The data collected is structured using analytics enabling researchers to make data-driven decisions that will help the reef progress. The teams are now working on infrared cameras, which enable nighttime video capture to create a complete picture of the coral ecosystem.
In October 2020, the researchers from the Arizona State University Center for Global Discovery and Conservation Science have generated a global coral reef extent map using a single methodology capable of predicting the location of shallow coral reefs with nearly 90% accuracy. The researchers at ASU have further developed a new airborne mapping approach. “By combining laser-guided imaging spectroscopy and artificial intelligence, the new approach reveals unprecedented views of coral reefs below the ocean surface. The maps show where live corals persist as well as areas of degraded reef,” according to the study.
Overall, many research papers see AI and machine learning applications as a promising approach to eliminating the bottleneck in data processing for coral reef monitoring. The use of these technologies can enhance the speed of processes at a much-reduced form, and dramatically improve how coral reefs are measured and monitored worldwide.

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.

2021-03-17 00:00:00+00:00,3 Chip Stocks That Could Benefit From a Crypto Mining Boom,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-chip-stocks-that-could-benefit-from-a-crypto-mining-boom-2021-03-17,,,"Many cryptocurrencies have generated dizzying gains in recent years. The price of a single Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC), the world's top cryptocurrency, surged from just over $100 in Oct. 2013 to more than $54,000 today. Proponents of cryptocurrencies claim they're more secure and stable than fiat currencies, which are backed by governments instead of algorithms.
There are plenty of ways to ride this secular trend, including direct investments in cryptocurrencies, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and companies that own Bitcoin or accept cryptocurrency payments.
Image source: Getty Images.
Another way to play the cryptocurrency boom is to invest in chipmakers, since cryptocurrencies need to be mined with powerful chips. But Bitmain, which designs most of the ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit) chips used for mining Bitcoin, is still a privately held Chinese company.
Some investors might end their search with Bitmain, but plenty of other chipmakers could still benefit from the crypto mining boom. Let's take a closer look at three of those companies: NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA), AMD (NASDAQ: AMD), and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC).
A double-edged sword for NVIDIA
Traditional GPUs can no longer effectively mine Bitcoin for a profit, but they can still be used to mine cheaper cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH). The usage of gaming GPUs to mine those cryptocurrencies has been a double-edged sword for NVIDIA.
NVIDIA's GPU sales rose just 9% in fiscal 2017, which ended in January of the calendar year, but soared 39% in fiscal 2018 and jumped another 40% in fiscal 2019 as crypto miners hoarded its GPUs.
That feverish demand drove up prices of GPUs for NVIDIA's core market of PC gamers. When cryptocurrency prices subsequently cooled off, many miners dumped their used cards -- which throttled sales of NVIDIA's newest GPUs.
As a result, NVIDIA's GPU sales fell 7% in fiscal 2020 before recovering in fiscal 2021. To avoid another bubble, NVIDIA recently announced it would intentionally cut the ""hash rate"", which measures a chip's efficiency in mining cryptocurrencies, in half for its newest high-end GPUs. However, a group of Chinese hackers recently bypassed those limits to mine Ethereum at a full hash rate.
That news is troubling, but NVIDIA recently unveiled a new line of CMP (cryptocurrency mining processor) products for miners. These products -- which are optimized for mining, consume less power, and lack external display ports -- can help NVIDIA proactively pop the next bubble in its gaming business while profiting from the secular expansion of the crypto mining market.
An interesting opportunity for AMD's newest business
NVIDIA's main rival, AMD (NASDAQ: AMD), also struggled during the previous cryptocurrency bubble. AMD hasn't followed NVIDIA's lead by throttling hash rates or launching dedicated chips for cryptocurrency mining yet. However, the latest rumors suggest AMD could launch a crypto-only Navi GPU in the near future to prevent another crypto-induced rush on gaming GPUs.

However, AMD's future in cryptocurrency mining might rely more on its upcoming acquisition of Xilinx (NASDAQ: XLNX), the world's largest manufacturer of FPGAs (field-programmable gate arrays), instead of its GPU business. FPGAs can be reprogrammed for myriad purposes, including cryptocurrency mining, and the chips already power dedicated mining systems.
FPGAs aren't as efficient in mining tasks as ASICs, but they're more efficient than GPUs for mining popular cryptocurrencies like Ethereum if they're paired with HBM (high-bandwidth memory) chips.
AMD already expects its takeover of Xilinx, which is expected to close by the end of 2021, to expand its presence in the data center market and be ""immediately accretive"" to its margins, cash flows, and earnings per share. Adding FPGA-based cryptocurrency mining systems to that list would be a nice bonus that might boost its revenue and diversify its core business away from x86 CPUs and discrete GPUs.
But don't forget about Intel
AMD's acquisition of Xilinx directly mirrors Intel's purchase of Altera, Xilinx's biggest rival in the FPGA market, in late 2015. Intel currently sells Altera's chips through its programmable solutions group (PSG), which generated just 2% of its revenue last year.
However, rising interest in FPGA-powered mining systems as alternatives to ASIC-powered systems could boost Intel's PSG revenue over the next few years. Intel hasn't said much about cryptocurrencies, but it quietly filed a patent for an SoC (system on chip) optimized for crypto-mining tasks back in 2019. The SoC design could power mining systems running on GPUs, ASICs, and FPGAs.
Intel is currently struggling with many challenges, including development and production challenges for its latest CPUs, market share losses to AMD in the PC market, and a CEO change. However, investors shouldn't ignore Intel's turnaround efforts, its dominance of the data center market, and the growth potential of its PSG segment amid the cryptocurrency mining boom.

2021-03-16 00:00:00+00:00,Micron to put Utah chip factory up for sale as it shifts strategy,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/micron-to-put-utah-chip-factory-up-for-sale-as-it-shifts-strategy-2021-03-16,,,"By Stephen Nellis
March 16 (Reuters) - Micron Technology Inc MU.O on Tuesday said it will put a chip factory in Lehi, Utah up for sale as it quits making a type of memory chip it jointly developed with Intel Corp INTC.O nearly a decade ago.
Lehi is Idaho-based Micron's only factory making what it calls 3D Xpoint memory, a form of memory chip that aimed to find a price-to-performance sweet spot between the two dominant forms of memory chip: DRAM, which is fast but pricey, and NAND, which is slower but cheaper. The factory will be sold in a transaction expected to close by the end of this year, company officials told Reuters.
Micron introduced its first products based on the technology in 2019 with a set of solid-state drives aimed at data center customers. Sumit Sadana, Micron's chief business officer, told Reuters in an interview that they received a tepid response from customers because they would have had to re-write large portions of their software to take advantage of the new type of memory.
Low demand means Micron cannot scale up manufacturing to a high enough volume to justify the costs of continuing to develop the chips, Sadana said. He said the under-use of the factory is slated to cost Micron $400 million this year.
After exiting the 3D Xpoint market, Micron plans to shift its development efforts to take advantage of a new, faster industry standard for connecting memory chips to computing chips called Compute Express Link.
""We will have a (return) on this new investment that will be much higher because it will be easier for the software ecosystem to adopt,"" Sadana said.
Micron jointly developed the 3D Xpoint memory with Intel Corp starting in 2012. The company currently has a supply agreement with Intel that runs through the end of this year. Intel has said it plans to develop future generations of the chips, for which it uses a different brand name called ""Optane,"" at one of its factories in New Mexico.
Sadana said Micron will keep all the intellectual property associated with 3D Xpoint but is in contact with multiple potential buyers for the factory. While he could not name the parties or how much the factory might sell for, he said the bidders could go beyond memory companies to include makers of computing chips, analog chips or chip contract manufacturers.
""It's a good time to have an asset like this available, because several companies are just completely tapped out from a supply capability perspective,"" Sadana said.

2021-03-16 00:00:00+00:00,"Pick Apple Stock for Its Stability, Not Its Staggering Gains",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/pick-apple-stock-for-its-stability-not-its-staggering-gains-2021-03-16,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Since the start of 2021, the average NASDAQ stock is up over 3%. However, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is down almost 6%. To some investors, it’s a mystery. AAPL stock hasn’t done anything to justify this fall. The company continues to hit on all cylinders. The market for its devices and services remains strong.
Source: mama_mia / Shutterstock.com
But this shouldn’t be a mystery, because, like the other Cloud Czars, Apple was simply overvalued. Even at its Mar. 16 opening price of $125.70, the company has a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of nearly 33. The once-generous dividend has been cut by stock splits to about 20 cents per quarter and yields just 0.68%.
A Mature Company
Apple has become a mature company, making it hard to grow at scale. In 2020, revenues were $274 billion. In 2019, they were $260 billion. Growing sales by $14 billion meant growing them just 5%.
There are hints of market saturation. The company no longer reports how many iPhones it sells each quarter. There are reports the company is cutting orders on the iPhone 12 mini because of slow sales.
7 Triple-A-Rated Stocks to Buy Now
It’s not a disaster. Apple is still expected to ship 230 million phones this year, up 11.6% from last year. It’s just harder to move the needle.
Apple is also facing bigger threats from governments around the world. Europeans want it to pay more taxes. Its use of tax havens is under assault. Governments see companies like Apple as huge cash cows aching to be milked.
There are also threats to Apple’s app store, which takes 30% of app revenue. Spotify (NASDAQ:SPOT) is specifically targeting its European monopoly. Senator Amy Klobuchar, now chair of the Senate’s antitrust panel, has also targeted the app store.
Targets for Growth
Apple is now looking at ancillary device niches for growth, like its AirPods earbuds. The Apple Watch, which just passed 100 million total sales, is also growing rapidly. Even now, only 10% of iPhone users have one.
Furthermore, by making its own chips, Apple is unifying its device and PC operating systems, making its supply chain more resilient and creating new profit centers. PC growth, which had been lagging, could be further enhanced by compatibility. Despite losing its legal fights with Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) and watching Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) fail at creating competing products, Apple still plans to make its own modem chips by 2023.
For these reasons, analysts still pound the table for Apple stock, despite its $2.1 trillion market capitalization. Of the 26 analysts following it for Tipranks, 19 have it on their buy lists, with a price target 20% higher than where the stock trades now. The few bears, like Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) analyst Rod Hall, are objects of ridicule. But he’s not backing down and, at least through early 2021, he is right.
The Bottom Line on AAPL Stock
The myriad threats to Apple’s profitability are real. Apple is a mature company. It’s hard to grow at scale.
Despite all this I’m keeping my Apple shares. I’ve matured along with the company. I prefer stability to the go-go capital gains of my youth.
There are millions of us. As the Baby Boomers age out, there is going to be more pressure to buy stocks like Apple, which offer stable growth. We all won’t rush in. The shares will slowly build a base of support, with the P/E ratio falling to rational levels. But there’s nothing wrong with the company — just the fashions of the market.
Don’t trade AAPL stock. Invest in it. Pick it up on weakness as it’s weak today, and hold it for the long term.

About James P. O'Shaughnessy: Research guru and money manager James O'Shaughnessy forced many professional and amateur investors alike to rethink their investment beliefs when he published his 1996 bestseller, What Works on Wall Street. O'Shaughnessy back-tested 44 years ofstock market datafrom the comprehensive Standard & Poor's Compustat database to find out which quantitative strategies have worked over the years and which haven't. To the surprise of many, he concluded that price/earnings ratios aren't the best indicator of a stock's value, and that small-company stocks, contrary to popular wisdom, don't as a group have an edge on large-company stocks. Today O'Shaughnessy is the Chief Investment Officer of O'Shaughnessy Asset Management.

2021-03-16 00:00:00+00:00,New Applied Materials tools use AI to catch mistakes on chips,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/new-applied-materials-tools-use-ai-to-catch-mistakes-on-chips-2021-03-16,,,"By Stephen Nellis
SAN FRANCISCO, March 16 (Reuters) - A new semiconductor manufacturing technology from Applied Materials AMAT.O uses artificial intelligence, or AI, to spot mistakes in chips more effectively, the U.S. company said on Tuesday.
Modern chip manufacturing happens in factories that cost upward of $18 billion each to build and requires hundreds of separate steps. Ensuring that chips come off the factory line without mistakes in features that are only a few nanometers wide is critical to the ability of companies like Intel Corp INTC.O, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co 2330.TW and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd 005930.KS to turn a profit.
The new Applied tools are aimed at inspecting those chips at various times during the manufacturing process. A new optical scanner - essentially an extremely advanced camera that Applied calls Enlight - scans a silicon wafer quickly for problem areas over about 15 minutes, and then an electron microscope zooms in for a closer look.
The problem Applied aimed to solve with AI is that electron microscopes are accurate but slow. An initial optical scan might find a million possible problem areas on a silicon wafer, and it would take an electron microscope days to examine each of those areas - and much of that time would go to waste, because only a fraction of the problem areas are what chip industry veterans call ""killer"" defects that would cause the chip to malfunction.
The new artificial intelligence technology, which Applied calls ExtractAI, only needs to check about 1,000 of those possible trouble spots with the electron microscope to predict where the biggest problems will be. Keith Wells, group vice president and general manager for imaging and process control at Applied, said the AI-powered check only takes about an hour.
""It's economical for the customer to do that on every wafer,"" Wells said in an interview. ""We're telling you with high confidence that these are the really killer defects.""
Applied has been testing the system with customers since last year and said it has generated more than $400 million in revenue so far.

2021-03-15 00:00:00+00:00,AMD launches 'Milan' chip for data centers as battle with Intel intensifies,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/amd-launches-milan-chip-for-data-centers-as-battle-with-intel-intensifies-2021-03-15,,,"By Stephen Nellis
March 15 (Reuters) - Advanced Micro Devices Inc AMD.O on Monday released a new data center chip aimed at taking away more market share from rival Intel Corp INTC.O.
The company's ""Milan"" data center processor is faster than Intel's current best data center chips, the company said. Santa Clara, California-based AMD designs the chip but taps Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd 2330.TW to fabricate the chip using TSMC's 7-nanometer chipmaking process.
The use of an outside manufacturing partner has helped AMD capitalize on problems at Intel, which has a different strategy of internally making its own chips and has struggled with delays in its most recent generation of factory technology. The ""Milan"" chip and its predecessor have both outperformed Intel's chips, helping AMD gain market share and land customers such as Alphabet Inc's GOOGL.O Google.
Intel, however, plans to hit back. Analysts expect it to launch its newest ""Ice Lake"" server chip in the coming weeks, which will be the first one made on Intel's 10-nanometer manufacturing technology that is the performance equivalent of TSMC's 7-nanometer technology used for AMD's ""Milan"" chip.
Regardless of how the two chips stack up in terms of speed once both have been released, AMD is still expected to have some advantages, such as a higher number of computing cores on each chip, which lets the chip juggle more software applications at a time.
Dan McNamara, senior vice president and general manager of AMD's server business unit, said he believes the company can hang on to its lead if it continues to integrate feedback from customers into each new generation of chip.
""We're on our third generation of what we believe is a very solid value proposition and leading CPU for the data center. If we continue that cadence of execution, we think we'll stay competitive,"" he said during a press briefing.

2021-03-14 00:00:00+00:00,3 Tech Stocks for Retirees,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-tech-stocks-for-retirees-2021-03-14,,,"Many retiree investors might avoid tech stocks because they assume they're too volatile, too expensive, and don't pay stable dividends. They might also struggle to understand how the companies actually make money.
However, the tech sector is also full of mature blue-chip companies that generate stable growth, pay decent dividends, trade at low valuations, and are fairly easy to understand.
Let's take a look at three stocks that check those boxes, and why they're solid long-term investments for most retirees.
Image source: Getty Images.
1. Texas Instruments
Texas Instruments (NASDAQ: TXN) produces analog and embedded chips for a wide range of industries. These chips aren't very powerful, but newer technologies -- including 5G phones, automated industrial machines, and connected cars -- require an ever-increasing number of these chips.
Over the past few years, TI cut its production costs by about 40% by shifting from 200mm to 300mm wafers. The effects of that shift on its gross margin, net income, and free cash flow (FCF) are easy to see.
Source: YCharts
TI returns most of its FCF to shareholders via stock buybacks and dividends. It reduced its share count by 42% between 2004 and 2020, and it's raised its dividend annually for 17 straight years. It currently pays a forward yield of 2.4%, which is much higher than the 10-year Treasury's current 1.5% yield.
TI suffered a slowdown during the pandemic, especially in the auto and industrial markets, but analysts expect its revenue and earnings to both rise by 15% this year as the crisis passes. Its stock is reasonably valued at 24 times forward earnings, and it should remain a stable investment for the foreseeable future.
2. Oracle
Oracle (NYSE: ORCL) is an enterprise software company. It aggressively transformed its on-site software, including its flagship database products, into cloud-based services in recent years, and expanded its cloud ecosystem by gobbling up smaller players like NetSuite.
Like many other aging tech companies, Oracle is expanding its higher-growth cloud services to offset the sluggish sales of its on-site software. Oracle's revenue growth throughout that turnaround was anemic, but its core business continued to generate stable cash flows over the past decade.
To reward patient investors, Oracle constantly spent most of its FCF on buybacks and dividends. That's why its share count consistently declined, and it boosted the company's earnings per share -- even as its sales growth stalled out.
Source: YCharts
The critics often claimed Oracle's aggressive stock buybacks, which reduced its share count by 42% over the past decade, would impair its ability to expand its cloud-based businesses. Yet Oracle's revenue growth turned positive over the past three quarters, and analysts expect its revenue and earnings to rise 3% and 21%, respectively, for the full year.
Those are healthy growth rates for a stock that trades at just 15 times forward earnings. Its forward yield of 1.3% is admittedly low, but its low cash dividend payout ratio of 24% gives it plenty of room for future hikes.
3. Intel
Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), the world's leading maker of x86 CPUs for PCs and servers, has repeatedly stumbled in recent years.
Image source: Getty Images.
Its in-house foundry struggled to make the jump from 14nm to 10nm chips, which caused CPU shortages in 2019 and 2020 and handed a large slice of the PC market to rival AMD.
It then fumbled its transition from 10nm to 7nm chips last year, a debacle that resulted in the removal of its CEO Bob Swan, who seemed more interested in cutting costs and buying back shares than fixing the chipmaker's R&D and production issues.
Those problems seem dire, but Intel subsequently hired VMware's CEO Pat Gelsinger, who was once Intel's chief technology officer, to replace Swan. Gelsinger is expected to resolve Intel's R&D issues, sharpen its competitive edge again, and strike back hard against AMD.
That recovery won't happen overnight, and analysts still expect Intel's revenue and earnings to decline 7% and 10%, respectively, this year. But its prospects will likely brighten next year, and the stock still looks dirt-cheap at 13 times forward earnings. It also pays a decent forward yield of 2.2%, and it spent just 27% of its FCF on those payments over the past 12 months.
Intel might remain stuck in the mud for a few more quarters, but its low valuation and high yield should limit its downside potential and make it a safe investment for risk-averse retirees.

2021-03-13 00:00:00+00:00,4 Low-Risk Vanguard ETFs Perfect for Income Investors,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/4-low-risk-vanguard-etfs-perfect-for-income-investors-2021-03-13,,,"The past year hasn't been kind to income investors. Next-to-nothing interest rates have translated to next-to-nothing returns on traditionally safe fixed-income investments like bonds and CDs. To get returns that can outpace inflation, it's essential to invest in stocks.
Vanguard has a number of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that are perfect for those seeking low-risk investment income. ETFs give you the instant diversification that's almost impossible to achieve by handpicking your own stocks. And the beauty of Vanguard ETFs is that they have some of the lowest fees out there. Here are four Vanguard funds income investors should seriously consider.
Image source: Getty Images.
1. Vanguard Real Estate ETF (VNQ)
The Vanguard Real Estate Investment ETF (NYSEMKT: VNQ) offers a way to invest across the entire U.S. real estate market without buying up physical property. It invests mostly in equity real estate investment trusts (REITs), which own and operate income-generating commercial real estate.
Investing in REITs is a savvy move for income investors, because they're legally required to distribute at least 90% of their taxable income as dividends. The fund also includes a handful of real estate development and management companies.
With $61.4 billion in assets, it's by far the largest real estate ETF in the U.S. The fund has an expense ratio of 0.12%, which is cheaper than the 0.48% average for REIT ETFs. A 0.12% expense ratio means that just 12 cents of every $1,000 you invest is going toward the fund's management fees.
The VNQ has an enticing dividend yield of 3.31% as of Jan. 31. That's more than double the 1.53% that the S&P 500 offers.
2. Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF (VYM)
The Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF (NYSEMKT: VYM) is the most popular dividend ETF in the U.S. It tracks an index of 410 companies, with REITs excluded, based on their dividend forecast for the next 12 months. Its five largest holdings as of Jan. 31, 2021 were:
Johnson & Johnson
JP Morgan Chase
Procter and Gamble
Bank of America
Intel
Although the fund doesn't specifically screen stocks based on risk, it tends to be less risky compared to the broad market. That's because companies that consistently pay dividends tend to be relatively stable.
The fund's dividend yield is 3.05% as of Feb. 28. But it also offers decent potential gains. As of that same date, the ETF delivered a one-year total return of 19.68%. It has an expense ratio of just 0.06%, making it a bargain compared to the 0.41% average for similar funds.

3. Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF (VIG)
The Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF (NYSEMKT: VIG) invests in companies that not only pay dividends but also have a history of increasing their payments. It tracks the Nasdaq U.S. Dividend Achievers Select Index, which consists of 212 stocks known as Dividend Achievers, because they have at least 10 years of consecutive dividend hikes. The VIG's five largest holdings as of Jan. 31 were:
Microsoft
Walmart
Johnson & Johnson
Procter and Gamble
UnitedHealth Group
Stocks with a history of increasing their dividends are attractive to retirees, who are often hit hard by inflation. For investors in general, though, a steadily rising payout is appealing, because it indicates the company's finances are stable enough to support that dividend growth.
The VIG also has a super-low expense ratio of 0.06%. Its yield of 1.66% is lower than Vanguard's High Dividend Yield ETF, but one-year total returns as of Feb. 28 were higher at 23.62%.
4. Vanguard Value ETF (VTV)
The final fund to consider if you're seeking a low-risk investment with solid income-generating potential is the Vanguard Value ETF (NYSEMKT: VTV). The fund tracks the CRSP U.S. Large Cap Value Index.
The index starts with stocks that make up the top 85% of the U.S. stock market by market capitalization. It then uses metrics such as the price-to-book ratio, earnings to price, and dividend-to-price ratio to identify value stocks which appear to be underpriced.
Income investors tend to like value stocks, because they typically have stable revenue and earnings, and most pay dividends. The fund consists of 328 holdings, the largest of which are:
Johnson & Johnson
Berkshire Hathaway
JP Morgan Chase
Procter and Gamble
UnitedHealth Group
The VTV's one-year total returns were 21.34% as of Feb. 28, and its dividend yield was 2.44%. The expense ratio is the lowest for the ETFs discussed here at 0.04%.
Like the other funds on this list, the VTV doesn't offer huge growth potential. But the stability of its holdings and its low fees make it a strong choice for those seeking investment income.

2021-03-12 00:00:00+00:00,5 Vanguard Funds That Can Help You Retire a Millionaire,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/5-vanguard-funds-that-can-help-you-retire-a-millionaire-2021-03-12,,,"Everyone hopes to be a millionaire by the time they retire. But a lot of people think that you have to find crazy bargains on growth stocks to make that happen.
That's not the case. A well-invested portfolio that is given enough time to really benefit from compound growth will do the trick. You can set up a retirement account and gain diversified access to the stock market through just a few managed funds. Vanguard has some of the best of them in terms of low expense ratios.
These five would be excellent choices for your retirement portfolio.
America the beautiful
As Warren Buffett has often said, the United States is still the best place to invest. With $658 billion in assets under management, the Vanguard 500 Index Fund Admiral Shares (NASDAQMUTFUND: VFIA.X) is a simple way for you to do just that. Set to track the S&P 500, this fund follows the large-cap segment of the U.S. stock market pretty closely. It performs almost in complete sync with its benchmark, trailing it by less than 0.05% annually over the last few years. If you want exposure to most of the big names in the stock market, this is the play.
Another option is the Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund (NASDAQMUTFUND: VTSMX). This fund follows the CRSP US Total Market Index, so it provides diversification across essentially every company on the NYSE and the NASDAQ. Since its inception in 1992, this fund has delivered average annual gains of 10.29%, in line with the broader market.

Get those dividends
In times when Wall Street is in the midst of a major bull run, you're not going to beat the market with the Vanguard High Dividend Yield Index Fund ETF (NYSEMKT: VYM). What you will do is enjoy annual distribution yields of 3.05%, a low expense ratio of 0.08%, and an annual gain that has averaged 7.87% since the fund's inception in 2006. Some of its top holdings are Johnson & Johnson, Procter & Gamble, Intel, Walmart, and Verizon.
Growth
The Vanguard U.S. Growth Fund Admiral Shares (NASDAQMUTFUND: VWUAX) is a mutual fund based on investing in large-cap domestic growth companies. Think Amazon, Microsoft, Apple, and Netflix. This is the ""swing for the fences"" fund, with 10-year annual returns of 18.08%, beating the S&P 500, and outpacing large growth counterparts. You get all of this while paying a management fee of 0.28%.
Admittedly, investor interest has recently begun to shift toward value stocks, but many of the companies in this Vanguard fund still have upside potential.
Value
Growth investing has been the favored strategy over the last decade, but value investing has been the most successful strategy over time. The bulk of Warren Buffett's success is tied into it. So one would be remiss to exclude value stocks from one's portfolio. The Vanguard S&P 500 Value ETF (NYSEMKT: VOOV) is a great option for getting some exposure to them.
Focused on tracking the performance of the S&P 500 Value Index, this ETF has averaged returns of 11.79% annually since inception, carries a dividend of 2.26%, and includes such components as Berkshire Hathaway, JPMorgan, and Disney. You're sticking with the reliability of the S&P 500, but focusing on those tried-and-true businesses that have demonstrated an ability to deliver value for shareholders through time.
A bonus for those on the adventurous side
I personally favor investing in U.S.-based companies. If, however, one is inclined to look beyond our borders, the Vanguard International Growth Fund (NASDAQMUTFUND: VWIGX) has done well. Delivering 11.65% annual gains since inception in 1981, this mutual fund looks to invest in foreign growth companies across the large-, mid-, and small-cap categories. Its expense ratio of 0.44% is a bit higher than the other funds mentioned here, but it has been a historically competitive fund for international growth. And it outpaced the S&P 500 by roughly 40% over the last 14 months.
Vanguard funds simplify things
If you're not a seasoned investor, or simply don't want to put in the time to research a full portfolio of hand-picked securities, Vanguards' vast array of funds offer simple ways to diversify a portfolio with only a few investments. For many investors, investing in ETFs and mutual funds can produce comparable returns to buying individual stocks -- if not better -- and help them build their wealth. They might not make you into a millionaire overnight, but these funds' steady gains and dividends can work to make you a millionaire by retirement, with much less hassle and stress.

2021-03-11 00:00:00+00:00,These 5 Dividend ETFs Are a Retiree's Best Friend,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/these-5-dividend-etfs-are-a-retirees-best-friend-2021-03-11,,,"If you're looking for income in retirement or would just like cash regularly arriving in your retirement investment accounts, it's hard to go wrong with dividends. They get paid in strong markets and weak markets alike (except in relatively rare instances, when a company is struggling and needs to decrease, suspend, or eliminate its payout). And the dividends of healthy and growing companies are increased fairly frequently, too -- often once per year. Those increases help your payouts keep up with inflation -- and even exceed it.
A particularly easy and effective way to invest in dividend-paying stocks is to do so via exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that focus on dividends. (ETFs are funds that trade like stocks, permitting you to buy as few or as many shares as you'd like.) Here are five solid candidates to consider for your portfolio.

1. Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF
The Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF (NYSEMKT: VIG) is an often-recommended dividend-focused ETF. It's an index fund with very low annual fees (just 0.06%), and it tracks the Nasdaq US Dividend Achievers Select Index -- which includes securities that have increased their payouts annually for at least 10 years. The index recently featured 212 components, and the Vanguard ETF simply copies them. Its top holdings recently were Microsoft, Walmart, Johnson & Johnson, Procter & Gamble, and UnitedHealth Group, and its dividend yield was recently 1.66%.
2. Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF
The Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (NYSEMKT: SCHD) tracks the Dow Jones U.S. Dividend 100 Index, which is focused on ""high-dividend-yielding stocks in the U.S. with a record of consistently paying dividends, selected for fundamental strength relative to their peers, based on financial ratios."" It also looks for companies that are increasing their payouts. The ETF charges just 0.06% annually and has about a quarter of its assets in financial stocks, about 20% in industrials, and about 16% in consumer defensive companies. Its top holdings recently were ExxonMobil, Altria, Texas Instruments, 3M, and United Parcel Service, and the ETF recently yielded 3.4%.
3. Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF
The Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF (NYSEMKT: VYM) also charges just 0.06% annually, and tracks the FTSE High Dividend Yield Index, which focuses on high-yielding companies. It recently yielded 3.06% and held about half its assets in financials, healthcare, and consumer staples companies. Its top holdings recently were Johnson & Johnson, JPMorgan Chase, Procter & Gamble, Bank of America and Intel. The fund is market-cap weighted, meaning that the holdings that have the highest market value will be weighted more heavily in the fund. This means that smaller companies won't carry as much weight, but it also means that if any components are in trouble and shrink in size, so will the proportion of the fund they represent.
Dividends deliver cash regularly. Image source: Getty Images.
4. SPDR S&P Dividend ETF
The SPDR S&P Dividend ETF (NYSEMKT: SDY) aims to offer roughly the same performance of the S&P High Yield Dividend Aristocrats Index (less fees). Its annual fee is higher than many other dividend-focused ETFs, at 0.35%, but that's still much lower than most mutual funds. That index holds companies in the S&P Composite 1500 Index ""that have followed a managed-dividends policy of consistently increasing dividends every year for at least 20 consecutive years."" The ETF recently yielded 2.7%, and its top holdings recently were ExxonMobil, AT&T, People's United Financial, Chevron, and Federal Realty Investment Trust.
5. Invesco KBW High Dividend Yield Financial ETF
The Invesco KBW High Dividend Yield Financial ETF (NASDAQ: KBWD) is a bit different from the other funds above. It's highly focused on the financial sector (with about 70% of its assets in it, and the rest mostly in real estate) -- and it sports a much higher yield, recently 7.8%. It aims to park at least 90% of its assets in companies that are in the KBW Nasdaq Financial Sector Dividend Yield Index and that have solid dividend yields. Don't invest in this if you're bearish on the prospects of the financial services or real estate sectors, and keep up with its progress at least quarterly to ensure that it's still performing well. Its top holdings recently were Prospect Capital, Apollo Commercial Real Estate Finance, Orchid Island Capital, Ares Commercial Real Estate, and Apollo Investment. This ETF also sports a hefty annual fee of 1.24%. So invest in this ETF with your eyes open, and bail if its appealing characteristics start changing.
There are gobs of other dividend-focused ETFs and mutual funds out there, along with many terrific dividend-paying stocks, and they can deliver welcome income in retirement. A little digging might turn up some you like even more than the ones above, though these five do warrant consideration.

March 11 (Reuters) - The Biden administration this week amended licenses for companies to sell to China's Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL], further restricting companies from supplying items that can be used with 5G devices, among other conditions, sources said.
The changes could disrupt existing contracts with Huawei, based on previous licenses approved for suppliers, which they may no longer be able to deliver on, two of the sources said.
A U.S. Commerce Department spokeswoman declined to comment, saying the licensing information is subject to confidentiality.
The actions show the Biden administration is reinforcing a hard line on exports to Huawei, the telecommunications equipment maker viewed as a threat to national security.
The initial export licenses were granted by the Commerce Department after the company was blacklisted in 2019, citing a national security threat.

Everyone in the market knows that Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is having problems. It has lost market share to its competitors and is having problems producing competitive chips. However, INTC stock is already higher on the assumption the company is going to get its act together.
Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com
For example, the company hired a new CEO, Pat Gelsinger, who started in mid-February. He is supposed to turn the company around. Whether he will be successful is still up in the air.
However, the market already believes he will succeed. INTC stock is already up 28% year-to-date, as of Mar. 11, at $63.82 per share. In fact, it rose almost 2.5% in the past day alone.
The Ultimate Contrarian Stock
As a result, INTC stock is now the ultimate contrarian stock. The best time to buy it is when the stock is at its lows, when everyone is negative on it. You should buy it only when the market hates it the most.
And that is not now. It is too late. You should have bought it in late October 2020, when it was in the low $42-per-share range.
7 Stocks to Buy That Are Cheering for March Madness
For example, on Oct. 22, Intel came out with its quarterly earnings and reaffirmed that there would be delays in its seven-nanometer chip production. CNBC quoted the previous CEO Bob Swan in an interview on Oct. 23 that Intel might outsource the production of that chip. The company would be admitting defeat.
That was too much for the market. It hit its lows. Guess what? That is exactly the point at which you should have invested in INTC stock. And that does not make much sense. But, frankly, that is exactly how the market often works.
I recently wrote about this contrarian investing technique: “Always Be a Contrarian, If You Want To Pick Winning Stocks.” One of the three points I make in the article is that this is a messy and confusing process. The time of maximum uncertainty, as Sir John Templeton said, is the best time to buy. But you will not have all your questions answered at the point.
In this case, there was no way to know whether Intel would get its act together. By the way, there is no way to know even now. But so many people believe that it will fix its issues, that INTC has already rallied.

Now, in fact, the contrarian thing to do would be to sell the stock. You might actually give up some profits on the upside. But, if in fact Intel still can’t regain market share, its recent rally might be premature.
One way to know that you are on the right side of things is to do the opposite of analysts. For example, most of them believe now that INTC stock is at fair value. For example, TipRanks.com indicates that 31 analysts have an average price target in the past three months of $62.85. This is slightly below its current price today of $63.82.
In other words, buying INTC stock is not a contrarian thing to do. You want to pick the stock when analysts hate the stock most.
When I was studying for my MBA at George Washington University, one of our professors brought in a successful money manager in the Washington, D.C. area. We knew he was successful since he had taught himself to fly his own corporate jet. When he came in, he said he did not have a philosophy of picking stocks — did anyone have a question? “Yes,” someone said, “how do you know when to buy a stock?” “Simple,” he said, “I just pick through the new 52-week-low section of the NYSE. That’s it.”
We were dumbfounded. How could that work? Weren’t these the worst stocks? Well, it worked for him. And this is the theory of contrarian investing simply explained.
Here, Intel, a massive $260 billion market capitalization company, is not likely to go out of business with its huge legacy cash flow and cash and assets. Therefore, buying when everyone hated it was the best way to make money.
If you had bought INTC stock on Oct. 29, when it closed at $44.11, you would now have a 45% profit. If it moves higher from here, it will simply be gravy.
I suspect most investors should wait for another stumble in INTC stock before buying into it.

Although the theme has underperformed since 2017, rising by just about 31%, compared to the Nasdaq-100, which has more than doubled over the period, it has fared better this year, rising 1.5% year-to-date compared to the Nasdaq-100 which is down by over 4%. There’s a good chance these stocks could continue to outperform in 2021, as rising bond yields take some sheen off higher growth names with investors potentially rotating into value stocks. For perspective, the 10-year Treasury yield has risen from around 1.1% to 1.6% in just about a month. Now, value tech stocks might hit the sweet spot in this market as they trade at reasonable valuations while playing on the broader Covid-19 theme of greater digitization and higher corporate IT spends. Moreover, most of the names in our theme are mature tech companies that are incumbents in their respective segments. Within our theme, Intel stock (NASDAQ:INTC) has been the strongest performer, rising by about 20% year-to-date driven by strong semiconductor demand and some top management changes. On the other side, Marvell (NASDAQ: MRVL) a company that develops and produces semiconductors and related technology has underperformed on account of mixed quarterly earnings, with its stock declining by about 13% year-to-date.
[2/22/2021] Will Tech’s Old Guard Beat The Market In 2021?
Our theme of Value Tech Stocks has underperformed the market in recent years, rising by just about 29% since the end of 2017, compared to the S&P 500 which is up by about 46% over the same period. The theme includes tech companies that offer essential technology products and services, have a market capitalization of over $10 billion, and trade at a trailing price to earnings multiple of under 20x. In comparison, the broader NASDAQ index trades at a much higher 40x trailing P/E. However, we believe that the stocks in our theme have lower price risk in the current market environment, and at the same time could offer reasonable upside from increasing digitization and higher corporate IT spends following Covid-19. Below is a bit more about the stocks in the theme and some trends that could help to drive them higher in the near-term.
Intel stock (NASDAQ:INTC) stock has been the best performer within our theme this year so far, rising by about 26% since early January, driven by stronger than expected Q4 results and guidance for the current quarter, and also due to the appointment of new CEO Pat Gelsinger. Moreover, demand for semiconductors has been strong across the board, with many end-markets facing chip shortages. Intel, with its sizable production capacity, should stand to gain.
Cisco stock (NASDAQ:CSCO) stock is up by about 2% year-to-date. The company has been witnessing weaker demand for its networking gear as the Covid-19 pandemic caused customers to postpone deployments and also due to stronger competition. However, IT spending is expected to rebound sharply as the pandemic wanes and Cisco should be well poised to benefit. Additionally, Cisco’s pivot to a more software-centric model should also help the stock.
Oracle stock (NYSE:ORCL) stock is down by about -5.5% year-to-date. Although revenues have faced pressure in recent years as the hardware and services segments have taken a hit, the company’s cloud operations, particularly its public cloud business, could unlock a lot of value. During its most recent quarter, the company said that revenue from its Gen 2 cloud was up over 100% year-over-year. As the public cloud business continues to gain scale and the company provides more transparency, investors could potentially re-rate the stock higher.
[Updated 1/20/2021] Value Tech Stocks 
Our indicative theme of Value Tech Stocks includes relatively mature businesses that offer essential technology products and services and trade at reasonable valuations. Specifically, we have picked tech companies that are trading at a trailing price to earnings multiple of under 20x and have a market capitalization of over $10 billion. Although these stocks haven’t really rallied since our last update in November, with the Covid-19 vaccines roll out gathering steam globally, it’s likely only a matter of time before broader economic growth returns, helping value stocks, including reasonably priced technology names. Here’s a quick rundown of some value stocks in our Value tech stocks theme.
Intel (INTC) has been out of favor with investors due to increasing preference for lower-cost ARM-based chipsets and a delay in its rollout of its next-generation 7nm CPUs. However, the stock is up by about 16% year-to-date, as investors have a favorable view of Intel’s recently announced top management shakeup, which will see VMware CEO and former Intel CTO Pat Gelsinger succeed current Intel CEO, Bob Swan.
Cisco (CSCO) stock has also been listless as corporations paired back on spending on networking gear through the Covid-19 recession. However, IT spending is likely to rebound sharply over 2021 and Cisco being the go-to company for enterprise networking solutions should benefit. The company’s gradual pivoting to a more software-driven model should also help the stock. The stock is up by about 1.5% this year.
Oracle (ORCL) is a provider of database, cloud, and enterprise software products. The stock has seen steady growth over the last several years, driven by expanding earnings and its share repurchase program. The company has been expanding sales of its cloud-based applications, such as Fusion and enterprise resourcing planning services, helping to offset the slow growth of its legacy offerings. The stock is down by about -4.5% this year.
NetApp (NTAP) is a company that sells hardware and software focused on data management. While the company has seen a mixed performance in recent quarters, due to weak demand from large customers and its significant reliance on hardware sales, its increasing focus on the cloud computing market should help the stock. The stock is down 2.5% year to date.
[ Updated 11/24/2020] Is it A Good Time To Double Down On Value Tech Stocks?
Value Tech Stocks such as Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) have had a mixed year. There was good reason for this, as the deep Covid-19 recession, abundant liquidity following interest rate cuts, and the growing at-home economy drove investors to hyper-growth software as service stocks, high-risk, high reward sectors such as electric vehicles, and fast-growing platform players such as Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).
However, with the availability of multiple highly effective Covid-19 vaccines (Pfizer, Moderna, and AstraZeneca have published strong efficacy data on their vaccines) looking likely in 2021, things are likely to gradually start returning to normal. Moreover, the Fed could also eventually revisit its stance on ultra-low interest rates as the economy shows signs of picking up.  As this plays out investors could re-visit lower growth stocks that represent compelling value. While positive news about the vaccine earlier this month has already buoyed cyclical sectors such as energy, industrials, and financials we think it’s likely that funds will flow to value tech stocks in the near-to-medium term.
Our indicative theme of Value Tech Stocks includes relatively mature businesses that offer essential technology products and services and trade at reasonable valuations. Specifically, we have picked companies that are trading at a trailing price to earnings multiple of under 18x and have a market capitalization of over $10 billion. Key names in the theme include Oracle (ORCL) , VMware Inc (VMW), Seagate Technology (STX), Cisco (CSCO), and Intel (INTC).
[Updated 11/10/2020] Can Intel Stock Recover?
Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) stock has had a rough year, driven by delays in the company’s transition to the next generation 7-nano meter technology for its chips, some recent headwinds at its cloud and data center business, and strong competition from rival AMD in the PC and server CPU space. The stock is down by about 25% this year, significantly underperforming the NASDAQ which is up by over 28%. That said, there have been some positive developments that could help the company get back on track. In October, Intel announced a deal to sell its NAND business to SK Hynix for about $9 billion in a move that could allow the company to focus on its core CPU business, while bolstering its liquidity. Intel also appears to be more flexible with its manufacturing, recently noting that it could produce its next-gen chips in-house, or outsource them, or even use a hybrid model that leverages both internal and external fabs. Intel stock looks like good value at the moment, trading at just about 9.5x projected 2020 earnings. While growth could remain tepid in the near-term, Intel’s scale, its vast marketing and distribution footprint, and its large base of corporate customers, who rely on Intel processors and are likely averse to switching, should help the company in the medium to long-term.
See our indicative theme on Value Tech Stocks for a complete list of technology companies – including Intel, NetApp, and Oracle – that look like good value at the moment. The theme has underperformed this year, remaining roughly flat year-to-date, versus the S&P 500 which is up by about 10%.
[Updated 9/3/2020] Value Tech Stocks
While high-growth information technology stocks have rallied sharply this year, with valuations looking increasingly stretched, we’ve picked a few stocks including Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), and NetApp (NASDAQ:NTAP) that have relatively stable and mature businesses and still offer good value. Specifically, we have picked companies that are trading at a trailing price to earnings multiple of under 18x and have a market capitalization of over $10 billion. See our analysis Value Tech Stocks for more details on the returns and performance of these stocks. Parts of the analysis are summarized below.
Intel ($215 billion market cap, -15% YTD), the largest CPU vendor has been somewhat out of favor with investors on account of increasing competition from lower-cost ARM-based chipsets and the company’s delay in its rollout of its next-generation 7nm CPUs. However, Intel looks like good value considering its large base of existing customers, who rely on Intel processors and are likely averse to switch and also due to its vast marketing and distribution footprint. The stock trades at about 11x 2019 earnings.
Cisco ($178 billion market cap, -10% YTD), one of the largest network equipment providers, has also underperformed the market as it has struggled with top-line and bottom-line growth. However, the increasing digitization caused by the Covid-19 pandemic could drive demand for connectivity, in turn improving sales of Cisco’s networking software, and products such as switches and routers. The stock trades at about 16x FY’19 earnings.
NetApp ($10 billion market cap, -25% YTD) is a company that sells hardware and software focused on data management. While the company has seen a mixed performance this year due to weak demand from large customers and its significant reliance on hardware sales, it is looking to double down on the cloud computing market. Last month, NetApp closed a deal to acquire Spot, a leader in compute management, and cost optimization for public clouds. The stock currently trades at about 13x last fiscal year earnings.
While value tech stocks look attractive, 2020 has also created many pricing discontinuities which can offer attractive trading opportunities. For example, you’ll be surprised how the stock valuation for Apple vs. Logitech shows a disconnect with their relative operational growth. You can find many such discontinuous pairs here.
