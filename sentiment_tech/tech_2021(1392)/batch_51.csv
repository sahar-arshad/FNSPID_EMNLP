2021-11-18 00:00:00+00:00,"Ford, GlobalFoundries say they will work together to boost chip supply",MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/ford-globalfoundries-say-they-will-work-together-to-boost-chip-supply-0,,,"By Stephen Nellis and Ben Klayman
Nov 18 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co F.N and chip manufacturer GlobalFoundries Inc GFS.O on Thursday said they plan to work together to boost supplies for the automaker's vehicles and the broader U.S. auto industry but gave few details about what the deal entails.
The two companies announced a non-binding agreement that could involve increasing production capacity for Ford's current lineup and performing joint research and development on several categories of chips that are likely to be key to future cars, such as battery-management systems and self-driving systems.
Over the past year, a global chip shortage has caused Ford and other automakers to curtail vehicle production. Most companies have directed the chips they receive to their most profitable vehicles. That has led automakers to explore ways to boost access to chips.
Majority owned by Abu Dhabi's sovereign wealth fund, GlobalFoundries became publicly traded this year when it sold a stake in its business in a $26 billion initial public offering. The company has said that some of the $2.6 billion raised in the deal will go toward building a second chip factory at a site in Malta, New York.
Ford and GlobalFoundries did not disclose any terms of the deal or say whether Ford was providing funding or other commitments to reserve capacity at any of GlobalFoundries' current or future factories. The two said only that the ""strategic collaboration"" does not involve any cross-ownership between the companies.
""We hope Ford and GlobalFoundries will team up to grow the supply in a more formal way to support our current vehicle lineup and our future needs,"" Ford Vice President Chuck Gray said in an interview.
The No. 2 U.S. automaker planned to get into the business of designing its own chips and having them manufactured by a partner, Gray said. Some major automakers such as Volkswagen VOWG_p.DE have said they plan to design their own self-driving chips.
Ford and GlobalFoundries said the research will be targeted at developing new chips and working with chip suppliers around that. GlobalFoundries Senior Vice President Mike Hogan said the chips will be designed and developed at Ford's direction and built in the United States.
Ford outlined three categories of chips that it would jointly research with GlobalFoundries: autonomous driving chips, in-car data networking chips and battery management chips.
In May, Ford said it was redesigning parts to use more accessible chips and was also weighing other strategies, including signing supply deals directly with foundries that make the wafers used in semiconductors.
On Thursday, Ford Chief Executive Jim Farley said the deal with GlobalFoundries is part of Ford's plan to vertically integrate key technologies.
The market for self-driving chips is dominated by Nvidia Corp NVDA.O, Intel Corp INTC.O and Qualcomm Inc QCOM.O, some of them using advanced chipmaking technology that GlobalFoundries is not currently capable of producing.
Other categories of chips, such as networking and battery-management, are dominated by existing auto suppliers NXP NXPI.O, Marvell Technologies Inc MRVL.O and Analog Devices ADI.O, many of which either manufacture their own chips or work with GlobalFoundries rivals.
NXP, for example, has said it will use Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd's 2330.TW 5-nanometer process for future automotive chips, a capability that GlobalFoundries cannot currently match.

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.

When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher — if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.
There are 20 different analyst targets within the Zacks coverage universe contributing to that average for Marvell Technology Inc, but the average is just that — a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $50.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $100.00. The standard deviation is $11.437.
But the whole reason to look at the average MRVL price target in the first place is to tap into a ""wisdom of crowds"" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with MRVL crossing above that average target price of $73.25/share, investors in MRVL have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $73.25 just one stop on the way to an even higher target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table?

2021-11-11 00:00:00+00:00,NXP forecasts sales growth driven by connected vehicles,MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/nxp-forecasts-sales-growth-driven-by-connected-vehicles,,,"By Stephen Nellis
Nov 11 (Reuters) - Chipmaker NXP Semiconductors NXPI.O on Thursday said it believes it will hit $15 billion in sales by 2024, with much of the expansion coming from internet-connected electric vehicles.
The Dutch company already derives about half of its revenue, which it forecast will reach $11 billion this year, from the automotive sector. Speaking with Reuters after holding a presentation for investors, NXP Chief Executive Kurt Sievers said the company intended to focus on key areas where more chips are going into cars and where NXP believes it can hold a market position at least twice that of any competitor.
One of those areas is radar sensors, which are increasingly being put into cars for safety systems that can automatically brake before a collision. NXP has 44% market share in that field and $600 million in sales today, and Sievers said the company believes radar chips could hit $1 billion in sales by 2024.
But perhaps the most lucrative for NXP could be chips that help connect cars to the internet so they can be updated with new software to unlock features or services that carmakers can charge money for. Tesla Inc TSLA.O pioneered the business model, and the automotive industry is looking to adopt it more broadly.
NXP makes both the ""gateway"" chips that connect the vehicle to the internet and the ""domain controllers"" that can distribute software updates to various subsystems in the car, such as the drivetrain.
NXP competes against Marvell Technology MRVL.O in selling such chips, but Sievers said NXP believes it has leading market share.
""Tomorrow's cars will be updated over their lifetime with fresh software in order to boost performance and allow new use cases on an existing piece of hardware. And the entry door for these downloads of new software has to be highly secure,"" Sievers said.

2021-11-11 00:00:00+00:00,December 31st Options Now Available For Marvell Technology (MRVL),MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/december-31st-options-now-available-for-marvell-technology-mrvl,,,"Investors in Marvell Technology Inc (Symbol: MRVL) saw new options become available today, for the December 31st expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the MRVL options chain for the new December 31st contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $72.00 strike price has a current bid of $3.50. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $72.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $68.50 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of MRVL, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $72.91/share today.
Because the $72.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 100%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 4.86% return on the cash commitment, or 35.49% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Marvell Technology Inc, and highlighting in green where the $72.00 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $74.00 strike price has a current bid of $3.20. If an investor was to purchase shares of MRVL stock at the current price level of $72.91/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $74.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 5.88% if the stock gets called away at the December 31st expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if MRVL shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Marvell Technology Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing MRVL's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $74.00 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $74.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 4.39% boost of extra return to the investor, or 32.04% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.
Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $72.91) to be 39%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

(NASDAQ:MRVL) On Your Watch List?",MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/at-us%2471.86-is-it-time-to-put-marvell-technology-inc.-nasdaq%3Amrvl-on-your-watch-list,,,"Marvell Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRVL) saw a significant share price rise of over 20% in the past couple of months on the NASDAQGS. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Let’s examine Marvell Technology’s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there’s still a bargain opportunity.
What's the opportunity in Marvell Technology?
Marvell Technology appears to be overvalued by 27% at the moment, based on my discounted cash flow valuation. The stock is currently priced at US$71.86 on the market compared to my intrinsic value of $56.45. This means that the opportunity to buy Marvell Technology at a good price has disappeared! But, is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Given that Marvell Technology’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.
What kind of growth will Marvell Technology generate?
NasdaqGS:MRVL Earnings and Revenue Growth November 8th 2021
Investors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to grow by 73% over the next year, the near-term future seems bright for Marvell Technology. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.
What this means for you:
Are you a shareholder? MRVL’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading above its fair value. At this current price, shareholders may be asking a different question – should I sell? If you believe MRVL should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards its real value can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.
Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on MRVL for a while, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its true value, which means there’s no upside from mispricing.

2021-11-05 00:00:00+00:00,First Week of December 17th Options Trading For Marvell Technology (MRVL),MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/first-week-of-december-17th-options-trading-for-marvell-technology-mrvl-2021-11-05,,,"Investors in Marvell Technology Inc (Symbol: MRVL) saw new options become available this week, for the December 17th expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the MRVL options chain for the new December 17th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $70.00 strike price has a current bid of $2.94. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $70.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $67.06 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of MRVL, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $72.01/share today.
Because the $70.00 strike represents an approximate 3% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 61%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 4.20% return on the cash commitment, or 36.46% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Marvell Technology Inc, and highlighting in green where the $70.00 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $72.50 strike price has a current bid of $3.60. If an investor was to purchase shares of MRVL stock at the current price level of $72.01/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $72.50. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 5.68% if the stock gets called away at the December 17th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if MRVL shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Marvell Technology Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing MRVL's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $72.50 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $72.50 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 49%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 5.00% boost of extra return to the investor, or 43.40% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.
The implied volatility in the put contract example, as well as the call contract example, are both approximately 41%.
Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $72.01) to be 40%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

BRUSSELS, Oct 27 (Reuters) - Nvidia NVDA.O suffered a setback on Wednesday as EU antitrust regulators opened a full-scale investigation into its $54 billion bid for British chip designer ARM on concerns the deal could lead to higher prices, less choice and reduced innovation.
Britain's competition agency is also probing the deal for the country's most important technology company, warning that it could damage competition and weaken rivals.
Reuters reported the European Commission viewed as insufficient concessions offered by the world's biggest maker of graphics and artificial intelligence (AI) chips during its preliminary review. .
Nvidia has not disclosed what these are but it has previously said it would maintain ARM as a neutral technology supplier to sooth concerns from customers such as Qualcomm Inc QCOM.O, Samsung Electronics Co Ltd 005930.KS and Apple Inc AAPL.O.
The Commission said it would decide by March 15 whether to clear or block the deal.
""Whilst Arm and Nvidia do not directly compete, Arm's IP is an important input in products competing with those of Nvidia, for example in datacentres, automotive and in Internet of Things,"" EU competition chief Margrethe Vestager said in a statement.
""Our analysis shows that the acquisition of Arm by Nvidia could lead to restricted or degraded access to Arm's IP, with distortive effects in many markets where semiconductors are used,"" she continued.

2021-10-26 00:00:00+00:00,"Marvell, Teradyne: Are 5G Stocks Worth A Look Despite Near-term Headwinds?",MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/marvell-teradyne%3A-are-5g-stocks-worth-a-look-despite-near-term-headwinds-2021-10-26,,,"Our indicative theme of 5G Stocks – which includes U.S.-based companies that stand to benefit from the ongoing transition of the wireless industry to 5G – is up by about 19% year-to-date, marginally underperforming to the S&P 500 which is up by about 21% over the same period. However, the theme has meaningfully outperformed from the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic, rising by almost 97% since the end of February 2020, compared to a return of around 53% on the S&P 500.
While Apple’s new upgraded 5G iPhone 13 handsets and attractive carrier promotions are likely to drive the adoption of 5G services in North America, some companies in the theme are being weighed down by the ongoing semiconductor shortage and logistical issues, which is hurting their ability to cater to demand. That said, the longer-term outlook for the theme remains strong, as 5G is likely to find broad applications well beyond smartphones, in areas such as industrial automation, driverless cars, healthcare, and smart cities. The U.S. government is also prioritizing 5G as it looks to get a leg up over China, which is seen as one of the leaders in the 5G space. Research firm CCS Insight estimates that global 5G connections will triple this year to 637 million and more than double to around 1.34 billion connections next year.
Within our theme, Marvell Technology Group (MRVL), a semiconductor solutions company, has been the strongest performer with its stock rising by about 40% year-to-date. On the other side, Teradyne (TER), a company that provides automatic test equipment, has been the weakest performer, with its stock down by about 2% year-to-date.
[4/9/2021] How Is The Semiconductor Shortage Impacting 5G Stocks?
Our indicative theme of 5G Stocks – which includes U.S.-based companies that stand to benefit from the ongoing transition of the wireless industry to 5G – is up by about 8% year-to-date, compared to the S&P 500 which is up by about 9% over the same period. The theme has outperformed since the end of 2019, rising by about 45%, compared to the S&P 500 which is up by about 27% over the same period. So what’s the outlook like for the theme?
While longer-term demand for 5G products is likely to be robust, with carriers doubling down on 5G spectrum and smartphone makers pushing lower-priced 5G  handsets, there could be some near-term headwinds for the industry due to the global shortage of semiconductors. Although the automotive industry has borne the brunt of the shortage thus far, the issue appears to be spilling over to the telecom space as well, given that semiconductors are at the heart of smartphones and wireless networking products.
The shortage is having a mixed impact on the various companies in our theme. Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) has been the strongest performer, rising by about 24% year-to-date, considering that the company operates some of its own fabs, reducing its exposure to the current supply crunch. Qorvo stock has also fared well, rising by about 16% year-to-date, as the company also operates its own foundries which should give it adequate supply, while potentially benefiting from higher pricing. On the other hand, modem supplier Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), which is a fabless semiconductor company that depends on third parties to produce its chips, has been the worst performer as it struggles to keep up with demand. The stock has declined by about 8% this year.
[3/4/2021] Will 5G Stocks Benefit From Spectrum Auctions? 
Our indicative theme of 5G Stocks – which includes U.S.-based companies that stand to benefit from the ongoing transition of the wireless industry to 5G – is down by about -1.6% year-to-date, compared to the S&P 500 which is up by about 2% over the same period. However, the theme has outperformed since the end of 2019, rising by about 32%, compared to the S&P 500 which is up by about 19%. Within our theme, Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) has been the strongest performer, rising by about 15% year-to-date. On the other side, Qualcomm (QCOM) has fared the worst, declining by about -14%. Here’s a rundown of some of the recent developments in the 5G space, and how could they impact the stocks in our theme.
Smartphone sales rebounded in Q4 2020, rising by about 4.3% year-over-year per IDC, after seeing a decline in the earlier part of 2020, indicating that 2021 could be a stronger year for the smartphone market. Moreover, premium vendor Apple, which has moved its entire flagship line-up to 5G, emerged as the largest smartphone vendor by volume and this is likely to speed up the industry’s shift to the new technology. Separately, the 5G C-band spectrum auctions conducted by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission a few weeks ago were much stronger than expected, with bids totaling a record $81 billion, ahead of the previous FCC auction record of about $45 billion. For perspective, this time around, Verizon alone has committed $45 billion towards the spectrum. Although it could take some time before carriers start deploying these airwaves,  it does underscore just how vital 5G is for carriers and should potentially help to drive sales of 5G equipment and infrastructure in the coming quarters.
[2/2/2021] 5G Will Come Of Age In 2021. Which 5G Stocks Should You Pick?
5G wireless technology is likely to see more widespread adoption through 2021, as Apple scales up production of its 5G equipped iPhone 12, with other players like Samsung launching more mass-market versions of their 5G smartphones. Wireless carriers are also likely to invest in improving 5G coverage, particularly for the faster version of the technology called mmWave, which is largely restricted to urban areas at the moment. The growing adoption of 5G is likely to help a range of companies including semiconductor companies, tower infrastructure companies, testing equipment manufacturers, and wireless carriers.  Our indicative theme of 5G Stocks – which includes U.S.-based companies that stand to benefit from 5G upgrades – is up by about 8% year-to-date, compared to a 0.6% gain for the S&P 500. Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS) – a radio frequency chip provider – has been the strongest performer in our theme, rising by about 20% year-to-date, driven by strong quarterly results and soaring demand from Apple, its largest customer. On the other hand, U.S. wireless behemoth Verizon (NYSE:VZ) has been the worst performer, declining by about -8% year-to-date, as its subscriber and revenue growth over the most recent quarter fell below street estimates.
[Updated 11/25/2021] 5G Stocks Benefit From iPhone 12 Tailwinds
5G has emerged as a hot investment theme this year. While major U.S. carriers have been upgrading to the next-gen technology for over a year now, consumer adoption is also likely to pick up meaningfully as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has embraced the technology relatively early in the cycle, equipping its entire flagship iPhone 12 line-up with 5G radios. Carriers are also heavily promoting 5G devices, with the new iPhones effectively available for free for subscribers with trade-ins and some other commitments. As 5G adoption grows, it should have a positive impact on demand across a wide range of companies, ranging from semiconductor players, tower infrastructure companies, testing equipment manufacturers, and wireless carriers. Moreover, 5G technology is likely to find much broader applications beyond smartphones, potentially in areas such as industrial automation, driverless cars, healthcare, and smart cities. Our indicative theme of 5G Stocks – which includes U.S. listed companies that stand to benefit from 5G upgrades – is up by 27% year-to-date, compared to an 11% gain for the S&P 500. Qualcomm (QCOM) was the biggest driver of the theme’s return, as it rallied by 68% year-to-date. On the other side, Verizon (VZ) stock is down by about 2% year-to-date.
[Updated 10/7/2020] Verizon, Qualcomm, Qorvo: Stocks To Watch As Apple Preps 5G iPhones
Our indicative theme of 5G stocks – which includes semiconductor players, tower infrastructure companies, testing equipment providers, and wireless carriers that stand to gain from the next-generation networks –  is up by about 19% year-to-date, versus 5.5% for the S&P 500 as of 10/7/2020. While 5G wireless networks are being rolled out in the U.S. and other developed markets, mainstream adoption of the technology is likely to gather pace as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) – one of the largest and most iconic smartphone vendors – is set to unveil its first set of 5G handsets next week. Below, we provide a bit more about some of the companies in our theme, how the 5G upgrade cycle could benefit them, and how they have fared thus far in 2020.
Qualcomm (QCOM), one of the largest modem and mobile processor vendors, is seen as a leader in 5G wireless technology. The company could see sales pick up as smartphone behemoth Apple is widely expected to use Qualcomm’s modems in its new iPhones. The stock is up 38% year-to-date.
Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) sells analog semiconductors that include power amplifiers, front-end modules, and radio frequency (RF) products that go into mobile and wireless devices as well as wireless infrastructure equipment. The company counts Apple as one of its biggest customers. The stock is up 23% this year.
Qorvo, Inc. (QRVO)also supplies RF components to smartphone players such as Apple, as well as to the infrastructure, and defense space. The stock is up 13% this year.  (See our analysis Is Skyworks A Better Bet Than Qorvo?)
American Tower Corp (AMT), the largest U.S.-based tower leasing company, is structured as a real estate investment trust (REIT). Tower companies stand to gain from 5G considering that antennas and other equipment for 5G are heavier and larger, meaning that rentals could also be higher. The stock is up about 6% year-to-date.
Verizon (VZ) , one of the largest U.S. wireless carriers, stands to benefit from 5G related subscriber additions and potentially improved pricing for 5G plans. The stock has remained roughly flat year-to-date.
Keysight Technologies (KEYS)provides electronics test and measurement equipment and software targeted at the wireless sector. Keysight should benefit as the 5G rollout gathers speed globally, as equipment and chip manufacturers who want to design and develop 5G products likely require its testing and measuring solutions. The stock is down 3% year-to-date.

*Stock Advisor returns as of October 20, 2021
Brian Withers: Bhanu asked, ""Motley Fool Premium members,"" which we are talking to Premium members here this afternoon, ""get more stock recommendations than capital they have, or is it me or do other feels the same?"" Yes, I totally get that, Bhanu. You are not alone by any stretch. ""If one has 30-35 stocks, how do you use the Fool services, take new positions from every service, or expanding existing positions that are doing good when your capital is limited."" Anybody want to take a crack at that one?
Jason Hall: I'll jump in real quick with just a quick 20 seconds on this, because this is something I've thought about a lot and I've been involved in some capacity with a lot of the services as a contractor over the years. I think what you have to be careful with is the fact that particularly a lot of the real money portfolios, their portfolio construction, and you run the risk if you start cherry-picking. Particularly like if you look at 10x, or rising stars, or some of these really high-growth ones. These portfolios are built on the idea that 20 percent of those stocks are going to generate 80 percent or more of the gains. If they recommend 30 stocks in a portfolio or 40 stocks in a portfolio and you buy eight or 10, it's really easy because of our individual biases to pick eight or 10 that you're familiar with or you like already, and you miss some businesses that you just don't know anything about.
I think the fact that with zero trading fees and fractional investing, basically, all of the top discount brokers allow that. I think if you're going to pay up, you're going to pay the price to join these sorts of services. Set aside enough capital that even if you're only putting it $100 or $200 per stock. I think the smartest way to get the returns that these portfolios are trying to generate that you're signing up for, is even if you have a small bit of each one of them, your best thing is to buy them all, or you have to invest a lot of time and really do the true due diligence to pick the ones that you want. I think that you almost have to take advantage of it the best way by just break up your capital and do some fractional investing.
Demitri Kalogeropoulos: That's a good point. I would just add, Jason, that I haven't thought about this question so much, but just off the top of my head. That's a good problem to not have, number 1, you have a lot of good businesses are doing some amazing things today, and so that's exciting. But what's worked personally for me, if you look at it in terms of a company that you like, something that you're connected to, something that you admire, something that you're likely to hold on to for a long time, you understand it. Those kind of companies, the ones I would tend to want to purchase. Just I think the first company I ever bought was a Motley Fool recommendation, it's Marvel. You guys would know that one, of course.
Hall: That worked out OK.
Kalogeropoulos: It worked out OK and then [laughs] it's the reason I own so much Disney right now. But I remember one of my first experiences as an investor just been like I went to an Iron Man movie and I just remember reading about that in the quarterly reports and then they release it, and then I went to the theaters to watch the movie and just feeling that cool like I own a piece of this movie sort of thing. That feeling I think it's going to help you hold on to the stock for a lot longer. Usually, that's the best predictor of your returns going over the long term. A company that you admire, I would tilt in that direction if you can.
Neil Patel: I'll just add quickly, like we talked about earlier, just depends how much time you're willing to put into this. If you don't have extra time then buying, like Jason said, putting a small amount of money into the total portfolio is the best way to go. Because if you're just going to cherry-pick stocks, there's a chance you're going to miss out on the losers, there is a chance you're going to miss out on the big winners. You're not putting in a time to figure that out. If you're just taking that by your gut check. So it depends. Like Demitri said, if you are willing to put the time in companies, number 1, that you understand, that are simple, that you're interested in, it's a good place to start, and something that you're going to keep tabs on going forward. This is a fluid dynamic thing where you're following a company hopefully for five years or longer. So you want to have a company that you can grasp fully that you will take the time to pay attention to. It goes to the points that both you guys made.

*Stock Advisor returns as of September 17, 2021
This video was recorded on Oct. 15, 2021.
Chris Hill: It's a Motley Fool Money radio show. I'm Chris Hill. Joining me this week, senior analysts Jason Moser and Maria Gallagher. Good to see you both.
Maria Gallagher: Good to see you.
Hill: We've got the latest headlines from Wall Street. We will preview next week's events from Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Google, and more. As always, we've got a couple of stocks on our radar but we begin with the big macro. Retail sales in the month of September rose 0.7% which may not sound like a lot, but that was nearly a full percentage point higher than what economists were expecting. Maria, still a lot of X-factors out there in the economy but this was a really nice surprise.
Gallagher: Yeah, this was a great surprise and it's due to a couple of things. We are actually in the highest inflation environment in the U.S. in about 30 years. You see a lot of goods in short supply with supply chain constraints in full effect for goods people want to purchase, such as electronics and cars. However, retail sales are still increasing faster than inflation. So sales are up 14% compared to a 5.4% increase in the Consumer Price Index. It's still really strong consumption numbers out of the U.S. I think it's going to be really interesting to see how early holiday season shopping starts this year because they are telling us to start now due to the supply chain constraints. I wonder how many people are going to take them up on it or what November, December is going to look like in the next couple of months.
Hill: Jason, you think about the factors Maria just highlighted combined with some of the back-to-school shopping season. Again, great to see, particularly since the expectation was for a slight drop.
Jason Moser: I mean, I think she keyed in certainly on the shopping early. People are shopping earlier than usual. I mean, we've seen Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) already starting their Black Friday sales. Target (NYSE: TGT) doing something similar. I mean, this is just going to continue throughout the rest of the year. I think it's one thing I was thinking about, too. It's also worth remembering there are more ways to spend now. I mean, you've got high deposit balances, but I mean, look at the traction that buy now, pay later is gaining over this last year. I mean, it's giving consumers another way to pay, which I think that is stoking some demand there. It's nice to see likely some pull-forward here for early holiday season shopping but if supply chain issues can resolve themselves, maybe it's a bit more sustainable. I think it's something I'm going to keep an eye on, certainly, Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS) recently cut their U.S. GDP growth forecast for 2022 from 4.4% to 4%. They were citing just basic macro concerns, questions regarding policy decisions in D.C., and supply chain issues. If we see those problems resolve themselves, these numbers could certainly be a little bit more sustainable.
Hill: Speaking of Goldman Sachs, earnings season kicked off this week with the big banks going first. JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: JPM), Bank of America (NYSE: BAC), Goldman Sachs, Wells Fargo (NYSE: WFC), all out with third-quarter reports. Jason, I'm not going to ask you to go through each one individually, [laughs] but let's start here. In your opinion, who looked the best this week?
Moser: Well, if I'm looking at Bank of America, Wells, JPMorgan, and Goldman, I mean, they all performed well, but I think I'd actually give Bank of America the win there. Just the numbers, generally speaking, revenue up 12%, net interest income was up 10%. That was thanks in part to a really healthy boost to deposits. So just talking about those deposit numbers, well, Bank of America grew deposits 15% record investment banking net income $1.2 billion, and they were able to release $1.1 billion in reserves. They continue to really just kill it on the digital platform. They have 41 million customers actively using their digital platform now and I'm one of them. I can tell you just from a customer's perspective, they've really have nailed it on the digital banking front. A lot of things to like about what Bank of America is doing.
Hill: JPMorgan Chase is by far the biggest of the big banks with Jamie Dimon at the helm, any takeaways from either their report or theirearnings call
Moser: You listen to Jamie Dimon talk about the supply chain issues. He said on the call, he didn't think we'll be talking about this stuff in the year. He really does view it as just a temporary bump in the road and that we're frankly, that we're focusing on it a little bit too much. He sees it as dampening a fairly good economy, not reversing a fairly good economy. We'll have to see how his sentiments change or remain the same there as the year goes on. I think, generally speaking, for banks on the bottom line, it remains a very strong environment for investment banking. Still a somewhat challenging time on the lending side, though, between these high deposit balances and low interest rates. That's getting ready to change and that's good because banks are going to have to start weaning themselves off that credit reserves release crush that they've been benefiting from over the last several quarters. Feels like Jamie Dimon sees some light at the end of the tunnel there certainly in regard to the supply chain stuff. So hopefully that will come to fruition.
Hill: Domino's third-quarter profits came in higher than expected but for the first time since 2011, same-store sales in the US were negative. Shares of Domino's down a bit this week, Maria, impressive streak, but it has come to an end.
Gallagher: Yes. U.S. same-store sales were down about 1.9%, still about over two years, it's up about 15%. Like you said, it beat expectations on earnings. [laughs] Strong international growth as well. It had a continuation of really healthy growth within their store openings. They've opened 323 stores in the quarter, 45 in the U.S., and 270 internationally. What I think is actually really interesting about this story, though, is a lot of the reasoning behind this decline that CEO Richard Allison said, was a shortage of workers and a decrease in spending due to stimulus checks. He said that they are actually in the toughest staffing environment they've seen in a really long time. Some stores have had to cut their hours. They are working on increasing wages, increasing investment in technology. I think that that's a trend we're going to see more and more with these businesses that mainly employ hourly, low-wage workers, that they're really needing to step up their wages and their benefits to encourage workers to go back. I'm going to be intrigued to see in this upcoming earnings season how many other similar companies talk about those constraints in terms of staffing?
Hill: You mentioned the store openings that they're doing. I think if you're a longtime Domino's shareholder, you've done quite well. As I said, the same-store sales growth streak is over but one of the many things that Domino's does well is picking new locations like their track record in terms of new locations that they then have to close is really impressive but I'm wondering if they gave any call about the next few months. Just because I look at this report, I think Halloween is in a couple of weeks. For all the talk of Super Bowl Sunday, Halloween is a really huge day for pizza.
Gallagher: He talked a little bit about trying to get more of those staffers back in that they are seeing a better staffing environment in the next couple of months, they have some new oven-baked dips that are out including a baked apple dip. So I think they are trying to lean into the fall festivities. They were trying to show positivity moving forward and not trying to really temper expectations moving forward. I think they were saying it was a blip and we're trying to get back to growth soon and they now have over 18,000 stores at the end of September. Like you said, they're really good in opening stores in good locations and they don't close them that often. I think it's a little bit of a blip, but hopefully not too big.
Hill: One tech giant is leaving China and one space stock is losing altitude. Details after the break. So stay right here. You're listening to Motley Fool Money. [MUSIC] Welcome back to Motley Fool Money. Chris Hill here with Maria Gallagher and Jason Moser. Shares of Virgin Galactic fell 15% on Friday after the company said it would delay its commercial space service to the end of 2022. Virgin Galactic says that it is taking more time to improve its space vehicles, which Maria, I have to believe future customers appreciate. But the fact of the matter is, at this moment, Virgin Galactic is losing the space race.
Gallagher: Yeah. They pushed it back about a month. Initially, they said quarter 3, 2022. Now they're guiding for quarter 4, 2022. I agree that if there's any group that I want to be prioritizing my safety it would be planes and large vehicles. I think that that's not going to hurt their customers too much. But I will say that when they did launch Unity 2022, their first space fight with a full crew, they got about 19 million views via livestream and third-party broadcast. People are still intrigued by this concept. People are still interested. I think people are still going to watch it even if full fight buyouts start at about $450,000. The amount of customers they have is still a pretty narrow window. But they actually really retained their prepaid customers. Not many people are dropping out due to these delays and they are reopening commercial pre-booking for flight. I'm curious to see how many people are going to sign up now that it seems a lot more possible. I feel like the past couple of years it's been this thing that might happen sometime soon and even just pushing it back a month. I do still think that by the end of 2022, this does seem like a real viable possibility. I'd be interested to see how many people sign up now that pre-booking is opening again.
Hill: It will be interesting to see once we get to actual operations and therefore actual results for Virgin Galactic. Because unfortunately for them, this happens just a couple of days after William Shatner goes up in Blue Origin and comes back and they get all of the attention. I understand the drop in this stock because Virgin Galactic has not yet earned the benefit of the doubt.
Gallagher: Yeah. I will say I don't know if you saw what William Shatner said when he came back down. He really raved about the flight, which I think I was someone who made fun of it a little bit and looks like it's just taking an airplane a little bit higher than most people take an airplane. [laughs] I wasn't too impressed by it. But he was so enthusiastic that I think it would make people who maybe weren't sure about it, make them more willing to go until maybe that they go on Virgin Galactic, maybe they go Blue Origin, but I do think he could be a good spokesperson for it.
Hill: Shopify is teaming up with Microsoft and Oracle to help merchants streamline their business operations. Jason, do I have this right, Shopify gets to invest further in their merchant businesses. Microsoft and Oracle get the chance to grow their cloud operations as they compete with AWS. That's how this looks. If that's the case, this seems like a win for everyone involved.
Moser: Yeah. I think you said it exactly. It is a win-win. I like this from a number of angles. I think for a business like Shopify, I'd love to see companies like Shopify and even Square (NYSE: SQ) to an extent, working on building the tools for merchants, particularly in regard to e-commerce. The numbers obviously are impressive when it comes to e-commerce. But I think when you consider Shopify, it's really impressive. To be honest, in 2020, Shopify held 8.6% of the U.S. retail e-commerce market. Now, that was second only to Amazon and their 39%. I think it shows you a couple of things there and that Shopify maintains an impressive presence already in our U.S. e-commerce market. They've picked up a lot of share very quickly. When you look at where Amazon is today, I think that really just demonstrates the opportunity that's still out in front for Shopify. When you see them doing things like this, you look at the tools that they continue to build -- Shop Pay integrations on Facebook (NASDAQ: FB) and Google properties. As e-commerce continues its shift to mobile, this experience is just going to have to get better and better. I think really that is going to be one of the benefits of this tie-up. Integrating these types of solutions with big partners like Microsoft and Oracle, it eliminates, I think, a layer of complexity. Again, it is a win for both of them as well in that they are getting a little bit more to the forefront in a market that historically is centered around AWS.
Hill: Now, I get that Shopify, when you look at it on the surface is not the cheapest stock in the world. But among other things, not that Shopify needed validation, but to strike a partnership like this with legacy tech giants like Oracle and Microsoft, it really seems like the runway is still there for the business and then therefore the stock.
Moser: Yeah. I'm glad you said something about the valuation because it is very easy to look at Shopify just on the surface and say, wow, this is a $175 billion company now go on something like 4 billion dollars in revenue. There is some disconnect there it would seem. But I think you go back to looking at that market opportunity. That's why we focus on those large and growing market opportunities because they represent just so much. It is just so much opportunity for them to capture. So yes, the market is pulling a lot of that forward. But when you see companies that really do dominate and help shape their respective spaces, we've seen this play out with companies like Amazon before. It just, you sit there all along the way saying it's too expensive, and then at some point 10 years down the road, you look back and you're kicking yourself because you never bought those shares. It's a good performance thus far for Shopify. But I think based on those numbers, that market opportunity, it's still out there. It strikes me as one that still has a ton of share to capture. Therefore shareholders, I think, who remain patient should do very well with this one through the years.
Hill: This week, Microsoft announced it is shutting down its LinkedIn operations in China. LinkedIn was the last major American social network operating in China, but Microsoft says the operating environment is more challenging. Maria, it seems like on some level, they just said, ""You know what, this is no longer worth it for us.""
Gallagher: Yeah. This comes after a Chinese internet regulator told LinkedIn to better moderate its content, gave it 36-day deadline. I think they said, it's too much should try and make it the same as LinkedIn. They are actually going to go back and launch a China-specific version of LinkedIn later this year. There will be no feeds, no ability to share a post, so no social aspect. It will just be more focused on job searching but China is LinkedIn's third-largest market and LinkedIn brings in about 10 billion in annual revenue to Microsoft. It's in their best interest to continue to have some presence in the country and try to monetize it the best way that they can. But I think the way it exists right now with such a social aspect just wasn't working for them but I also didn't realize one, that LinkedIn brought in that much revenue to Microsoft or how big it is. Throughout the world, LinkedIn has over 740 million members, over 55 million registered companies, 14 million open jobs listed on it, and three people are hired through LinkedIn every minute. It is one of the social medias that's really monetized well and shows a really strong use case for users to pay for it, both businesses and people searching for jobs. I thought that was pretty interesting to learn about. I think that it is definitely within their best interest to still have some presence. But I think pivoting and changing the social aspects is really they don't have much of a choice, it seems.
Hill: They don't have much of a choice. But also it seems like it could be a test that Microsoft might not have undertaken on their own. If they launch this in China and it doesn't have the social aspect, Microsoft may end up learning things about how this new version of LinkedIn works. Maybe it gives some insights into how do we improve it in other parts of the world?
Gallagher: Yeah, absolutely. Kind of a test case for seeing what part of the job market is that social interaction and messaging people after you interview with them or something like that and trying to connect with people versus how much of it is just finding the job and applying for it. I think that you're right, that could be a really interesting study for them to do to see how much of this value is in the social aspects, how much value is in the jobs aspect, and trying to make it more efficient worldwide after that.
Hill: Restaurant Brands International is the parent company of Burger King, Tim Hortons, and Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen. Shares are down a bit from their 52-week high, but that could change after next week. Popeyes will unveil a new hot sauce in partnership with Grammy award-winning artist Megan Thee Stallion. Yes, Megan Thee Stallion Hottie Sauce is going to debut on Oct. 19. Moser, this is part of a deal that includes new merchandise, philanthropic work in Houston, Texas. I like this. Not just because it's fun, but we've seen this business strategy work between McDonald's (NYSE: MCD) and musical acts like BTS and Travis Scott.
Moser: Yeah, I'm with you. I think that for whatever reason, these types of relationships, particularly when they pertain to food, they tend to work out very well. It's a matter of getting with the moment. What's that -- the zeitgeist? You want to be a part of that moment and clearly, Megan Thee Stallion is part of the moment that's happening right now. Popeye's and Megan Thee Stallion, to me it's just like chocolate peanut butter. This has the potential to be a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup success. I love these types of deals. Moreover, if I was someone who was asked to participate in something like this and they wanted to make a sauce after me, I would actually go barbecue rub, I would actually go rub. Dizzy Pig, if you're listening and you want to do a JMo rub, give me call.
Hill: Maria, 10 seconds. What are you partnering with if they come to you?
Gallagher: Oh, absolutely Ben and Jerry's. I would make an ice cream in one second and I'm a faithful buyer of all celebrities' Ben and Jerry's flavors.
Hill: [MUSIC] What should investors expect from Apple and Google next week? We'll get into that and more after the break. So stay right here. You're listening to Motley Fool Money. [MUSIC] Welcome back to Motley Fool Money. Chris Hill here with Jason Moser and Maria Gallagher. Time for a round of buy, sell, or hold. I'm going to spot you up with the topic. You tell me if that thing was a stock, would you buy, sell, or hold it? Maria, next week, Google is holding an event to unveil the latest upgrades to its mobile device. Buy, sell, or hold the Google Pixel phone.
Gallagher: I'm going to sell that really quickly. In 2020, [laughs] it only sold 7.2 million Pixel smartphones in the whole year, compared to Apple in quarter 4 sold 80 million iPhones and Samsung sold 62 million phones. Of all of the Google businesses, it's definitely the least interesting to me. Google's done 232 acquisitions since 2004. I think I'd pick a lot of them over the invention of the Google Pixel smartphone.
Hill: Although, Jason, if we're thinking about the Pixel phone as a stock, the market share it has is so tiny. Maybe it's a value stock or a [laughs] really deep value stock.
Moser: Or perhaps a value trap, Chris. [laughs] I am a total sell on this one. I agree with Maria. To me, the numbers just don't really add it up. At 7.2 million phones in the context of 1.5 billion smartphones sold globally in 2019. Clearly, this is immaterial. It does make you wonder, why do they still do it? I don't know necessarily. It seems to me the more valuable part of the business is in the operating system. The Android operating system gives them so much opportunity. I respect and appreciate the effort in wanting to produce a phone, but to me, it seems odd that Google, Alphabet, whatever you want to call it, they haven't really nailed it. Like Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX) hasn't nailed it on the food side. Google hasn't nailed it on the hardware side. You've got to start wondering if it's even really worth their time. But if they're getting incremental share then that's incremental share and just depends on how much it costs for them to continue with these types of initiatives. But yes, absolutely a sell. You'll never see me making any calls or firing off any tweets from a Pixel phone.
Hill: Maria, before we move on, just real quick to Jason's point. I am genuinely surprised that we're in what year 5 or 6 of this experiment for a business that is so successful in so many other ways. It makes me wonder how much longer the Pixel phone has before they just shut it down because at some point, they either need to get much more significant market share. I don't know if they just decided to throw money at this and cut the price so that they can get it into more hands or they need to just shut it down. Are they still doing this in three years?
Gallagher: I think when you have as much money as Alphabet has and you have as much power as Alphabet has, you have a lot of things that are in motion at all times. They can't all be winners and I think at some point, you just have to either accept it or you just have this part of the company that's just trucking along and it's not doing great, but it's still around. I feel like it might be one of those where enough people use it, maybe there are enough people who work in that part of the business that are passionate about it. Maybe they just keep it going or maybe they shut it down. I think for them it's so immaterial that it could go either way pretty easily.
Hill: Jason, the day before Google's event, Apple is having its own event to unveil new product updates, even though Apple just had an event like this last month. Buy, sell, or hold the future of tech company events like these.
Moser: Well, I must admit when you gave me this question, the first thing that went through my mind was the Widespread Panic song ""Sell, Sell,"" because that's what I'm saying here, Chris, sell, sell. These events, I think, have jumped the shark personally. Now, I will say I understand why they're doing and I get it. It is obviously terrific marketing. It gives them a chance to control the narrative on whatever they are introducing. I do understand it, but it is so self-aggrandizing. To me it seems borderline narcissistic in some cases, the way they do these things. I much prefer just the under the radar or companies just keep on sneaking new innovations in front of us in changing the world without having necessarily to get into the spotlight and tell you how great they are because that's ultimately what these events feel like to me at this point. Perhaps they will reformat them or try a different way of distributing them. They can make them more creative and a little bit more enjoyable. But as it stands now, I want to watch these presentations less and less the more they announce them.
Hill: Yeah. Maria, it does seem like the more they do them, the less special they become. Do they need to go the route of just having like one in-person event per year and then just, I don't know, sending out videos otherwise. Are you like Jason, a hard sell on this one?
Gallagher: I'm going to go the opposite. I'm a buy, I think it's fine. I think I always like an event. I grew up my whole life doing theater, so I always loved the chance to see something dramatic happen. Especially the Apple ones, they always have the cool colors. I just think it's a fun way. I think it's smart to stoke excitement. I think it probably is useful for their marketing. They have a different vibe each time and you get people riled up, and then you get the excitement. I do think the more they do the less meaning may have, but I don't think I wonder when they've reached that point where they are now doing too many because I'm someone who I will still tune into a lot of them because I just think they are fun.
Hill: When is the car coming? Because like the rumored [laughs] Apple car seems like the product that is really ripe for a big event. If they are working on that, that's the event I want to see.
Moser: What do you think, Maria? I don't know anything about the car at this point.
Gallagher: I think it would be a very cool event. I would totally watch it. I think they have a really cool light show and they would drive it onto the stage. Or it would come up from the bottom at the stage with a fog machine.
Moser: I agree. I think a car could be a wow type of thing. Maybe that's it. It really needs to be something that focuses on something truly special. To me these things are just telling us about the next iteration of the MacBook or the iPad or the Watch or whatever it may be. It's just like whatever. Next. Give me something special and yeah, I'll be interested.
Hill: In 2014, CVS (NYSE: CVS) stopped selling tobacco products. This week Walgreens' (NASDAQ: WBA) CEO, Roz Brewer, said tobacco is ""under real scrutiny at her company right now."" Maria, buy, sell. or hold Walgreens quitting tobacco in the next six months.
Gallagher: I'm going to sell that idea just because it's so lucrative. I feel like realistically instead of completely stopping selling them, it'll be more like they'll add a label, add a different type of restriction. In 2019, they made it so only customers over the age of 21 could purchase slightly ahead of the federal guidelines changing. I think that even though they are trying to say that they are leaning more into their health and wellness-related merchandise. In 2017, 249 billion cigarettes were sold in the U.S. Even though it's decreasing it's such a lucrative business, I don't think that they're going to stop selling it completely, at least not in the next six months, maybe in the next couple of years. Do I want them to? I think that yes. Morally, I think that would be good, but I think it's just pretty lucrative business plan for them to completely cut it off.
Hill: Jason, you're buying this, selling, or holding?
Moser: Yeah. I'm going to take the other side of the coin here and buy. I think that you go back to the beginning of 2015, when CVS had phased out cigarettes from their stores. Now the stock hasn't really done all that well since then. That's a total return of around 4%. You look at Walgreen, it's interesting. It's even worse, down about 20%. I wouldn't attribute that performance necessarily getting rid of tobacco as much as just that's a difficult business. These are also two businesses that are evolving a bit, so to speak. Becoming more modern day healthcare companies and CVS with its acquisition of, what was it? Aetna. You see Walgreen going in that same direction as well. I think it's very difficult for a company to balance being a healthcare company while selling things that are clearly so detrimental to one's health. There is a blueprint out there for the way this has been done. Thanks to CVS. To me, it feels like this is a decision that's almost already been made. They're just trying to ease it out there as opposed to just being a headline that shows up in the news one day. To me, I think they will do it and I think long-term they won't suffer from it.
Hill: There is a blueprint that Walgreens can follow in terms of the way CVS did it, really pivoting and leaning into health. I will point out however, that that blueprint includes the fact that on the day CVS announced they were going to stop selling tobacco products, the stock fell 5%. Because to Maria's point, this is a lucrative part of the business. I think in CVS' case, it meant somewhere in the neighborhood of 2 billion dollars annually in terms of the front-of-store revenue. I think, Maria, it just comes down to, is Roz Brewer and her team at Walgreens willing to take that heat because they have to know it's coming. Don't they?
Gallagher: I think it is interesting to see as consumers get more and investors getting more invested in the idea of a company that does well and is not harming people with what they sell, I wonder how much they are taking that into account and trying to lean into maybe getting different types of investors into their stock or trying to make their company one that you can admire in that way, the way you do with some other companies like Costco (NASDAQ: COST) being an example of one. I think it will be interesting to see how much stake she puts in that and how much passion her and her team feel for that messaging and marketing.
Hill: Last month, the National Confectioners Association reported that retail sales of chocolate and candy, were more than 40% higher than last year, so Jason, buy, sell, or hold Halloween spending setting a record this year.
Moser: That's a strong buy, Chris and I'm helping the cause. [laughs] We have a standing rule here [laughs] in the Moser household, once Oct. 1 hits, we start buying the Halloween bags of candy, and that's just we have in our house, we are going to enjoy the entire month. Some people like to enjoy their birthday month, we like to enjoy each of the three holiday months, October, November, December, it's a great time of year. I think that honestly we're seeing folks are more and more feeling it's OK to get out there and do things like trick-or-treat or travel and whatnot. To me, I think there's going to be a little bit more enthusiasm behind this Halloween season and perhaps we've seen recently, and if I can help the cause at all, Chris, I certainly will. I have already got on the top and then we're going to go store later today and buy another bag of candy [laughs].
Hill: Maria.
Gallagher: I'm buying, I'm helping the cause, I have a lot of candy fun facts if anyone wants to hear them.
Hill: Lay them on me.
Gallagher: Americans purchase nearly 600 million pounds of candy a year for Halloween, 90 million pounds of chocolate candy is sold during Halloween week, which is more than Easter and Valentine's week, 10% of annual candy sales happen the days leading up to Halloween and the top-selling candy even though chocolate is more popular, the top-selling candy is actually candy corn, and there are 35 million pounds of candy corn produced each year, which is 9 billion pieces. [laughs] If the candy corn kernels [laughs] sold during Halloween were laid out end-to-end, they would circle the earth 4.5 times. Those are my candy facts.
Moser: Those are some very fun facts. Now that you mentioned it because we know Domino's benefits so greatly from Halloween, and that's one of their top five days of pizza sales, I wonder if you've laid each pizza out end-to-end, how many times that would go around the world?
Gallagher: I think that's an important thing we should probably try and figure out, as a team.
Hill: It would certainly taste better than the candy corn that's circling the globe, however many times.
Moser: Candy corn is very controversial item I'm coming to find. Through our shows and responses, that's a very controversial subject.
Hill: Let me just share this nugget in terms of retail spending, because the National Retail Federation believes that overall Halloween spending, so candy, but also costumes, decorations is going to set a record this year. It is going to be north of 10 billion dollars. One retail analyst said in response to that, ""The National Retail Federation may actually be underestimating willingness to spend. This means that the biggest risk to Halloween spending in 2021 is not consumer confidence at this point, it is continued supply chain disruptions and the availability of merchandise to meet consumer demand."" Jason, we've been talking about people needing to start their holiday shopping earlier this year. I usually do my candy shopping a few days before Halloween, based on this quote, maybe I need to get out there now.
Moser: I think you need to take a page from the JMo playbook and just start your candy shopping Oct. 1, [laughs] like you are really embracing the holiday. I think you're right. I think it's a good point we saw, you're just going back to those bank results. Bank of America, the deposit number, the 15% growth on the deposits, we're just at a point right now where consumers are still at a pretty good financial place, and credit cards are doing well. I think you're right. It's going to be less about the consumer's ability to spend. It's going to be more about just having stuff to actually spend it on.
Hill: Last thing before we go to the break, Maria, I'm sorry to put you on the spot, but we are talking about supply chain disruptions. It's a big theme this year, certainly over the last few weeks on this show, with so many companies talking about it. During our production meeting this morning, you mentioned that you have a Halloween customer idea that's built around that theme and I'd love it if you could share with the dozens of listeners.
Gallagher: Well, listeners, if you decide to do this as well, let me now, but I decided that I want to be the boat that blocked the Suez Canal for Halloween. [laughs] Then, I think it would be very funny to block everyone when they're trying to go places and just say, I'm sorry, I'm stuck, and I think that would be really funny. I don't know if I'm going to actually do it, but it's my idea.
Moser: It's a strong buy. It's a strong, high-conviction buy, I love that idea.
Gallagher: Thank you. [MUSIC]
Hill: Radar stocks coming up after the break, so stay right here. You're listening to Motley Fool Money. [MUSIC] As always, people on the program may have interest in the stocks they talk about on The Motley Fool, may have formal recommendations for or against, so don't buy or sell stocks based solely on what you hear. Welcome back to Motley Fool Money. Chris Hill here with Maria Gallagher and Jason Moser. Time to get to the stocks on our radar, our man behind the glass, Dan Boyd is going to hit you with a question, but first, Dan, we were talking earlier in the show about the upcoming promotion from Popeyes the partnership with Megan Thee Stallion. You're someone who does a decent amount of boots-on-the-ground research at Popeyes. I'm curious, are you excited about this new partnership?
Dan Boyd: There is never not a moment in my life, Chris, where I am not excited for Popeyes. The idea that [laughs] I could get Popeyes will bring me out of depression, it will get me up in the morning. I am always ready for some Louisiana fried chicken.
Hill: Are you going to get the new sauce?
Boyd: I'll try it. Yeah, I love Megan Thee Stallion, I think she's great, I think her songs are great and anything they can do to shake-up that menu up there, I'm always here for.
Hill: Let's get through some radar stocks. Jason Moser, you're up first, what are you looking at this week?
Moser: Yeah, just taking a closer look at Marvell, ticker MRVL, the recent investor day, the term 5G was mentioned 34 times and I really do feel like this is an excellent way to play that 5G movement, a pure-play 5G idea. The growth is really being driven by three key markets for the business, cloud, 5G, and automotive. All three growing better than 20% annually represent a tremendous opportunity for the business. You remember they had a recent acquisition of Inphi, which was the company I had recommended a little while back. I think that will provide some nice tailwinds and they have another acquisition of smaller one of Inovium, and that will give them additional networking solutions for cloud and edge data centers. Ultimately, that's what this business has done thanks to CEO Matt Murphy. They've had this vision to transform Marvell from a consumer-oriented business to an infrastructure-oriented company, and this vision is starting to bear fruit, so I think at around 45 or so times full-year fiscal estimates right now, to me, it seems like a very reasonable price in a market where a lot of valuation seem maybe a bit frothy [laughs].
Hill: Dan, question about Marvell?
Boyd: I can't think about Marvell without thinking about Marvel obviously. Jason, I have a speculative question for you, how many semiconductors are used in the production of a Marvel movie?
Moser: Business cards have thousands, I'd have to believe there will be hundreds of thousands of chips involved with the production of something like that. But that's just a wag as we call it in the business, a wild you-know-what guess.
Boyd: Thanks, Jason.
Hill: Maria Gallagher, what are you looking at this week?
Maria Gallagher: I have reached the age where all my free time is spent looking at homes I can't afford on Zillow, I mean, looking at these estimates. I'm going to spend a little bit more time looking at Zillow Group and trying to understand the dynamics of their iBuying business, I think is really fascinating. Them buying your house then flipping it, and understanding the margins of that and the risks associated with that as well. I think those trends will be really interesting to watch.
Hill: The ticker symbol?
Gallagher: ZG.
Hill: Dan, question about Zillow Group?
Boyd: I am a Zillow shareholder, which is great because it's rare on this show when I actually get to be that for radar stocks. But I bought a house in 2019, and so what I do Maria, is I am glued to the Zillow estimate of my house, whereas I'm not looking for a new house because I can't afford two houses, but when Zillow tells me how much they think my house is worth, I get very excited [laughs].
Gallagher: You sound like my mom. She likes to email my sister links to Zillow estimates for apartments near her to convince her to move to my mom's building. [MUSIC]
Hill: What do you want to add to your watch list, Dan?
Boyd: Like I said, I already have Zillow here in my portfolio, so I'm going to go with Marvell.
Hill: Jason Moser, Maria Gallagher, thanks so much for being here.
Gallagher: Thanks for having us.
Hill: That's going to do it for this week show, we'll see you in next week.

This video was recorded on Oct. 11, 2021.
Chris Hill: It's Monday, October 11th. Welcome to Market Foolery. I'm Chris Hill. Joining me today, the name's Moser. Jason Moser.
Jason Moser: [laughs] Oh, man.
Chris Hill: Thanks for being here.
Jason Moser: That was well done. I mean, it will make more sense as we go on here, but I like that. That was very, very good.
Chris Hill: Yeah, we're going to get to James Bond and how James Bond did over the weekend, and we're also going to get to the big banks that are kicking off earnings season later in the week. But first, we're going to talk about Southwest Airlines (NYSE: LUV) because shares are down a bit today after they canceled nearly 2,000 flights over the weekend. Southwest blamed it on a combination of bad weather, air traffic control issues, and staffing problems. Although I will point out, other airlines have to deal with bad weather and air traffic control [laughs] and other airlines weren't canceling nearly 2,000 flights this weekend. We talked the other day on Motley Fool Money about hiring being an issue that's probably going to come up this earnings season on a lot of conference calls. You look at the storage and it really seems like Southwest is dealing with more than just hiring issues. They're dealing with staff issues.
Jason Moser: Yeah, I think you're right. To your point, that is a big spade of cancellations. It's about 24 percent of their overall flight operations. That is a very significant situation. Honestly, a little bit surprised that the stock wasn't under a little bit more pressure from this, but perhaps investors are willing to take a bit of a bigger picture view here. It's interesting to read about why people think this happened. There's the side of folks that say, ""Well, that's what you get when you mandate vaccines,"" and then other sides say, well, it has something to do with the actual airline itself and it's a horrible jobs environment. Why are they having trouble staffing? I think it's a combination of, first thing, throughout the pandemic, Southwest has been making investments, has been making efforts to spread its wings, so to speak, gain market share, play a little bit of offense. Like I've talked about before with Darden Restaurants. They saw weakness in the restaurant space throughout this stretch of time and thought, ""Well, we're in a position where we have the balance sheet and the ability, we can try to capture more of this market share, spend some money upfront really in the name of capturing more market share,"" and it may drag results a little bit in the near term. But longer term, it's a bigger picture, it's the right thing to do. Southwest during this pandemic, clearly air travel has been one of the most impacted markets, and Southwest has invested. They played a little bit of offense to expand their routes, to expand their services. I think that's the right thing to do, honestly.
With airlines, really, if you want to grow, you have to offer more routes and more flights. But what they did in the process of this is they started spreading themselves very thin. I think what this really does is it shines a light on air travel and shows how really difficult running an airline could be. It is one of the more complex logistical equations that you constantly have to try to figure out. Just go to the airport and you see the arrivals and departures, and it's just an amalgam of how the world do they make all of this stuff work. It is not just on the airlines themselves, you've got air traffic control to deal with and whatnot. There are clearly some air traffic control issues in Florida and there were some weather issues. That's not a made-up excuse, that is real. I think part of the staffing issue really more relates to Southwest's efforts to grow its adding of routes and services. They just spread themselves a little bit too thin, and then they got hit by a few external factors there that really made it a very, very difficult logistics problem, probably one that they really couldn't fully solve, and that's what resulted in having to cancel all of these flights. The good news I think is it's something that will pass, but they absolutely need to make sure that they are staffed up appropriately for this growing business, if they want to maintain that customer service reputation that they've been able to foster up at this point.
Chris Hill: I'm glad you mentioned the Darden example because I think this is something that we see a lot more often in restaurants and in retail, where typically at the end of a fiscal year, restaurant chains, major retailers will talk about their footprint and how many new locations are going to be opening and are they closing ones and all that sort of thing. I know that I have made the comment over the past decade at various points in time about a given retailer or given restaurant chain when they come out and say, ""This is how many locations we're planning to open in the next year,"" and my comment at different points in time has been, ""That doesn't seem like a lot. Why aren't they aiming higher?"" To your point, it's like you want to grow smartly. You want to make sure you're not overextending yourself. It's not the sort of thing where you can just snap your fingers and throw up a new restaurant and hire a bunch of people to staff it accordingly. As you said, it might have been that Southwest got a little bit over their skis. But this is definitely something that bears watching. As we head into earnings season, it will be interesting to see if other airlines get questions about what's happening with Southwest and any comments they make.
Jason Moser: Yeah. Particularly as you watch the rest of this year play out, we're seeing all sorts of signs. I think we're just going to see more and more people traveling. We're at a point now where, we were talking about this with Delta I think last week, there's more and more people I think are feeling more and more comfortable getting out there and then feeling like maybe the ""risk"" is not as great because we have all of these tools. You're going to see I think traffic continue to pick up. Southwest, that's a nice thing. You're an airline, you want the demand, but you have to be able to satisfy that demand. There are a lot of airlines out there and a lot of bigger airlines that seemingly didn't have to deal with the same problem that Southwest had to deal with. They will want to make sure they don't let this persist. This is something where if you continue to see, well, they had to cancel more flights, and like you said, they're a little bit ahead of their skis. That could have some longer lasting implications on the stock price. Perhaps the growth prospects don't seem as attractive as they once were.
Chris Hill: The 25th film in the James Bond franchise opened in the US and Canada over the weekend. No Time To Die took in $56 million at the box office, putting it just over $300 million worldwide. This is an MGM film, but you read the coverage of this and it's clear, it wasn't just MGM that was rooting for the success. This is one of those tent-pole movies in the same way that the Top Gun sequel, the next Marvel movie. These are films that are designed to get people in the theater. It's hard to look at this as anything other than at least a little bit disappointing. They were really hoping for more. When I say they, I mean literally everyone in Hollywood.
Jason Moser: [laughs] Yeah, I guess. I feel like apparently MGM's expectations just landed squarely within their expectations. Now, hopefully they were going in there with more of a conservative take because it does feel like that's still a pretty light number. That's probably for a few reasons. We were talking about this earlier. For me, at least, it feels like maybe the James Bond franchise, I don't know if it's gotten stale or if it's maybe not resonating with as many folks, maybe that's just not it at all. I still enjoy it, but I definitely don't get the same out of it as I did in my younger days. I do wonder, too, given the timing of all of this, given where we are right now, we've got a ton going on in the sports world, the weather is terrific, I just wonder how many people really feel like, well, all of the options I have, maybe right now going to a movie theater just isn't at the top of the list. I can certainly see that. I'm sure a lot of people are enjoying this last bit of good weather before fall and winter really kick in. Maybe there's a little bit of a tiny thing there, but I think clearly we're not fully past COVID concerns to where the masses feel like going back to the movie theaters, and that's going to be a problem. But it is encouraging to see such good global results.
Chris Hill: The global results are good. I think you're onto something. You look at the data regarding the age of the people who are going to the theater for this film, more than half of them are over the age of 35, and it's the 18-34 year-old audience that really drives those tent-pole movies. I think your line of thinking regarding the James Bond franchise and who it appeals to, it's less younger people, it's more older people, and that data was born out over the weekend. I think you're right. I saw a stat this morning that the ratings for NFL football are the highest they've been in six years. We got the baseball playoffs going on. So this could be a little bit more of a long tail. Whereas there are other movies, the opening weekend they do well, and then there's a huge drop-off. I could see this film putting up decent numbers for a few weeks here. The last thing before we move on to the big banks is, it's another thing you and I were talking about earlier, nobody's really figured it out yet in terms of balancing the streaming versus the box office. You had made the point I guess this coming weekend, the next, I don't know, is that the 43rd movie in the Halloween [laughs] franchise? Maybe it just seems, though.
Jason Moser: It feels like it's up there.
Chris Hill: But that movie is going to be released in theaters, but it's also going to be released on the Peacock streaming service. Maybe that's just another test for the people who made the movie, but I don't know. I'm a little surprised that we're at the far end of the pandemic and nobody is still really sure how to balance theatrical with streaming yet.
Jason Moser: Yeah. Absolutely, the thoughts on the matter are all over the place. You've got however many days you feel like something should be exclusive to a theater before it can go into on-demand versus you've got Comcast, which owns Peacock and also owns Universal. Well, Universal is the studio responsible for Halloween. Clearly, Comcast is calling the shots here. They can just say, ""Well, we want this thing to go in the theaters, but we also want it to go on to Peacock."" I did check. It was interesting the Halloween thing, it's going to go on Peacock. It's going to be available for Peacock subscribers for no extra charge. Now, Peacock is a tiered subscription. So you have just that overall free, then you've got the five dollar ad supported, and then the $10 no ads. That makes the experience watching a new movie like that when you know that commercials are coming up. I mean, that stinks. [laughs] I don't think anybody really likes that. Now, the interesting thing is though, I've said this before, convenience is just super addictive. I mean, I don't think people really think about how addictive it is because we've become so used to it. Everything these days is built on convenience for the consumer. Amazon really got this ball rolling, but now anything that you want is just available at the click of a button on your phone. So for a lot of people, maybe it's a less than optimal viewing experience. But for the convenience of it all, maybe it's something that you are willing to forego and say, well, you know what? I'm going to go and pass on the theater just because this is so easy I'm still at the end of the day going to be able to see the movie. But yeah, I think it is dependent on the studio's putting out the movies and their relationship with the theaters, and then also their relationship with the streamers because they all have to figure out a way to play nice. But it sure feels like the theaters are the ones that they are moving closer and closer to the bottom of the pecking order here, it feels like, and I don't know that that changes. It's not to say that theaters are going away, but maybe when we're looking for large and growing market opportunities, maybe the movie theater experience just isn't that large and growing market opportunity. Maybe it's just a market opportunity that's going to become more localized toward the demand for that type of experience is.
Chris Hill: Well, it's Hollywood, so I'm sure everyone is absolutely going to get along and play nice with each other.
Jason Moser: [laughs] Of course.
Chris Hill: Earnings season kicks off later this week with the big banks. I know you and Matt Frankel are going to be talking about this on today's episode of Industry Focus. What are a couple of things you guys are going to be looking forward this season?
Jason Moser: Yeah, it's a big week. Earnings really going to full force for us on Wednesday when JPMorgan announces, then you've got Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Citigroup on Thursday. We've got Goldman Sachs. I was going to say Golden Slacks. That's like on my favorite little nicknames [inaudible 00:15:07] [laughs] I'll never forget it, Golden Slacks. [laughs] Goldman Sachs on Friday. Some of the things we're looking at going forward as things start to normalize a little bit more, deposits have been through the roof clearly because of all the stimulus. It's going to be interesting to see as that starts to abate if loan activity starts to pick back up. With interest rates starting to tick back up, that loan activity could be a good thing and result in some boosts to that net interest income number that has been suppressed for so long for these banks. Does feel like given the state of the consumer today and the status of all those deposit accounts are only the credit card businesses have been doing very well. Charge-offs are down significantly, particularly for credit card, heavy companies like Citigroup. You look at the way these banks perform to date, of all of those five, year-to-date, they're all outperforming the market, but Wells Fargo is clearly leading the way there with 60 percent gain. I think that's for a number of reasons, but they're really coming off of a low base and it was just a question of whether that is a value trap or a value play. It's starting to look like a value play. It's starting to look like it's worked out pretty well. Getting a better idea of where Wells Fargo stands with regulators is going to be something worth noting. One thing I did. You know I love to serve conference calls for terminology, words and terms and phrases. I went through these five banks earnings transcripts earlier today and searched the word inflation because I feel like inflation is a word we're hearing more and more these days. As it pertains to banks, that's a big deal, particularly these big banks because they have such a meaningful position on our economy. Last quarter, the word inflation was mentioned three times in Goldman Sachs call, two times in Citigroup's, zero times in Wells Fargo's, one time in Bank of America, but 14 times in JPMorgan's, which I just found fascinating, that discrepancy there, the disparity, the difference between those. Why so much more in JPMorgan? I think that's for a couple of reasons. I think it's because JPMorgan probably plays a greater role in more of our economy and more of our financial lives, even if you don't necessarily know it. Then also I think Jamie Dimon tends to take a bigger picture view of things as opposed to perhaps something like a Wells Fargo which is very focused right now on turning the business around and regulators and whatnot. I think these banks are in a pretty good position coming off of an underperforming year last year. They're performing very well this year, and it seems like we're going to get some good information in learning the state of the economy and how they're viewing the holiday season coming up here, too.

Technology has been evolving at a frantic pace over the past few years. Ideas such as augmented reality, autonomous driving, and even commercial space travel are now a reality. That said, something like 5G technology is something most consumers can relate to. Hence, 5G stocks are among the most discussed topics among stock market investors this year. Recently, QUALCOMM’s (NASDAQ: QCOM) CEO highlighted the potential of combining edge computing and 5G devices connected to the cloud to bring new capabilities to various industries. By delivering real-time data and border contextual information, we could be seeing radical changes like never before.
In addition, Dell Technologies (NYSE: DELL) also aims to push deeper into the 5G space by releasing new software. The company is leveraging the Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) that lets telecommunication carriers use software to run network functions on standardized computing hardware. This means that carriers may not need to purchase certain specialized equipment for 5G. Could this be a game-changer for 5G technology in the long run? Well, only time will tell. That said, it has drawn interest even from the U.S. government. We can all agree that everyone looks forward to the day 5G becomes accessible to everyone. With that in mind, here are 4 top 5G stocks that you could capitalize on in the stock market today. 
Best 5G Stocks To Buy [Or Sell] Now
Marvell Technology Inc (NASDAQ: MRVL)
American Tower Corp (NYSE: AMT)
Verizon Communications Inc (NYSE: VZ)
AT&T Inc. (NYSE: T)
Marvell Technology 
First, we will be looking at Marvell Technology. The data infrastructure semiconductor provider plays an important role in rolling out 5G. The company helps telecom carriers deploy 5G networks across the world. It supplies chips to the likes of Nokia (NYSE: NOK) and Samsung. MRVL stock has been on a bullish run this year, rising more than 35% since the start of the year.
On Tuesday, the company announced that its Prestera Ethernet switch platforms incorporating Dent are being deployed by enterprise customers worldwide. This enables a new era of autonomous networking. With these deployments in place, the company is helping to accelerate the build-out of Ethernet switching infrastructure in emerging applications, such as autonomous retail. Therefore, retailers can transform physical stores into smart retail-connected environments.
On top of that, Marvell has also finally completed its acquisition of Innovium. The acquisition complements the company by extending Marvell’s leadership in the cloud. Also, it would allow Marvell to immediately participate in the fastest-growing segment of the switch market with a cloud-optimized solution. Given these developments, would you invest in MRVL stock now?

American Tower 
Following that, we have American Tower on the list. Essentially, it is a holding company that operates as a real estate investment trust (REIT). The company owns, operates, and develops multitenant communications real estate. Its portfolio has more than 214,000 communication sites, including more than 43,000 properties in the U.S. and Canada. 
The company has its hands in the 5G industry by providing its vast network of towers. American Tower claims to have the largest portfolio of broadcast towers in the U.S. Its shared wireless infrastructure solutions serve as the foundation for tomorrow’s 5G, Internet of Things (IoT), and NEXTGEN TV technologies. The company would stand to benefit long-term as 5G technology continues to grow.
Now that the company will be reporting its third-quarter earnings on October 28, let us take this opportunity to review its previous performance. During its second quarter, its revenue increased 20.2% to $2.29 billion. Meanwhile, its net income skyrocketed by 66.8% to $748 million. So, do you think American Towers will be able to maintain its growth trajectory? If so, would you invest in AMT stock ahead of its earnings report?

Verizon Communication 
Another top 5G company today would be Verizon. This is a company that provides communications, information, and entertainment products and services. Most would be familiar with its wireless services that are provided across the U.S. under the Verizon brand. Lately, the company has been pushing hard in the 5G space to bring better services to its customers.
For instance, you can now access Verizon’s 5G wherever you are, whether you’re at home, at work, or on the go. Its 5G Home Internet is now available in 60 cities, 5G Ultra Wideband mobility in nearly 90 cities, and 5G Business Internet has expanded to 57 cities. Moreover, its Verizon Business unlimited plans give you the option for a mobile hotspot for as low as $30 a line. When it comes to 5G, connectivity and speed are of utmost importance for most consumers and Verizon has gotten that covered. 
It is also noteworthy that the company and CareAR have announced a strategic partnership earlier this month. The partnership aims to transform the service and customer experience CareAR delivers. Technicians will be able to remotely and proactively resolve service issues faster, smarter, and more safely with Verizon’s 4G and 5G networks on board. Overall, the company appears to be firing on all cylinders in the 5G space. With that in mind, do you think VZ stock is an attractive stock to buy?

AT&T
Similar to Verizon, AT&T is a holding company that provides telecommunications, media, and technology services globally. However, it also has a WarnerMedia segment that develops, produces, and distributes feature films, television, gaming, and other content. While it may be true that T stock has been under pressure in recent months, there are reasons to believe it could potentially make a turnaround soon.
For starters, the company partnered with Frontier Communications last week to bring fiber-optic connectivity to large enterprise customers outside AT&T’s current footprint. Hence, it will be able to reach out to large enterprise customers in markets where it does not own a fiber network. The agreement will also benefit AT&T as it will support the deployment of its 5G mobility network. 
Not to mention, AT&T has recently selected Ericsson (NASDAQ: ERIC) to help build its 5G network in the U.S. The deal helps support the deployment of the service provider’s recently acquired C-band spectrum and the launch of 5G Standalone. This is significant as it will help AT&T to bring its 5G network to more consumers, businesses, and first responders across key industries. All things considered, could T stock be a viable investment at its current price?

BRUSSELS, Oct 12 (Reuters) - Nvidia's NVDA.O $54 billion bid for British chip designer ARM is expected to face an extended EU antitrust investigation after concessions offered last week failed to address competition concerns, three people familiar with the matter said.
An EU investigation would be the second setback for Nvidia coming two months after Britain's antitrust agency warned that the deal for the country's most important technology company could damage competition and weaken rivals.
The European Commission is scheduled to end its preliminary review on Oct. 27 and a four-month investigation into the deal would now follow, the people told Reuters said.
A spokesperson for the Commission declined to comment.
""The regulatory process is confidential. The transaction will help to transform Arm and boost competition and innovation, including in the UK,"" Nvidia Corp, a U.S. technology firm headquartered in Silicon Valley, said.
The world's biggest maker of graphics and artificial intelligence (AI) chips has offered ""behavioural remedies"" to the Commission, the people said, without providing details.
Such remedies usually refer to pledges by companies to take measures aimed at preserving competition.
Nvidia has said it would maintain ARM as a neutral technology supplier in a bid to allay concerns from customers such as Qualcomm Inc QCOM.O, Samsung Electronics Co Ltd 005930.KS and Apple Inc AAPL.O.
The EU competition enforcer has not sought feedback from rivals and customers on the concessions, indicating that they were not sufficient, the people said.
Backers of the deal include ARM customers Broadcom AVGO.O, MediaTek 2454.TW and Marvell MRVL.O.

Additionally, Marvell, a semiconductor technology company, has seen its stock gain almost 8% over the last month, rising from around $60. The company’s recent Q2 2022 earnings (Marvell’s fiscal year ends in January) reported in late August saw revenue rise from $727 million in Q2 ’21 to $1.08 billion in Q2 ’22. However, a jump across all expense heads, saw operating loss expand from $151 million to $267 million, with EPS dropping from -$0.24 in Q2 ’21 to -$0.34 in Q2 ’22.
Now, after the recent rally, will Marvell stock continue its upward trajectory over the coming weeks, or is a correction in the stock more likely? According to the Trefis Machine Learning Engine, which identifies trends in the company’s stock price using ten years of historical data, returns for Marvell stock average 3.3% (implying an increase in stock price from $65 to $67) in the next one-month (twenty-one trading days) period after experiencing an 8% rise over the previous week (five trading days).

You can test the answer and many other combinations on the Trefis Machine Learning Engine to test Marvell Technology stock price forecast after a rise or fall. You can test the chance of recovery over different time intervals of a quarter, month, or even just 1 day.

MACHINE LEARNING ENGINE – try it yourself:
If Marvell Technology stock moved by -5% over five trading days, THEN over the next twenty-one trading days Marvell Technology stock moves an average of 2.5%, with an average 57.3% probability of a positive return over this period.
Also, given a -5% movement for the stock over five trading days, it has historically witnessed an excess return of 1.7% compared to the S&P500 over the next 21 trading days, with an average 54% probability of a positive excess return.
Some Fun Scenarios, FAQs & Making Sense of Marvell Stock Movements:
Question 1: Is the price forecast for Marvell stock higher after a drop?
Answer: Consider two situations,
Case 1: Marvell stock drops by 5% or more in a week
Case 2: Marvell stock rises by 5% or more in a week
Is the average return for Marvell stock higher over the subsequent month after Case 1 or Case 2?
Marvell stock fares better after Case 1, with an expected return of 4.7% over the next month (21 trading days) under Case 1 (where the stock has just suffered a 5% loss over the previous week), versus, an expected return of 2.3% for Case 2. This implies a price forecast of $68.18 in Case 1 and a figure of $66.67 in Case 2 using Marvell market price of $65.15 on 10/8/2021.
In comparison, the S&P 500 has an expected return of 3.1% over the next 21 trading days under Case 1, and an average return of just 0.5% for Case 2 as detailed in our dashboard that details the expected return for the S&P 500 after a fall or rise.
Try the Trefis machine learning engine above to see for yourself how Marvell stock is likely to behave after any specific gain or loss over a period.
Question 2: Does patience pay?
Answer: If you buy and hold Marvell stock, the expectation is over time the near-term fluctuations will cancel out, and the long-term positive trend will favor you – at least if the company is otherwise strong.
Overall, according to data and Trefis machine learning engine’s calculations, patience absolutely pays for most stocks!
For Marvell stock, the returns over the next N days after a -5% change over the last five trading days is detailed in the table below, along with the returns for the S&P500:
You can try the engine to see what this table looks like for Marvell after a larger loss over the last week, month, or quarter.
Question 3: What about the stock price forecast after a rise if you wait for a while?
Answer:  The expected return after a rise is understandably lower than after a drop as detailed in the previous question. Interestingly, though, if a stock has gained over the last few days, you would do better to avoid short-term bets for most stocks.

2021-10-11 00:00:00+00:00,Why Subaru Could Be Poised for a Rebound After the Chip Shortage,MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-subaru-could-be-poised-for-a-rebound-after-the-chip-shortage-2021-10-11,,,"The entire automotive sector is struggling in the grip of the great 2021 chip shortage, and Subaru (OTC: FUJHY), which just reported its September sales results, is no exception. Sales plummeted 30% year over year last month.
But one significant fact mentioned in its latest report could be the key to an even stronger-than-expected rebound once the chip shortage eases. Customer response to its new Wilderness models is very positive, and that matches up well with current consumer trends.
Image source: Getty Images.
How Subaru is performing to date
Subaru's automobile deliveries since June give a snapshot of the chip shortage's effects. In June, the shortage was starting to affect inventory, with a 20.35% sales drop year over year. But reported sales for the second quarter provided at the same time still showed a 20.3% rise from a year ago, with the shortage's full impact just beginning.
A July respite followed, with only a 2.6% sales decline. The Outback sold the largest number of vehicles, with sales increasing 15.6% year over year to 14,058 units, while the Crosstrek came close with a 50.4% surge to 13,402. The senior vice president for sales of Subaru of America, Jeff Walters, said ""buyers continue to show excitement for our standout SUV lineup, with the Crosstrek, Outback, and Forester continuing to perform well.""
August saw units sold slump by 15%, with the Forester and Outback losing ground and only the Crosstrek among the company's SUVs still showing a year-over-year increase.
And in September's report, sales plunged 30% year over year. The drop might be exaggerated, however, because September 2020 saw an all-time record for unit sales. On the positive side, Subaru's sales for the first nine months of 2021 are still 6% higher overall than during the same period in 2020. Demand is clearly growing strongly, and it is only the lack of inventory, not a failure of consumer interest, causing the decline year over year in monthly deliveries.
A big potential boost for the company's future sales
The chip shortage is slamming the brakes on Subaru's sales for now. Uncertainty about the shortage's duration is high, and even chip industry figures provide vastly different estimates on when matters will improve. CNBC reports that the CEO of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD), Lisa Su, predicted at a conference that chip supply will remain ""tight"" through 2022's first half, but then ease.
She based this on the fact chipmakers started building new factory capacity a year ago, and a typical factory takes around a year and a half from breaking ground to become operational, though two years is also possible. On the pessimistic side, CEO Matt Murphy of Marvell Technology (NASDAQ: MRVL) thinks there ""is going to be a very painful period, including in 2022 for the duration of the year,"" and more capacity won't be available until 2023 or 2024.

Once conditions improve, though, a significant opportunity awaits Subaru, assuming current consumer trends continue. It's already positioned for this prospective sales surge. As noted in the monthly sales described above, demand for Subaru's SUV models, the Forester, the Outback, and the Crosstrek, is already high. Importantly, Walters highlighted in the September sales report how Subaru has just introduced the new Outback Wilderness and Forester Wilderness, which ""continue to impress car buyers looking for enhanced off-road capabilities and trail-tested confidence.""
These sales indications and product launches mesh perfectly with the ongoing surge in Americans' interest in outdoor activities. The pandemic's early months saw closures, lockdowns, and social distancing make most usual entertainment venues inaccessible, sparking an American exodus to the great outdoors. Multiple sectors are benefiting, including golf equipment suppliers; outdoor clothing brands; and sellers of mowers, tillers, and lawn tractors. Most visibly, recreational vehicle manufacturers like Thor Industries (NYSE: THO) are selling record numbers of RVs, many of them high-end and high margin, to a growing swarm of campers.
As the bellwether of outdoor vehicle and equipment sales, the RV industry is indicating the outdoor craze is likely to extend through 2022, at a minimum. The RV Industry Association forecasts at least 600,000 units sold in 2022, higher than 2021's record-setting sales, and perhaps even more than 614,000 units at the high estimate. This figure takes chip shortages into account and would probably be higher without them. The new interest in the outdoors isn't likely to go away.
With demand for its SUV line already strong, the new Wilderness variants of its Forester and Outback with enhanced off-road capabilities just rolling out, and a dynamic outdoor and off-roading consumer trend in full swing, Subaru has all the makings of a sales surge lined up. All that's needed is an easing of the chip shortage, and the company is likely not only to rebound but also to rocket to new highs. Everything is pointing to the company being one of the more bullish automotive stocks once the chip recovery begins.

(NASDAQ:MRVL) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. Insiders often own a large chunk of younger, smaller, companies while huge companies tend to have institutions as shareholders. Companies that have been privatized tend to have low insider ownership.
Marvell Technology is a pretty big company. It has a market capitalization of US$54b. Normally institutions would own a significant portion of a company this size. Taking a look at our data on the ownership groups (below), it seems that institutional investors have bought into the company. Let's delve deeper into each type of owner, to discover more about Marvell Technology.
NasdaqGS:MRVL Ownership Breakdown October 8th 2021
What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Marvell Technology?
Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.
We can see that Marvell Technology does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Marvell Technology's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.
NasdaqGS:MRVL Earnings and Revenue Growth October 8th 2021
Since institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Marvell Technology. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is FMR LLC with 14% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 8.8% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 8.4% by the third-largest shareholder.
A closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 11 shareholders have a combined ownership of 51% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.
While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.
Insider Ownership Of Marvell Technology
The definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.
Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.
Our information suggests that Marvell Technology, Inc. insiders own under 1% of the company. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$273m worth of shares (at current prices). In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to see if those insiders have been buying or selling.
General Public Ownership
The general public holds a 12% stake in Marvell Technology. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.

BRUSSELS, Oct 6 (Reuters) - Nvidia NVDA.O has offered concessions in a bid to secure EU antitrust approval for its $54 billion acquisition of British chip designer Arm, a European Commission filing showed on Wednesday.
The deal announced by world's biggest maker of graphics and AI chips last year has sparked concerns in the semiconductor industry over whether Arm could remain a neutral player licensing intellectual property to customers and rivals.
The EU competition enforcer, which did not provide details of the concessions in line with its policy, set an Oct. 27 deadline for its decision.
It will now seek feedback from rivals and customers before deciding whether to accept the concessions, demand more or open a four-month long investigation.
Nvidia has said it would maintain Arm as a neutral technology supplier as it aims to allay concerns from customers such as Qualcomm Inc QCOM.O, Samsung Electronics Co Ltd 005930.KS and Apple Inc AAPL.O.
Arm customers Broadcom AVGO.O, MediaTek 2454.TW and Marvell MRVL.O are supporters of the deal.
Arm, owned by Japan's SoftBank Group Corp 9984.T, is a major player in global semiconductors. Its designs power nearly every smartphone and millions of other devices.

Therefore, a good first due diligence step in forming an expectation of annual yield going forward, is looking at the history above, for a sense of stability over time. This can help in judging whether the most recent dividends from these companies are likely to continue. If they do continue, the current estimated yields on annualized basis would be 7.64% for AT&T Inc, 2.23% for NetApp, Inc., and 0.41% for Marvell Technology Inc.

2021-10-04 00:00:00+00:00,Analysts See 14% Gains Ahead For EUSA,MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/analysts-see-14-gains-ahead-for-eusa-2021-10-04,,,"Looking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at ETF Channel, we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. For the iShares MSCI USA Equal Weighted ETF (Symbol: EUSA), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $96.06 per unit.
With EUSA trading at a recent price near $84.61 per unit, that means that analysts see 13.53% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of EUSA's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are Lear Corp. (Symbol: LEA), Marvell Technology Inc (Symbol: MRVL), and lululemon athletica inc (Symbol: LULU). Although LEA has traded at a recent price of $159.14/share, the average analyst target is 19.68% higher at $190.45/share. Similarly, MRVL has 13.91% upside from the recent share price of $59.83 if the average analyst target price of $68.15/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting LULU to reach a target price of $457.00/share, which is 13.86% above the recent price of $401.37. Below is a twelve month price history chart comparing the stock performance of LEA, MRVL, and LULU:
Below is a summary table of the current analyst target prices discussed above:
NAME SYMBOL RECENT PRICE AVG. ANALYST 12-MO. TARGET % UPSIDE TO TARGET
iShares MSCI USA Equal Weighted ETF EUSA $84.61 $96.06 13.53%
Lear Corp. LEA $159.14 $190.45 19.68%
Marvell Technology Inc MRVL $59.83 $68.15 13.91%
lululemon athletica inc LULU $401.37 $457.00 13.86%
Are analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past. These are questions that require further investor research.
