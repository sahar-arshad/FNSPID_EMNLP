WASHINGTON, July 27 (Reuters) - A bipartisan Congressional panel blasted U.S.-based corporate sponsors of the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics on Tuesday, including Coca-Cola, Visa Inc. and Airbnb, accusing them of putting profits ahead of accusations of genocide in China.
Republican Congressman Chris Smith told the Congressional-Executive Commission on China hearing that the sponsors needed to reconcile their ""ostensible commitment to human rights"" with subsidizing an Olympics where the host country is ""actively committing human rights abuses"".
Smith asked each of the executives at the hearing - from Airbnb ABNB.O, Coca-Cola KO.N, Intel INTC.O, Visa Inc V.N and Procter & Gamble PG.N - whether the games should be relocated or postponed due to concerns over human rights violations. All of them declined to opine, or said they had no responsibility over site selection.
""We do not make decisions on these host locations. We support and follow the athletes wherever they compete,"" Coca-Cola's global vice president for human rights Paul Lalli said.
When asked about the U.S. government determination that China was committing a genocide against Uyghurs and other Muslims minority groups, only Steve Rodgers, executive vice president and general counsel for Intel, said he believed it.
""I've read the State Department report. I've studied it, and I believe its conclusions,"" Rodgers said, drawing praise from Republican Senator Tom Cotton for his ""straight answer.""
Other executives said they respected the U.S. government's conclusions, but would not weigh in on the matter.
The executives represent the five U.S. companies that have sponsorship commitments running through the Beijing Games under the official Olympic Partner (TOP) Program.
Rights groups, researchers, former residents and some Western lawmakers and officials say Chinese authorities have facilitated forced labor by detaining around a million Uyghurs and other primarily Muslim minorities in camps since 2016.
President Joe Biden's administration agreed with a determination by the former Trump administration that the detention camps and other abuses amounted to genocide.
China denies wrongdoing, saying it has set up vocational training centers to combat extremism. The Chinese Embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.
""Obviously, every one of you, with the exception on occasion of Mr. Rodgers, was sent here with orders not to say anything that could offend the Chinese Communist Party,"" Cotton said, calling testimony at the hearing ""pathetic and disgraceful"".
Democratic Representative Tom Malinowski rebuked Airbnb's head of Olympics and Paralympics partnership David Holyoke for not being more outspoken about criticism toward the Chinese government that it has prevented Uyghurs and Tibetans from obtaining passports and identification cards that would allow them to travel freely and register at hotels.
""In China we are required to follow local laws and regulations,"" Holyoke said, adding that ""human rights are core to our values.""
""You're just completely absolving yourself of responsibility for being complicit in abject discrimination,"" Malinowski said.
Asked repeatedly by Malinowski if Coca-Cola would specifically condemn any Chinese government abuses against Uyghurs, Lalli said without mentioning China: ""We respect all human rights.""
Malinowski noted that Coca-Cola was willing to wade into U.S. politics and condemn voting rights restrictions in its home state of Georgia, but would not criticize China's government.
""You are afraid of them in a way that you are not afraid of critics in the United States. I think that's shameful,"" Malinowski told Lalli, adding that it was ""absolutely clear"" that the company refused to criticize Beijing for fear it would harm its profits in China.

NEW YORK, July 27 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks fell on Tuesday, ending a five-day winning streak in the three major indexes, as investors were cautious before results from top tech and internet names and Wednesday's Federal Reserve announcement.
The Nasdaq led the day's declines, registering its biggest daily percentage drop since May 12, but the three indexes pared losses heading into the close and ended well off the lows of the session.
Shares of Apple Inc AAPL.O, Microsoft Corp MSFT.O and Google parent Alphabet Inc GOOGL.O, which all reported earnings after the bell, dropped and weighed the most on the Nasdaq and S&P 500 along with Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O, which is expected to report results later this week.
Also, electric-car maker Tesla Inc TSLA.O fell 2%, a day after it posted a bigger-than-expected second-quarter profit but said a global chip shortage that led to temporary factory shutdowns for the automaker remains serious.
Shares of the heavily weighted tech and internet companies have run up recently and last week regained leadership in the market, putting their results even more in the spotlight.
""Expectations are so high. They're going to have good numbers ... but we are expecting much more or maybe they will talk down the second half of the year,"" said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Investment Management in Chicago.
Adding to the cautious tone is the outlook for U.S.-listed Chinese stocks, he said. The shares including Baidu BIDU.O extended losses as fears over more regulations in the mainland persisted.
""There's a fair amount of (U.S.) investors in those companies,"" Nolte said.
Uncertainty also rose as the Fed began its two-day meeting, with investors looking for signs on when it intends to begin reining in its massive stimulus program.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 85.79 points, or 0.24%, to 35,058.52, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 20.84 points, or 0.47%, to 4,401.46 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 180.14 points, or 1.21%, to 14,660.58.
Helping to support the Dow, shares of McDonald's Corp MCD.N rose 1% ahead of its results due before the bell on Wednesday.
In another sign that investors were in a risk-off mood, defensive sectors such as real estate .SPLRCR and utilities .SPLRCU were the two best-performing S&P 500 categories for the day, and U.S. Treasuries prices rose.
Intel Corp INTC.O shares dropped 2.1% after it said its factories would start building Qualcomm QCOM.O chips and laid out a road map to expand its new foundry business.
Volume on U.S. exchanges was 10.36 billion shares, compared with the 9.86 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.87-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.65-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted 44 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 39 new highs and 235 new lows.

July 27 (Reuters) - Dutch semiconductor supplier ASM International ASMI.AS expects revenue to grow in the third and fourth quarters on the back of strong chip demand, despite pandemic-related supply chain challenges that continue to impact the company's earnings.
""Supply chain conditions further tightened during the quarter, also due to new lockdown measures in parts of Southeast Asia"", Chief Executive Benjamin Loh said in a statement.
Semiconductor groups struggle to meet chip demand, having faced supply chain challenges amid a global shortage in semiconductor chips.
The firm, whose customers include Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSMC) 2330.TW and Intel Corp INTC.O, reported record quarterly orders at 515.7 million euros, up 73% year on year, thanks to strong demand for logic and foundry business as well as its atomic layer deposition (ALD) technology.
Last week, chipmaker Intel said it still faces supply chain constraints and gave an annual sales forecast that implied a weak end of the year.
ASMI now expects third-quarter revenue of 400 million to 430 million euros ($473.20 million to $508.69 million), compared with 411.7 million euros in the previous quarter, and expects even higher sales in the fourth quarter.
The firm sees its third-quarter orders in the range of 510 million-530 million euros.
The group also said it is launching the 100 million-euro buyback program, previously announced in April.

July 27 (Reuters) - U.S. stock indexes retreated from record highs on Tuesday, with the Nasdaq tumbling as much as 2.1% as caution kicked in ahead of earnings reports from some of the most valuable technology companies on Wall Street.
Apple AAPL.O, Microsoft MSFT.O, Amazon AMZN.O and Google-parent Alphabet GOOGL.O, the four largest U.S. companies by market value sank between 1.3% and 2.6%, and were the top drags on the S&P .SPX and the Nasdaq .IXIC.
Apple, Alphabet and Microsoft are set to report earnings after the market closes, while Amazon will report results on Thursday.
""Professional investors are afraid that many of the companies in earnings seasons so far have been doing very well, but not necessarily moving up their guidance for the second half of the year to be as strong as the first half,"" said Kim Forrest, chief investment officer at Bokeh Capital Partners in Pittsburgh.
All of the heavyweight technology companies due to report this week were sporting recent record highs, with investors piling into them on their perceived resilience to COVID-related disruptions.
Facebook FB.O, which is set to report earnings on Wednesday, sank 1.9%.
At 12:06 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJIwas down 222.04 points, or 0.63%, at 34,922.27 and the S&P 500 .SPXwas down 44.22 points, or 1.00%, at 4,378.08.
The Nasdaq Composite .IXICwas down 307.84 points, or 2.07%, at 14,532.87. The tech-heavy index was set for its worst day since mid-May.
Investors also remained on edge ahead of more cues from the Federal Reserve on when it intends to begin reining in its massive stimulus program, with a two-day meeting kicking off on Tuesday.
Defensive sectors such as real estate .SPLRCR and utilities .SPLRCU were among the best-performing S&P sectors for the day. Treasuries rose and yields also retreated as investors positioned for the Fed meeting. US/
Wall Street's main indexes had inched up to record closing highs on Monday, carrying over momentum from a strong batch of corporate earnings last week.
Of the S&P 500 .SPX constituents, 153 companies have reported earnings so far and 88.9% of them have beaten estimates, according to Refinitiv data.
Electric-car maker Tesla Inc TSLA.O fell 3.6%, as concerns over production being hit by a semiconductor shortage offset initial optimism over a better-than-expected second-quarter profit.
U.S.-listed Chinese stocks extended losses as fears over more regulations in the mainland persisted. Alibaba BABA.N and Baidu BIDU.O lost about 5.5% and 4.5%, respectively.
General Electric GE.N rose around 0.3% after lifting its annual free cash flow forecast. But the company, once a bellwether for U.S. economic activity, warned that it was facing inflationary pressures that were likely to intensify in the rest of the year.
Intel Corp INTC.O sank 3.5% after it said its factories would start building Qualcomm QCOM.O chips and laid out a roadmap to expand its new foundry business.
Declining issues outnumbered advancers for a 2.91-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and for a 3.77-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.
The S&P index recorded 40 new 52-week highs and no new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 29 new highs and 202 new lows.

July 27 (Reuters) - Chipmaking equipment supplier BE Semiconductor (BESI) BESI.ASbeat its second-quarter revenue targets on Tuesday, driven by higher-than-anticipated shipments from its order backlog.
Soaring demand from major chip manufacturers like TSMC 2330.TW and Intel INTC.O, which are expanding production capacity to mitigate a global chip shortage, has largely benefited suppliers to the industry.
""Revenue was significantly above guidance due to higher than anticipated shipments from backlog as Besi managed supply chain issues and pandemic restrictions in various countries"", Chief Executive Richard Blickman said in a statement.
The shortfall, which has hit industries from consumer electronics to automaking, was driven by a surge in demand for phones, TVs and games consoles during the pandemic and then a stronger than expected economic rebound.
Revenues for the three months to the end of June rose 57.9% from the previous quarter to 226.1 million euros ($266.8 million), compared with a forecast of 30%-40% growth seen in April. The company credited broad based growth across end-user and geographic areas, particularly for high-end mobile applications, as well as increased shipments.
Delays in shipments impacted revenues in the previous quarter.
The Dutch-based maker of semiconductor assembly and packaging equipment added it expected revenues in the third quarter to fall by 5%-15% from the previous quarter, consistently with seasonal trends.
BESI, whose customers include tech companies, such as Samsung 005930.KS, Sony 6758.T and Qualcomm QCOM.O, said it also saw gross margins of between 60%-62% and operating expenses to decrease by 5%-10% in the July-September period.

Below I share a few highlights from the video.
Intel reported earnings on July 22, 2021. The company reported strong year-over-year (YOY) growth demand in its client computing and Internet of Things group. Intel's stock price dropped over 5% on July 23, 2021, as investors were not happy with the YOY decline in data center revenue and the fact that numerous analyst firms had lowered the price target on Intel.
AMD investors should keep an eye on the enterprise, embedded, and semi-custom segment, which includes revenue from the data centers and gaming consoles. Intel reported a 9% YOY decline in its data center group during Q2 earnings, and it could be a bullish sign if AMD reports growth in this segment, as AMD could be taking market share from Intel.
AMD investors should also keep an eye on the computing and graphics segment, which includes revenue from its graphics cards and processors for laptops and desktops. Intel reported 6% YOY growth in its client computing group during Q2 earnings due to strong demand, and the strong demand could also accelerate AMD's growth.

July 26 (Reuters) - Intel Corp INTC.O said on Monday its factories will start building Qualcomm Inc QCOM.O chips and laid out a roadmap to expand its new foundry business to catch rivals such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co 2330.TW and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd 005930.KS by 2025.
Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O will be another new customer for the foundry chip business, said Intel, which for decades held the lead in technology for manufacturing the smallest, fastest computing chips.
But Intel has lost that lead to TSMC and Samsung, whose manufacturing services have helped Intel's rivals Advanced Micro Devices Inc AMD.O and Nvidia Corp NVDA.O produce chips that outperform Intel's. AMD and Nvidia design chips which then are made by the rival chip manufacturers, called foundries.
Intel said on Monday it expects to regain its lead by 2025 and described five sets of chipmaking technologies it will roll out over the next four years.
The most advanced use Intel's first new design in a decade for transistors, the tiny switches that translate to digital ones and zeros. Starting as early as 2025, it will also tap a new generation of machines from the Netherlands' ASML ASML.AS that use what is called extreme ultraviolet lithography, which projects chip designs onto silicon somewhat like printing an old-fashioned photograph.
""We're laying out a whole lot of details to The Street to hold us accountable,"" Intel Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger told Reuters in an interview, referring to investors.
Intel also said it will change its naming scheme for chipmaking technology, using names like ""Intel 7"" that align with how TSMC and Samsung market competing technologies.
In the chip world where smaller is better, Intel previously used names that alluded to the size of features in ""nanometers"". But over time the names used by chipmakers became arbitrary marking terms, said Dan Hutcheson, chief executive of VLSIresearch, an independent semiconductor forecasting firm. This, he said, gave the mistaken impression that Intel was less competitive.
Intel's first major customers will be Qualcomm and Amazon. Qualcomm, which dominates chips for mobile phones, will use what Intel is calling its 20A chipmaking process, which will use new transistor technology to help reduce how much power the chip consumes.
Amazon, which is increasingly making its own data center chips for its Amazon Web Services, is not yet using Intel's chipmaking technology but will use Intel's packaging technology, the process of assembling chips and ""chiplets"" or ""tiles"", often stacking them up in so-called 3D formation. Intel excels in this packaging technology, analysts say.
""There have been many, many hours of deep and technical engagement with these first two customers, and many others,"" Gelsinger said.
Intel did not give details how much revenue or manufacturing volume the customer wins would bring, though Gelsinger said during an event announcing the news that the Qualcomm deal involved a ""major mobile platform"" and engaging in a ""deep a strategic manner."" Qualcomm has a long track record of using multiple foundry partners, sometimes even for the same chip.
The biggest question facing Intel is whether it can make good on its technology promises after years of delays under previous Chief Executive Brian Krzanich. In recent weeks, Intel announced the delay of a new data center chip called Sapphire Rapids.
But David Kanter, an analyst with Real World Technologies, said Intel is being more cautious than in the past. The years of delays resulted in part from the ""hubris"" of tackling multiple technical problems in a single generation of technology.
This time, Intel is laying out five generations of technology in four years, tackling smaller sets of problems, and also saying that it might not introduce the new EUV technology with its forthcoming ""Intel 18A"" process if it is not ready.
""Intel is absolutely going to catch up, and be ahead in some dimensions, with TSMC over the next few years,"" Kanter, the analyst, said. ""Intel really does have people who spend all their time looking at how to deploy new materials and technology to juice their performance.""

2021-07-26 00:00:00+00:00,Why Nvidia Stock Just Dropped,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-nvidia-stock-just-dropped-2021-07-26,,,"What happened
Shares of gaming graphics and crypto-mining semiconductor manufacturer Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) shed more than 3% in early trading this morning before retracing and recapturing some of those losses. As of 10:50 a.m. EDT, Nvidia stock is now down only 1.5% -- but it's still down.
Why is Nvidia down? An article that came out Friday afternoon on gaming website IGN may hold a clue or two.
Image source: Getty Images.
So what
Quoting CEO Pat Gelsinger of rival chip concern Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), from Intel's Q2 earnings call, IGN notes that the Intel boss predicts chip ""shortages [will] bottom out in the second half"" and that ""it will take another one to two years before the industry is able to completely catch up with demand.""
On the one hand, this suggests that in the near term, the pricing power that Nvidia commands from manufacturing a hot product in high demand (computer chips) may begin waning over the next few months -- even if it takes a couple more years to completely evaporate. For investors paying more than 92 times earnings for Nvidia stock today, that may sound worrisome, as it implies high profit margins won't stick around forever.
Now what
A second comment from the IGN report is also of concern. With semiconductors in such high demand currently, companies like Nvidia should, in theory, be able to command very high profit margins on their products. But as IGN points out, not all of this margin is in fact accruing to Nvidia and its peers.
""Scalpers,"" grouses the gaming site, ""have ... posed an additional problem"" by buying up the scarce chips, consoles, and other tech gear and then reselling them for ""hundreds of dollars above their suggested retail price."" On the one hand, this trend damages Nvidia's ability to control the prices at which its products sell, even as it threatens to damage the brand by making Nvidia's chips more expensive than they should be.
On the other hand, Nvidia isn't even profiting (as much as it might) from these high prices -- because ""scalpers"" are taking the windfall profits for themselves. Granted, with operating profit margins pushing 30%, Nvidia still makes very attractive profits from its products regardless.
But in a perfect world devoid of scalpers, Nvidia would probably be earning even more.

Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) will report earnings after the close on Tuesday July 27. AMD stock hasn’t been the worst performer out there, but it has been suspiciously quiet for about a year now.
Source: flowgraph / Shutterstock.com
While frustrating, that type of consolidation is incredibly healthy in my view. It gives the stock time to rest and a chance for it to build up some power to push higher. Of course, it’s even more frustrating when the overall markets continue to grind out all-time high after all-time high. Unfortunately, that also creates risk. Because an eventual correction in the broader market could unfairly hit AMD stock.
Regardless, this company is set to report earnings soon. I’m long and staying long and nothing this quarter will change that.
Why I’m Staying Long AMD Stock
The simple answer is usually the best answer and that is, I’m staying long AMD because it continues to generate impressive growth.

7 Cheap Value Stock Plays for August
Analysts expect substantial growth in both earnings and revenue. The year ago revenue and earnings per share were $1.93 billion and 18 cents respectively, and the average estimates for the upcoming report are $3.62 billion and 54 cents respectively. For the naysayers: no, that’s not just a post-Covid rebound.
AMD did robust business throughout 2020, continually blowing away consensus expectations. For 2020, estimates called for about $7 billion in revenue and 60 cents in EPS. AMD delivered over $2 per share in earnings on $9.76 billion in revenue.
Estimates for 2021 have exploded higher over the last 12 months. This is something I have been writing about for a while now, continually pointing out how conservative the analysts have been. The same goes for Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) too.
For what it’s worth, I am long NVDA stock as well. Like AMD, that thesis is simple too — it continues to generate above-average growth. Nvidia is building the backbone to various technologies and while it’s playing a larger role in that regard than AMD, both are helping to build our technological future, which is why I like both of them for the long term.
The focus doesn’t come down to any one quarter or earnings report. With a long-term view, investors understand there will be bumps in the road. Eventually those “conservative” analyst forecasts will likely become “aggressive” forecasts and these companies will disappoint. Perhaps that quarter is even among us in a few days. But the long-term demand for AMD’s products isn’t over and that’s why I remain bullish on this company.
Digging Deeper
AMD’s turnaround has been spectacular. Once left for dead and trading for sub-$2 in February 2016, it’s hard to imagine the run AMD has been on. Unlike many other companies with explosive revenue growth, AMD’s management has had the discipline to turn those dollars into bottom-line improvements.
AMD has become profitable, cash flow positive and lowered its debt load. More assets and fewer liabilities are a great combination for Wall Street.
Now the company is likely set to acquire Xilinx (NASDAQ:XLNX) for $35 billion. For that much money, one could argue that AMD could have acquired something a bit more exciting with more growth.
Honestly, I agree with that. But Nvidia could have acquired something more exciting than Arm, too. With these acquisitions, it’s not always about “exciting.” Instead, it’s about adding depth to the financial roster.
Look at Nvidia’s acquisition of Mellanox, a quiet company that had steady growth, earnings and cash flow with a low valuation. Nvidia scooped it up, tucked it into its current operations and instantly expanded its profitability.
AMD’s hoping to do the same thing with Xilinx — although Xilinx’s valuation is a bit higher and AMD is using stock to finance the deal. Admittedly, that can create some headaches when it comes to AMD’s stock price, but it should be better off in the long haul with Xilinx rather than without it.

In early July 2020, AMD stock exploded higher. That’s as the company was dominating against Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and as the latter faced a large delay in one of its chips. However, AMD has been relatively range-bound since.
Stuck between $74 and $87, the stock has had trouble getting out of this range. When it has, $95 has served as resistance.
Last week, AMD gave bulls a bullish engulfing candle by opening below the prior week’s range and closing above it. That’s positive, although earnings will be the main driver of the stock’s price action in the short term.
On a bullish post-earnings reaction, I’d love to see a push up through $95. Above $95 puts the all-time high of $99.23 in play, along with $100. Above $100 opens the door to 161.8% extension around $115.
On a bearish post-earnings reaction, I want to see AMD stock hold the $87 to $89 area. Below that puts the 50-week and 21-week moving averages back in play. Below that and $80 or lower could be on the table.

2021-07-26 00:00:00+00:00,Is This the Best Semiconductor Stock Right Now?,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/is-this-the-best-semiconductor-stock-right-now-2021-07-26,,,"This video will talk about another semiconductor player, and probably the most important, ASML (NASDAQ: ASML). We're going to have a look at its recent earnings report and what it's doing. This is the fourth semiconductor I've covered this month. We went over the comeback Intel is making, how AMD climbed the semiconductor ladder, and why Nvidia will join the trillion-dollar club.
What is ASML?
iPhones have chips that are designed by Apple and manufactured by TSMC, which uses ASML's systems. So what do these machines actually do?
Think of them as printers, very expensive printers. Each chip has many layers, and the EUV machine ""prints"" these layers. It takes around three to four months to build such a machine and about 100 or 150 people to assemble it and teach how it works.
Earnings highlights
ASML reported €4.0 billion net sales and €1.0 billion net income in Q2 2021, with net sales now expected to grow by around 35% in 2021. Q2 gross margin of 50.9% and net bookings of €8.3 billion are more than double net sales for the quarter. ASML also announced a new share buyback program of up to €9 billion to be executed by December 31, 2023.
Pros and cons
ASML's main competitor is its own previous systems. If the new system is not significantly better, what's the point of upgrading?
ASML also outsources a lot. So if one of its suppliers is not up for the job or has delays, that has negative effects on ASML and then on the rest of the industry. For example, the lenses and mirrors that ASML uses are from Carl Zeiss, and if that company can't deliver, ASML can't complete its machines.

2021-07-26 00:00:00+00:00,Is the Chip Shortage Over? Not So Fast,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/is-the-chip-shortage-over-not-so-fast-2021-07-26,,,"Semiconductor stocks have done very well since November amid booming demand and pandemic-induced supply constraints. Yet after solid year-to-date performance, investors appear wary of any hint of a slowdown and an end to the current boom phase of this cycle.
After several sector bellwethers recently reported earnings, semiconductor stocks took a bit of a dip. Management from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM), Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), and Texas Instruments (NASDAQ: TXN) all pointed to some easing of the current shortage in the most heavily affected auto chip sector. However, autos are only a small portion of industry, so it's misguided for investors to focus solely on that. Other comments pointed to continued demand strength that could last well into this decade, especially for leading-edge chips.
That's why the recent pullback may be short-lived, so investors may want to use the current weakness to pick up some shares of their favorite chip stocks.
Image source: Getty Images.
Some auto constraints are easing, and the shortage may be ""bottoming""
Taiwan Semiconductor, the largest foundry in the world, greatly increased its output of automotive chips last quarter, up 12% over the prior quarter, helping to ease the shortage of automotive microcontrollers (MCUs) that caused widespread shortages and work stoppages at global carmakers. TSM management now says the company is on its way to increasing its auto chip capacity by 60% this year. ""We expect the automotive component shortage from semiconductor to be greatly reduced for TSMC customers starting this quarter,"" management said on its most recent earnings call.
At the same time, Texas Instruments, which gets a much bigger proportion of its revenue from automotive chips, handily beat expectations last quarter, as auto-related chips more than doubled over the prior year. Yet management's guidance only pointed to flat to slightly higher sequential growth, in what is normally a stronger seasonal quarter for the company.
Finally, Intel management also said shortages will ""bottom out"" later this year, and it reported 124% year-over-year growth in its Mobileye autonomous car unit.
But don't get scared out of semis
With the easing of auto chip shortages, investors may be nervous that we are getting to the end of shortages more broadly. With multiple companies announcing big capacity increases over the next few years, some might think the industry is at a greater risk of oversupply -- and another ""bust.""
However, I think it would be a big mistake to sell semi stocks, which should continue to do quite well, even from these higher levels.
First, while Texas Instruments' guidance may have disappointed some, management attributed some of this to the lack of seasonality in the unique COVID-19 recovery environment:
Normal seasonal patterns may not be the best measure to look at things in periods like this. ... [T]he last few quarters have been exceptionally strong. Second quarter was certainly strong both sequentially and year-on-year. So if you look at our guidance, it would suggest that next quarter will again be a very strong quarter.
Texas Instruments also blew away the high end of its guidance last quarter, so the rather tepid sequential guidance may also just be conservatism in this uncertain environment.
Meanwhile, both Intel and Taiwan Semi gave extremely positive projections about non-auto chip demand, both in the short and long term.

A new age of semiconductors
While Intel did say it saw current shortages ""bottoming"" in the second half, that doesn't mean the broader industry shortage will end at that time, just that it won't get worse. CEO Pat Gelsinger elaborated, ""While I expect the shortages to bottom out in the second half, it will take another one to two years before the industry is able to completely catch up with demand.""
One to two years is a long time, and if that's true, it would be far too early to jump off the semiconductor train. Gelsinger said he's even seeing the PC market, which boomed during the pandemic, continue to expand beyond 2022, due to new hybrid and work-from-home arrangements. Couple that with the accelerated digitization of the economy more broadly, and Gelsinger thinks we are still in the ""early innings of what is likely to be a decade of sustained growth across the industry.""
Those incredibly bullish comments were echoed by Taiwan Semi. While the auto sector may get back into balance somewhat soon, auto chips generally rely on older nodes that are easier to ramp up. Meanwhile, Taiwan Semi is still struggling to keep pace with massive demand it's seeing for leading-edge technologies that go into new-age applications like 5G and artificial intelligence computing. Management also told investors that the company will likely grow at the high end of its long-term 10% to 15% annual growth rate, with even higher growth this year. Like Intel, Taiwan Semi sees a ""structural"" increase in semiconductor demand fueling shortages for the rest of this year and ""at least"" into 2022.
But perhaps the most important part of the leading-edge technology story isn't just the current demand strength, but also that it could even out historical volatility the semiconductor industry has seen in the past. CEO C. C. Wei importantly said, ""Even [if] inventory correction [were] to occur, we believe it will be less volatile than previous downturn as our underlying structural megatrend of 5G-related and HPC [high-performance computing] application will continue.""

Are semis turning into growth stocks?
Semiconductors have been subject to violent corrections in the past, most recently in 2018, which causes chip stocks to largely trade at a discount to other more consistent tech sub-sectors such as software. Yet remember, the 2018 downturn was triggered by the onset of the U.S.-China trade war -- a huge geopolitical event that may not happen again, or at least to the same degree. And if the underlying trends of 5G and high-performance computing limit volatility even further, semiconductor, memory, and semi equipment stocks could garner a valuation rerating higher.
In short, investors should probably stop playing the cycles and stick with semis over the long term this decade, even if the prominent auto chip shortage is easing.

Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) stock will come good. Just not right away.

The former chip industry leader is now cheap as chips. This after reporting net income of $5.1 billion, $1.24 per share on revenue of $19.6 billion for the June quarter.
The numbers beat estimates, but investors turned thumbs-down anyway, sending INTC stock down 2.5% overnight.
INTC stock was due to open July 23 at about $54.50, a market cap of $225 billion. The dividend, not threatened by the earnings, now yields nearly 2.5% and the price to earnings ratio is 12.5. The stock sells for barely three times last year’s sales.

7 Cheap Value Stock Plays for August
By contrast Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), which designs chips but doesn’t own a foundry, is at $196/share after a 4:1 stock split. That’s a market cap of $488 billion, a PE of 92, and the dividend yields .08%. The price to sales ratio is nearly 25.
What Went Wrong With INTC Stock
Intel didn’t get into trouble fast, and it’s not getting out of it fast either.
CEO Pat Geisinger didn’t rejoin the company until February, after nearly a decade running VMware (NYSE:VMW). Before that he had been with Intel for 30 years.
The man he was pushed out for, Brian Krzanich, turned out to be one of the worst CEOs of the last decade. That’s a rogues gallery that includes Virginia Rometty of IBM (NYSE:IBM), Jeff Immelt of General Electric (NYSE:GE) and Randall Stephenson of AT&T (NYSE:T).
Krzanich ran off competing voices and failed to compete in manufacturing, losing the lead to Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM). He was finally pushed out after a sex scandal.
Intel’s problems can be summed up in one word: ultraviolet. Taiwan Semiconductor has mastered Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography. It has a road map to make chips with circuit lines 2 nm apart later this decade. That’s thinner than the distance between strands of DNA. Intel is stuck at 10 nm.
Rather than cede the field to the Taiwanese, whose foundries supply Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices (NYSE:AMD) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), among others, Geisinger is doubling down. He’s putting $20 billion into two new Arizona chip plants. He’s also negotiating the purchase of Global Foundries, the Arab-backed chip foundry, at a price of about $30 billion.
It’s affordable, but it’s not cheap. Intel had $14.3 billion of operating cash flow in the first half of the year. The company also sent $5.2 billion during the first half to shareholders, in the form of dividends and stock buybacks. The cash flow, and payouts, were both lower than in 2020.
The current chip shortage sees Nvidia holding the pricing power Intel once had. It is continuing to gain share in data centers, even though clouds were designed to use cheaper chips.
What bears fear is that Intel could lose even its current pricing power if the chip shortage ends quickly. Texas Instruments (NYSE:TXN), another chip maker, has said revenues should flatten later this year. Intel’s forecast is that shortages continue, into 2023.
The Bottom Line
I was a huge critic of Krzanich. I wasn’t a fan of his successor, financial man Robert Swan. I didn’t start recommending Intel again until Geisinger was being recruited.
Shares rose sharply after Geisinger was hired, to as high as $68 in April, but the honeymoon is over. INTC stock trades today at around $53.
You don’t have to rush back into Intel, but it’s a good hedge against Nvidia gains. These have been spectacular. It’s up 343% in just the last two years.
There are no losers because everything is a computer now. I call it the Machine Internet and it’s one of the new decade’s big trends. You don’t need to rush back into Intel but three years from now the current price will look dirt cheap.

2021-07-26 00:00:00+00:00,Can Intel’s Strong Earnings Offset Supply Constraints?,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/can-intels-strong-earnings-offset-supply-constraints-2021-07-26,,,"Even with strong earnings results, a company’s shares may still slide. Intel Corporation (INTC) released earnings Thursday evening, and although it had beaten consensus estimates on sales, investors were shaken by the admission of a surprisingly prolonged semiconductor chip shortage. The stock opened about 5% lower on Friday, and has been trying to work its way back up since. (See Intel stock charts on TipRanks)  
Reporting on the development is Hans Mosesmann of Rosenblatt Securities, who wrote that the company announced strong guidance for the remainder of FY21 and an outlook that includes high demand levels. These positives were not enough to appease investors, and the supply side challenges prevailed as a sell signal. Intel indicated that the supply/demand relationship would not equalize until about 2023.  
Mosesmann reiterated a Sell rating on the stock, and declared a price target of $40. This target suggests a potential 12-month downside of about 24.5%, as of 10:30am EST Monday.  
The five-star analyst explained that the company has several new CPUs (central processing units) in its pipeline, such as the Alder Lake and Sapphire Rapids projects. Unfortunately, Sapphire Rapids has been delayed to at least the first half of FY22, and the Aurora Supercomputer project has faced rescheduling several times over the last six years. At this point, Mosesmann can not speculate on when it may be ready for commercialization.  
Intel’s upside rests on the increasing amount of household computing devices, as well as the increasingly shrinking rate at which they are replaced. Mosesmann added that Intel expects sales to increase 1% year-over-year by the end of FY21. However, gains made on the total addressable market will be hampered by the chip shortage.  
On TipRanks, INTC has an analyst rating consensus of Hold, based on 9 Buy, 11 Hold, and 8 Sell ratings. The average Intel Corp. price target is $59.96, reflecting a possible 12-month upside of about 11%.

2021-07-25 00:00:00+00:00,Chipmaker TSMC says too early to say on Germany expansion,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/chipmaker-tsmc-says-too-early-to-say-on-germany-expansion-2021-07-26,,,"TAIPEI, July 26 (Reuters) - Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC) 2330.TW said on Monday that it was too early to say whether it will build factories in Germany and that talks were in early stages, as the EU seeks to reduce chip imports amid a supply shortage.
The European Commission had held discussions with global chip giants, including Intel INTC.O and TSMC, as the EU seeks to boost semiconductor production and shield itself from shocks in the global supply chain.
Taiwan and TSMC, the world's largest contract chip manufacturer, have become central in efforts to resolve the pandemic-induced chip shortage that has forced automakers to cut production and hurt manufacturers of smartphones, laptops and even appliances.
""We are currently doing reviews on Germany seriously, but it's still in very early stages,"" TSMC chairman Mark Liu told an annual shareholder meeting when asked about building chip fabrication plants in the EU country.
""We continue to communicate with our major clients in Germany to see whether this is most important and effective for our clients,"" he said. ""It's too early to say.""
TSMC signalled in July plans to build new factories in the United States and Japan amid concern over the concentration of chipmaking capability in Taiwan, which produces most of the world's most advanced chips and is geographically close to political rival China.
On TSMC's $12 billion factory in the U.S. state of Arizona, Liu said the expansion would support client demand, especially in infrastructure and national security.
""Clients are the backing of our global expansion. We will move very cautiously,"" Liu said, adding that the company's customers would help share costs of overseas operations.
TSMC announced this year plans to invest $100 billion over the next three years to increase capacity, riding on what it called a ""multiple years of growth opportunities"", as the COVID-19 pandemic and new technologies drove global demand for advanced chips.

2021-07-24 00:00:00+00:00,3 Companies Moving Forward With Robotaxis as Tesla Delays,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-companies-moving-forward-with-robotaxis-as-tesla-delays-2021-07-24,,,"Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) and the company's investors have high hopes for so-called ""robotaxis,"" self-driving vehicles that are able to turn a depreciating asset into a profit center by sending your vehicle out to ferry passengers around town when not in use. But so far, the reality has not lived up to expectations.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk had hoped to have 1 million robotaxis on the road by the end of 2020, but good luck trying to flag down a driverless Tesla for a lift any time soon. And although Tesla continues to roll out updates to its ""Autopilot"" system, it is still very much a driver-assist system, and not a fully autonomous experience. Musk in announcing the latest software update urged customers to ""please be paranoid"" and not hand over too much responsibility to the vehicle.
The delays are not unexpected, as true high-tech self-driving is a really complicated challenge. And so far no company has been able to figure it out completely. But Tesla is hardly alone in working on the problem, and some of its rivals appear to be making at least as much, if not more, progress.
Here's why three Fool contributors are paying close attention to the autonomous efforts of Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F), and General Motors (NYSE: GM).
Image source: Getty Images.
""Mobileye Inside"" could power the autonomous revolution
Lou Whiteman (Intel): In the early days of Tesla's quest for robotaxis the electric vehicle manufacturer leaned heavily on chipmaker Mobileye, which makes hardware and software for smart cars. That partnership evaporated over time, and Mobileye in 2017 was acquired by Intel, but the company has not slowed its pursuit of autonomous driving.
Mobileye, with support from Intel's ample financial resources, has partnerships with more than two dozen automakers and its driver assist tech installed in more than 60 million vehicles worldwide. Most of the use today is in driver-assist technology designed to make vehicles safer, and not true autonomous driving, but each new tool is a stepping stone toward the robotaxi of the future.
Investors should get a better idea of the strength of Mobileye's autonomous tech in the next 18 months. The company has a partnership with Chinese automaker NIO (NYSE: NIO) to roll out a fleet of robotaxis in Israel in 2022. It is also working with electric delivery van start-up Udelv to deploy self-driving vans starting in 2023.
In working with so many vehicle manufacturers, Mobileye is mimicking the highly successful ""Intel Inside"" strategy its parent deployed in the early days of the personal computing revolution. Mobileye is both a brand in and of itself and also piggybacks on the strength of its automaker partner's brand and expertise, hopefully in time establishing the ""Mobileye"" logo on a vehicle as a seal of quality similar to how the Intel sticker is viewed on a personal computer or laptop.
It's been a long time since Intel was viewed as a growth stock, and indeed Intel shares have trailed the S&P 500 by nearly 40 percentage points over the past five years. But the company under new CEO Pat Gelsinger is attempting to rebuild itself around some of its most promising businesses and brands.
Mobileye has the potential to be a big part of what is next for Intel. Investors who are interested in autonomous should pay close attention to the progress made by this self-driving pioneer in the years to come.
Tesla talks a lot about self-driving taxis, but this ""dinosaur"" is actually about to deploy them
John Rosevear (Ford Motor Company): In case you missed it, Ford, self-driving start-up Argo AI, and ride-hailing giant Lyft (NASDAQ: LYFT) announced on Wednesday that they will together launch a self-driving taxi service by the end of 2021.
This announcement came as a surprise -- and while there's a big qualifier here, it does establish that Ford and Argo AI, in which Ford has a substantial stake, are nearly ready to enter the robotaxi wars for real.
As is probably obvious, the service will use Ford vehicles (specifically, Escape hybrids), Argo's Level 4 self-driving hardware and software stack, and Lyft's ride-hailing network to provide Lyft users with the option of trying a taxi that drives itself. The plan is to launch in Miami before year-end, and in Austin next year, with a goal of having at least 1,000 of the self-driving taxis deployed over the next five years.
The new robotaxi service will use Ford Escape Hybrids, equipped with Argo AI's proprietary lidar and software, operating on Lyft's ride-hailing networks. Image source: Ford Motor Company.
As part of the deal, Lyft will receive a 2.5% stake in Argo as partial payment for the licensing and data-access agreements. As for Ford, in addition to the vehicles, the Blue Oval will run the depot stations that will fuel, service, and clean the robotaxi fleets. (This -- self-driving fleet management -- is a potentially lucrative new business that Ford has been talking about since 2016.)
I mentioned that there's a big qualifier: the vehicles will have human safety drivers, at least for now and likely (the partners think) until 2023. That might seem like cheating, but consider: Having a human behind the wheel -- but not touching it -- will help convince non-tech-savvy customers that this new technology is safe.
Taken together, it's a much more conservative plan than the Tesla approach of throwing ""beta"" software out to retail customers to test on public roads while hoping that nobody dies. I'm sure some Tesla fans will sneer accordingly.
But it's the kind of plan that auto investors should expect from Ford, a company that knows how to win customers' trust over decades, and from the experienced and sober-minded scientists at Argo.
Tesla's better at making headlines -- but GM's better at making cars
Rich Smith (General Motors): Two years ago, Elon Musk said he was ""confident"" that Tesla would have more than 1 million autonomous robotaxis on American roads by 2020 (then qualified his statement with the admission that ""sometimes I am not on time""). I don't see Musk's electric car rival General Motors building a whole lot of robotaxis either, but GM does have one thing that Tesla doesn't: a contract to build robotaxis for a customer.
And one other thing: permission to operate robotaxis in California.
This year has been a big one for robotaxi news -- and for General Motors. In June, GM's ""Cruise"" autonomous driving subsidiary received the California Public Utilities Commission's first-ever license to carry passengers in fully autonomous vehicles with no driver present. The company also announced that it is expanding its investment in electric and autonomous vehicles, aiming to spend a total of $35 billion developing these technologies through 2025, and to develop at least 30 new EVs for sale.
GM and Cruise have confirmed that they will launch a self-driving taxi service in Dubai in 2023. Image source: General Motors.
One of the first of that number will be the Cruise Origin, an autonomous electric vehicle developed especially for Cruise. Analysts have described the Cruise Origin as offering riders a ""shared and social"" space and being ""more like a living room than a passenger car. Passengers face each other, more like a bus..."" And of course, the bus driver is a robot.
Cruise Origin is so good, in fact, that in April, it helped GM win a contract from the Dubai Roads and Transport Authority to begin deploying autonomous taxis in 2023. By 2030, GM expects to have 4,000 Cruise vehicles operating autonomously in Dubai.
Whether they'll meet any autonomous Teslas on their routes remains to be seen.

2021-07-24 00:00:00+00:00,4 Things You Might Have Gotten Wrong About Intel,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/4-things-you-might-have-gotten-wrong-about-intel-2021-07-24,,,"Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), the world's largest manufacturer of x86 CPUs for PCs and data centers, is closely scrutinized by tech and financial pundits. But despite all that attention, there are still plenty of misconceptions about its core business. Let's examine four issues that are frequently misunderstood.
1. ""Moore's Law"" ended years ago
Back in 1965, Intel's co-founder Gordon Moore predicted the number of transistors within the same area of silicon would double every year. That prediction, known was ""Moore's Law"", drove Intel to continuously develop smaller and denser chips. In 1975, Moore expanded the cycle from one to two years. That revised ""law"" held up until the past decade.
Image source: Getty Images.
Using Moore's Law as its foundation, Intel deployed a ""tick-tock"" cycle for chip upgrades: Each ""tick"" produced a smaller chip with a higher density, while each ""tock"" upgraded its architecture but didn't reduce its size. Up until 2012, Intel's ""ticks"" and ""tocks"" alternated like clockwork in two-year cycles.
But that cycle gradually lengthened due to the difficulties of manufacturing smaller and denser chips. Intel's latest 10nm chips, for example, were finally launched in 2019 after several delays -- but its next generation of 7nm chips won't arrive until 2023. Moore's Law clearly ended years ago, but Intel continues to tweak its definition, while referring to it as a ""metronome for the modern world"".
2. Node sizes and chip densities
Intel's decelerating development of smaller chips caused it to fall behind TSMC (NYSE: TSM) and Samsung in the ""process race"" to create smaller chips.
TSMC and Samsung both started mass producing 5nm chips last year, which seemingly puts both foundries two generations ahead of Intel. However, a simple comparison of node sizes doesn't take into account a chip's density, or the number of transistors within the same area.
TSMC, Samsung, and Intel are the only three foundries in the world that can manufacture chips smaller than 10nm. However, Intel's chips are actually denser than TSMC and Samsung's chips.
Therefore, Intel claims its 10nm chips are actually comparable to TSMC's 7nm chips -- which only puts it one chip generation behind TSMC and Samsung. But that argument might be rendered moot soon, since TSMC will likely start mass producing 3nm chips before Intel launches its 7nm chips.
3. The in-house myth
Intel manufactures most of its chips at its own foundry. That makes it an IDM (integrated device manufacturer) instead of a ""fabless"" chipmaker that outsources its production to a third-party foundry like TSMC.

When Intel started to fall behind TSMC and Samsung in the process race, many investors and analysts urged Intel to jettison its foundry business and becoming a fabless chipmaker like AMD (NASDAQ: AMD), which spun off its own foundry business more than a decade ago.
Yet Intel has quietly outsourced the production of its chips to other foundries in the past. TSMC manufactured its Atom CPUs, which mainly powered netbooks, mobile devices, and vehicle infotainment systems, and it recently agreed to manufacture Intel's new discrete GPUs and upcoming 3nm CPUs. Samsung also recently started to manufacture Intel's southbridge chipsets.
Therefore, the notion that Intel is a completely ""in-house"" IDM is false. In fact, it's become increasingly dependent on TSMC and Samsung even as it doubles down on expanding its own internal foundries.
4. Its ""new"" GPU business
Intel recently launched a new line of discrete GPUs that target Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and AMD's high-end cards. Some investors might assume these GPUs represent a new business for Intel -- but the chipmaker has actually made GPUs for years.
In fact, Intel is the world's largest maker of GPUs, since it bundles low-end integrated graphics chips with its mobile CPUs. If we include those integrated chips, Intel controlled 68% of the GPU market in the first quarter of 2021, according to JPR, while NVIDIA and AMD split the remaining 32%.
Intel tried to launch a high-end discrete GPU over a decade ago, but it abandoned those efforts due to the chip's technical shortcomings. Therefore, Intel's latest DG-series GPUs represent a return to this high-end market -- which is dominated by Nvidia and AMD -- but they're not the company's first GPUs.
How could these misconceptions affect investors?
Reviewing these four points gives investors a clearer understanding of the company's struggles and ambitions. The death of Moore's Law, which Intel still refuses to acknowledge, indicates it's becoming increasingly difficult to manufacture smaller and denser chips.
Its loss of the process lead to TSMC and Samsung -- and its desperate attempts to keep up by producing denser chips and quietly outsourcing its production to those same rivals -- indicate its foundry business will face plenty of challenges over the next few years. Its ""new"" GPU business also doesn't signify an innovative new step into a new market -- it's merely rehashing an old idea.
I'm not too optimistic about Intel's near-term future, but I think that bullish and bearish investors alike would do well to learn a lot more about the chipmaker by digging deeper into these four points.

NEW YORK, July 23 (Reuters) - Wall Street rallied for the fourth consecutive session on Friday, with the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq on track for record closing highs as upbeat earnings put investors in a buying mood.
All three major U.S. stock indexes were positioned to notch weekly gains.
Investor favor has seesawed between growth .IGX and value .IVX for much of the week as market participants weighed spiking infections of the COVID-19 Delta variant against strong corporate results and signs of economic revival.
""We’re going for a fourth consecutive up day after the Delta scare earlier in the week,"" said Joseph Sroka, chief investment officer at NovaPoint in Atlanta.
""The U.S. still looks like the best house on the block when you look around the world, even though there are concerns about inflation and labor,"" Sroka added. ""We’ve seen some increase in cases in COVID, it hasn’t been enough to give people too much pause in the market.""
Market participants now look toward next week the Federal Reserve's two-day monetary policy meeting and a series of high-profile earnings.
The Fed's statement will be parsed for clues regarding the timeframe for tightening its accommodative policies, although Chairman Jerome Powell has repeatedly said the economy still needs the central bank's full support.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 235.13 points, or 0.68%, to 35,058.48, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 43.78 points, or 1.00%, to 4,411.26 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 145.96 points, or 0.99%, to 14,830.56.
Of the 11 major sectors in the S&P 500, all but energy .SPNY were green, with communications services .SPLRCL enjoying the largest percentage gain.
Second-quarter reporting season is running at full-throttle, with 120 of the companies in the S&P 500 having reported. Of those, 88% have beaten consensus, according to Refinitiv.
Analysts now expect aggregate year-on-year S&P 500 earnings growth of 78.1% for the April to June period, a sizeable increase from the 54% annual growth seen at the beginning of the quarter.
Chipmaker Intel Corp INTC.O said late Thursday that it still faces supply constraints and provided disappointing guidance. Its stock fell 6.3%.
American Express Co AXP.N jumped 1.7% after posting second-quarter profit that handily beat expectations on the strength of a global recovery in consumer spending.
Social media firms Twitter Inc TWTR.N and Snap Inc SNAP.N gained 3.8% and 24.5%, respectively, on the back of their upbeat results.
Those reports bode well for Facebook Inc FB.O, which is due to post second-quarter results next week. Its stock gained 6.1%.
Other high-profile earnings expected next week include Tesla Inc TSLA.O, Apple Inc AAPL.O, Alphabet Inc GOOGL.O, Microsoft Corp MSFT.O and Amazon.com AMZN.O.
Industrials Lockheed Martin Corp LMT.N, Boeing Co BA.N, Ford Motor Co F.N, General Dynamics Corp GD.N, 3M Co MMM.N Caterpillar Inc CAT.N, Chevron Corp CVX.N and Exxon Mobil Corp XOM.N, along with a host of healthcare, consumer goods and others, are also on deck.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.52-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.16-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted 81 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 78 new highs and 126 new lows.
