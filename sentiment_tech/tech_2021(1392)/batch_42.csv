2021-02-11 00:00:00+00:00,2 Self-Driving Car Stocks to Buy in 2021,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/2-self-driving-car-stocks-to-buy-in-2021-2021-02-11,,,"Self-driving cars will change the world in countless ways. They hold the promise of riders being able to engage in other activities while in a vehicle, collisions and traffic deaths being significantly reduced, and the daily cost of travel dropping by as much as 80%.
According to analysts at Swiss bank UBS, the market for autonomous rideshare vehicles (or robotaxis) will reach at least $2 trillion by 2030. What's more, Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) believes the market could reach $7 trillion by 2050. For investors looking to cash in on the autonomous vehicle trend, NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Alphabet's (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Waymo look like long-term winners.
1. NVIDIA: The leading platform
According to a report by Navigant Research, NVIDIA and Intel's Mobileye are the two front-runners in the market for automated-vehicle computing platforms, though the report calls NVIDIA ""the clear leader"" in the space. These companies are building the artificial-intelligence (AI) systems that will power self-driving cars.

NVIDIA's DRIVE platform consists of hardware and software designed to support driverless vehicles, from level 2 (partly automated) all the way up to level 5 (fully automated). For instance, NVIDIA DRIVE software enables developers to build and deploy the necessary AI applications. And its DRIVE AGX Pegasus hardware -- which combines two systems-on-a-chip with two of NVIDIA's latest Ampere graphics processing units (GPUs) -- provides the computing horsepower needed to rapidly process data from lidar, radar, and cameras and run the deep neural networks that allow the car to move autonomously.
When it comes to AI, NVIDIA's best-in-class GPUs significantly outperform Intel's chips. And NVIDIA's industry-leading solution has helped the company attract dozens of partners, from start-ups to established enterprises. These include automakers Toyota, Audi, Volvo, and Daimler's Mercedes-Benz; mobility service providers like Airbus, Aurora Mobile, and Zoox (owned by Amazon); as well as researchers at prestigious institutions like University of California-Berkeley, Carnegie Mellon, and MIT.
NVIDIA is also unique in this market, since the company not only supplies the in-car computing platforms, but also the data-center infrastructure and simulation platform needed to train and validate the deep neural networks before deploying them in cars for real-world use.
For example, NVIDIA's DGX supercomputers are used in data centers across the globe to train AI algorithms, and the chipmaker's products are considered an industry standard. Put simply, NVIDIA's hardware is better, and its end-to-end process -- from the data center to the car -- creates a seamless experience for clients, giving the company a big advantage. That should keep NVIDIA ahead of its rivals.
2. Waymo: The leading robotaxi service
The report by Navigant Research also ranks the companies developing level 4 autonomous vehicles -- in other words, companies building robotaxis. In this category, Alphabet's Waymo comes out on top. And while General Motors' (NYSE: GM) Cruise and Ford (NYSE: F) are also considered leaders, Waymo has a few advantages over these rivals.
A Waymo robotaxi. Image source: Waymo.
First, as of April 2020, Waymo had completed 15 billion simulated-driving miles and 20 million autonomous real-world driving miles. By comparison, GM's Cruise announced in December 2020 that it had completed only 2 million real-world miles. In other words, Waymo has way mo' data, and data is a huge advantage when it comes to artificial intelligence.
Moreover, with the launch of Waymo One in 2018, it became the first company to offer an autonomous ridesharing service to select individuals. Today, that service is open to the general public in the Phoenix metropolitan area. And while GM's Cruise had plans to launch a similar service in San Francisco in 2019, that vision never became a reality, and the company has yet to reschedule.
Likewise, Ford had plans to launch a self-driving service in 2021, but has already delayed its launch until 2022. Waymo has consistently been a few steps ahead, and that doesn't appear to be changing.
Its position as a first-mover should be a powerful long-term advantage. And Alphabet generated more free cash flow in the last 12 months than Ford and GM combined, which means it can invest more aggressively in its technology. As a result, Waymo is expected to own 60% of the $2 trillion robotaxi market by 2030, according to UBS.
A final word
Autonomous vehicles are not particularly profitable for Alphabet or NVIDIA at this point. Over the trailing 12 months, NVIDIA generated $554 million in automotive revenue. Likewise, Alphabet's Other Bets business (which includes Waymo) generated $657 million in revenue -- less than 1% of the company's top line.
But that should change as more self-driving cars hit the streets in the coming years, and the market should expand rapidly. That's why both NVIDIA and Alphabet's Waymo are well positioned to be long-term winners.

Feb 11 (Reuters) - A group of U.S. chip companies on Thursday sent a letter to President Joe Biden urging him to provide ""substantial funding for incentives for semiconductor manufacturing"" as part of his economic recovery and infrastructure plans.
The chief executives of major U.S. firms such as Intel Corp INTC.O, Qualcomm Inc QCOM.O, Micron Technology Inc MU.O and Advanced Micro Devices Inc AMD.O signed onto the letter.
It comes as a global chip shortage has idled factory lines at Ford Motor Co F.N and General Motors Co GM.N, with executives at the automakers predicting billions in lost profit. Tight chip supplies have even made it hard for consumers to buy popular gaming consoles such as Microsoft Corp's MSFT.O Xbox and Sony Corp's 6758.T Playstation.
The missing chips are mostly manufactured in countries such as Taiwan and Korea, which have come to dominate the industry. The letter, sent by the Semiconductor Industry Association, said that the U.S. share of semiconductor manufacturing dropped from 37% in 1990 to 12% today.
""This is largely because the governments of our global competitors offer significant incentives and subsidies to attract new semiconductor manufacturing facilities, while the U.S. does not,"" the group said.
Congress last year authorized subsidies for chip manufacturing and semiconductor research, but lawmakers must still decide how much funding to provide. The U.S. chip group urged Biden to provide such funding in the form of grants or tax credits.
""Working with Congress, your administration now has an historic opportunity to fund these initiatives to make them a reality,"" the chip group wrote. ""We believe bold action is needed to address the challenges we face. The costs of inaction are high.""

Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) shareholders have enjoyed two years of unprecedented growth in the value of their investment. AMD stock put on a clinic in 2019 and through most of 2020.

With annual gains in excess of 150% and 96%, respectively, AMD has been one of the hottest tech stocks. However, since the start of December, that growth has plateaued. At this point, AMD stock has lost ground slightly in 2021. Even after a Q4 earnings beat in January, AMD slumped. Is the mediocre performance over the past two months a warning?
For some, the performance of AMD over the past two months has raised the possibility of selling their shares. For others, it’s an opportunity.
A Big Q4 Earnings Beat
You would think that the market would have reacted favorably to AMD’s fourth quarter earnings. On Jan. 26, the company reported revenue of $3.24 billion, up 53% year over year. Adjusted earnings per share for the quarter were 52 cents. Both beat Wall Street estimates, which were $3.03 billion and 47 cents, respectively. AMD said its business of selling embedded chips for servers and custom chips for game consoles was up 176% YoY to $1.28 billion. 
In addition, the company provided revenue guidance for Q1 of between $3.1 billion and $3.3 billion, and said it expects 2021 revenue to grow by 37%. 
7 Must-Own Stocks in February
Despite the earnings beat and optimistic revenue projections, AMD stock dropped over 6%.
AMD’s New PC and Laptop Processors
In 2020, Advanced Micro Devices continued its assault on the desktop PC market with Ryzen 5000 series processors. They were so popular, they quickly became difficult to find. 
In January, I wrote that AMD was a company to watch at the 2021 Consumer Electronics Show. It didn’t disappoint. New Rzyen 5000-series laptop processors were one of the most talked-about releases at CES 2021. AMD announced hundreds of new laptops equipped with Ryzen chips are coming this year. Many of the hottest new gaming laptops unveiled at CES 2021 feature the powerful new Ryzen chips.
In other words, after continuing to eat into the desktop PC market in 2020, 2021 is a year where AMD is positioned to win greater market share in the laptop market. This, at a time when PC sales have had their greatest increase in a decade, driven largely by laptop demand.
AMD Gets a Downgrade
However, it hasn’t been all sunshine and rainbows for AMD stock lately. Less than two weeks before Advanced Micro Devices reported its Q4 earnings, AMD stock got a downgrade. BMO Capital Markets analyst Ambrish Srivastava downgraded AMD to “underperform” from “market perform.” He also lowered his price target to $75 from $80. His reasoning: “AMD has done a tremendous job under its CEO, and valuation reflects the near flawless execution under her watch … However, we do think a large part of the rich valuation is also attributable to how poorly Intel has executed.”
Srivastava is concerned that a new CEO — the third since 2018 — will result in AMD’s processor rival getting its act together and regaining lost ground.
That’s a valid concern, but AMD is hardly going to sit still. The battle for PC processor market share may indeed become more competitive, but AMD has real momentum and its products are impressive on their own merit — not just because the competition has stumbled.
Bottom Line on AMD Stock
There are two camps when it comes to AMD stock. Among investment analysts it really comes down to a wait and see attitude, and buying now while the shares have stalled.
The analysts tracked by CNN Business have AMD stock rated as a consensus “Buy.” However, 12 of the 34 rate it as a “Hold.” There’s a clear division there. That being said, their median 12-month price target of $110 has 20% upside. That’s not the kind of growth we’ve seen from AMD shares over the past two years, but it’s still solid. 
If you’re interested in adding Advanced Micro Devices to your portfolio, now seems like an opportunity. Shares remain off their December 2020 high and the new Ryzen chips are just starting to hit the market. It’s not without risk — as pointed out in the BMO Capital Markets downgrade — and we’re unlikely to see a return of 2019’s triple-digit gains, but AMD stock remains well-positioned for continued, long-term growth.

2021-02-10 00:00:00+00:00,"Loeb's Third Point praises Intel, avoids crowded short positions",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/loebs-third-point-praises-intel-avoids-crowded-short-positions-2021-02-10-0,,,"Adds details, quotes from letter, background
BOSTON, Feb 10 (Reuters) - Billionaire investor Daniel Loeb called Intel's resources ""unmatched"" in the semiconductor industry and said his firm, Third Point, is ""excited"" to be a long-term investor.
Loeb updated Third Point's clients on progress at Intel INTC.O in a letter seen by Reuters. Less than eight weeks ago he pushed the company to attract fresh talent, keep its best people, and explore deal options.
Last month the company said Pat Gelsinger, who had worked at Intel decades ago, would return as Chief Executive after running VMware VMW.N.
Loeb heaped fresh praise on the new CEO in the letter after having tweeted about it last month.
""It is hard to think of a better person to motivate and inspire the best of Intel’s thousands of brilliant employees who will help build the company’s future,"" he wrote about Gelsinger on Wednesday.
Gelsinger will have to align the company's human, financial and intellectual property resources, which will put Intel in line to ""capture the full unbounded growth of this market opportunity,"" the letter said.
Loeb was similarly enthusiastic about insurer Prudential Plc PRU.L, saying the Asia franchise is ""substantially undervalued"" but praising two leaders for making positive changes.
Loeb staged a dramatic rebound in returns last year, when his Third Point Offshore Fund ended 2020 with a 20.5% gain.
He managed to sidestep much of January's market volatility with a 1.9% gain. His firm employs a wide variety of investment styles including investing in stocks and debt and activism.
Loeb said he sidesteps positions where many investors are already betting against the future of a company.
""We have mostly avoided taking short stakes in companies with modest liquidity and large short interest,"" he wrote only a few days after millions of small investors sent retailer GameStop's GME.N stock surging 1,700%, hurting a number of prominent hedge funds that had bet the stock would fall.

2021-02-09 00:00:00+00:00,7 Blue-Chip Stocks With Gains and Pedigree,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/7-blue-chip-stocks-with-gains-and-pedigree-2021-02-09,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Seasoned investors love blue chip stocks, which they regard as stable dividend-payers with wide moats and tangible assets. Such businesses usually have histories going back decades, as well as dependable revenues and profits. Some researchers regard blue-chips to be like bond-like stocks. Therefore, today’s article introduces seven blue chip stocks with gains and pedigree.
Inspired by the game of poker, where the blue chips on the table have the highest value, shares of some companies are called blue chip stocks. When it comes to long-term investment decisions, many retail investors perceive the familiar names of such blue chip companies to be safer and more appropriate for their portfolios. In the U.S., members of the Dow-30 are typically accepted as blue-chip stocks.
The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) urges on portfolio diversification and states, “By picking the right group of investments, you may be able to limit your losses and reduce the fluctuations of investment returns without sacrificing too much potential gain.”
Blue-chip stocks can help you diversify a long-term portfolio. While a part of your portfolio could be in other types of stocks, such as growth companies that tend to have higher risks coupled with more volatility in price. With that background, here are seven options you may want to research further for investing in blue chip stocks in 2021.
7 F-Rated Growth Stocks to Sell Sooner Than Later

Intel (NASDAQ:INTC)

Blue Chip Stocks: 3M (MMM)

52-Week range: $114.04 – $187.27
Dividend yield: 3.28%
Saint Paul, Minnesota-based 3M provides more than 60,000 products used in homes, businesses, schools, hospitals and other industries. Many of us would instantly recognize several of the brands, such as Ace, Futuro, Nexcare, Post-it, and Scotch-Brite. The company operates in four business groups including safety & industrial, transportation and electronics, healthcare, and consumer.
Q4 results released on Jan. 26, 2021 showed sales of $8.6 billion, up 5.8% year-over-year (YoY). Net income was $1,4 billion, an increase of 43.3% YoY. Adjusted EPS was $2.38, up 22.1%. Adjusted free cash flow came at $2.1 billion, up 16%.
Its health care and home improvement products have seen sales improve in recent months. However, sales of office products are still sluggish.
CEO Mike Roman cited, “Throughout 2020 we distributed two billion respirators globally and supported the development and manufacturing of vaccines and therapeutics to help the world respond to COVID-19… Moving forward we will continue to prioritize investments in growth, productivity and sustainability as we build on our progress and deliver strong results in 2021.”
MMM stock’s forward P/E and P/S ratios are 19.55x and 3.24x, respectively. A potential decline toward the $170-level would improve the margin of safety for long-term investors in the shares of this industrial conglomerate.
Apple (AAPL)

52-Week range: $53.15 – $145.09
Dividend yield: 0.60%
Consumer electronics and tech giant Apple is the largest U.S. company with a market cap of $2.3 billion. It is also one of the most profitable.
The company released FY21 Q1 metrics on Jan. 27, 2021. Revenue came at $111.4 billion, up 21% YoY. Investors were delighted with the highest revenue figure ever.
Net income came at $28.8 billion, an increase of 29%. Q1 earnings per diluted share was $1.68, and increased 35% YoY. Cash and equivalents were $36 billion, down 5%.
CFO Luca Maestri said, “Our December quarter business performance was fueled by double-digit growth in each product category, which drove all-time revenue records in each of our geographic segments and an all-time high for our installed base of active devices. These results helped us generate record operating cash flow of $38.8 billion. We also returned over $30 billion to shareholders during the quarter.”
AAPL stock is up over 71% in the past 12 months and hit a record high of $145.09 in late January. Its forward P/E and P/S ratios stand at 37.3x and 8.08x, pointing to an expensive valuation level.
7 International Stocks to Avoid for Now
Those investors who pay attention to technical charts should note that the long-term technical message is a “buy,” while short-term oscillators are at overbought levels. A momentum stock like Apple can stay overbought for long periods of time. Yet some selling pressure in the coming weeks could offer a better entry point into the darling of Wall Street.
Coca-Cola (KO)

52-week range: $36.27 – $60.13
Dividend yield: 3.29%
Atlanta, Georgia-based Coca-Cola has more than 700,000 employees worldwide. It has some of the most important successful non-alcoholic brands including Coca-Cola, Sprite, Fanta and other soft drinks.
According to financial results released late October, Q3 net revenues declined 9% to $8.7 billion and organic revenues (non-GAAP) declined 6%. Non-GAAP net income was $2.4 billion, down 9.8% YoY. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.55, declined 2% YoY. Free cash flow was $5.5 billion, also down 17%.
CEO James Quincey stated “We are accelerating our transformation that was already underway, shaping our company to recover faster than the broader economic recovery. While many challenges still lie ahead, our progress in the quarter gives me confidence we are on the right path.”
KO stock’s forward P/E and P/S ratios are 25.87x and 6.41x, respectively. Due to global closures of restaurants and entertainment venues, the company had a difficult year in 2020.
It is possible that the pandemic could continue to affect the business deeper into the new year. However, I believe the current price reflects that likelihood. Eventually, as economies open up, KO shares will do better. I believe the stock offers value below $50.
Intel (INTC)

52-week range: $43.61 – $68.09
Dividend yield: 2.39%
Intel is the largest chipmaker globally, with products ranging from personal computing to data centers. It delivers computer, networking, data storage, and communications platforms. The company is currently the market-leading provider of central processing units (CPUs) for laptops, desktops, and servers.
The company released Q4 results on Jan. 21. Q4 revenue was $20 billion, down 1% YoY. Non-GAAP net income was $6.2 billion, down 6% YoY. It delivered earnings per share of $1.52 on a non-GAAP basis, down 10% YoY. In 2020, the company generated a record $35.4 billion cash from operations and $21.1 billion of free cash flow during the quarter.
CEO Bob Swan cited, “We significantly exceeded our expectations for the quarter, capping off our fifth consecutive record year. Demand for the computing performance Intel delivers remains very strong and our focus on growth opportunities is paying off. Intel is in a strong strategic and financial position as we make this leadership transition and take Intel to the next level.”
INTC stock’s forward P/E and P/S ratios stand at 11.98x and 3.16x. The shares have underperformed both the semiconductors sector and the broader U.S. equity market over the past years. Yet, since the start of 2021, the shares are up about 18%. Wall Street cheered the quarterly results and the fact that  management guided above analyst expectations as well as raised the dividend.

52-week range: $84.11 – $142.69

Our next choice is an exchange-traded fund (ETF), namely the iShares Russell 1000 Value ETF. The fund tracks the Russell 1000 Value Index, and provides exposure to large- and mid-cap U.S. companies that are thought to be undervalued by the market relative to comparable companies.
Buying an index that represents a large segment of the market could appeal to a large number of retail investors. The fund started trading in May 2000 and currently has 850 holdings. Total net assets of the fund are around $43 billion. As far as sector allocations are concerned, financials leads the ETF with 19.52%, followed by health care (13.63%), and Industrials (13.11%).
The top ten names, with approximately equal weights, make up around 16% of net assets. Warren Buffett’s conglomerate holding company Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A) (NYSE:BRK.B), financial giant JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) and healthcare products leader Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) head the roster.
After seeing the 52-week high on January 14, IWD price has come under pressure in recent days. The fund is a stable dividend payer with blue chip stocks and can be considered by long-term investors.

""Beyond autonomous driving the concept of vertical mobility could be a next step to take our mobility approach into the future, especially in the technically affine Chinese market,"" the German group said in a statement.
""Therefore we are investigating potential concepts and partners in a feasibility study to identify the possibility to industrialize this approach.""
In an interview with Volkswagen CEO Herbert Diess on Linkedin, the carmaker's China head Stephan Woellenstein said the company wanted to develop a drone that could be licensed, giving it a way to participate in this future market.
China is the world's biggest autos market, and also accounts for the largest part of Volkswagen's sales.
The news comes as companies from start-ups to other global carmakers are racing to develop commercial ""robo-taxis"", hoping to cash in on a market Morgan Stanley says could be worth $1.5 trillion by 2040.
In addition to big players such as Volkswagen and Airbus AIR.PA, groups including U.S.-based Joby, Germany's Lilium, and Volocopter, whose financial backers include Daimler DAIGn.DE and Intel INTC.O, are pursuing such plans.
Munich-based Lilium said in November it would set up its first U.S. hub near Orlando, putting more than 20 million Floridians within range of its winged electric aircraft that can take off vertically and cover 300 km (185 miles).

2021-02-05 00:00:00+00:00,AMD Loses Market Share to Intel,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/amd-loses-market-share-to-intel-2021-02-05,,,"Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) has been steadily gaining market share from market leader Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) across the board since the company launched the first chips based on its Zen architecture in 2017. A combination of solid products from AMD and missteps from Intel fueled AMD's unlikely comeback.
That streak of market share gains came to an end in the fourth quarter of 2020, according to data from Mercury Research as reported by the PC-focused website Tom's Hardware. While demand for AMD's processors remains strong, shortages allowed Intel to recapture some lost market share.

Intel has a key advantage
AMD relies on third-party foundries to manufacture its chips. The company used to make them itself, but it spun off its manufacturing operations more than a decade ago. That move allowed AMD to focus on chip design and freed it from having to pour vast amounts of capital into manufacturing.
AMD's use of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing's top-tier process for its new chips, along with Intel's manufacturing struggles, helped AMD win back a bunch of market share over the past few years. AMD's latest Ryzen 5000 desktop processors finally beat Intel's chips on single-threaded performance, which is particularly important for PC gaming. That would have been unthinkable even a few years ago.
But relying on third-party foundries has a cost: AMD can only sell as many chips as it can get made, and capacity is tight. Auto manufacturers are warning that a chip shortage will force production cuts this year, and devices like game consoles are in short supply.
Getting new capacity up and running takes time, and there are many companies fighting for that capacity. Demand for AMD's chips is outstripping supply, and there's not much it can do about it.

Intel doesn't have this problem. While the company has had difficulties with production over the past few years, particularly related to its troubled 10nm manufacturing process, Intel doing most of its own manufacturing means that the company doesn't face the same constraints as AMD. Intel was able to capture business that would have likely been won by AMD absent a chip shortage in the fourth quarter.
While Intel no longer has a manufacturing edge over third-party foundries in terms of technology or capabilities, doing its own manufacturing does give it an edge over rivals during times of tight third-party foundry capacity. AMD's chips are on par or better than Intel's chips at this point, but you can't sell what you can't make.
Intel still needs to get its act together on the manufacturing front. Capacity shortages won't last forever; neither will the pandemic-driven boom in demand for laptops and other devices. Market share gains for AMD will likely resume once the chip shortages ease.
AMD still had a strong fourth quarter despite losing share to Intel. Total revenue soared 53% thanks to shipments of game console chips, while the core computing and graphics segment produced 18% growth. However, the stock is priced for some serious growth. The company produced adjusted earnings per share of $1.29 last year, putting the price-to-earnings ratio at a frothy 68.
Chip shortages will make it difficult for AMD to grow fast enough in the near term to justify that sky-high valuation. That could put some pressure on the high-flying stock.

Feb 4 (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics Co Ltd 005930.KS is considering Austin, Texas, as the site for a new $17 billion chip plant that the South Korean firm said could create 1,800 jobs, according to documents filed with Texas state officials.
The documents say the project would involve building out 7 million square feet (650,000 square meters) of new space on a 640-acre (259-hectare) site that the company already owns. The company has an existing chip plant in Austin that makes computing chips.
Samsung's filing said it plans to make ""advanced logic devices"" for outside customers at the facility, meaning it would aim to make the smallest, fastest kinds of computing chips.
While Intel Corp INTC.O makes such chips for itself in the United States, most contract manufacturers who make them for outside clients, such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSMC) Co Ltd 2330.TW and Samsung, maintain most of their facilities in Taiwan and Korea, respectively.
Those facilities make chips for American customers such as Apple Inc AAPL.O and Qualcomm Inc QCOM.O. TSMC last year disclosed plans for a $12 billion chip plant in Arizona expected to come online in 2024.
Samsung said in its filings that if Austin is selected, the company would break ground on the site in the second quarter of this year and that the plant will become operational in the third quarter of 2023.
The filings with Texas officials were made public Thursday and earlier reported by the Austin American-Statesman newspaper.

2021-02-04 00:00:00+00:00,The Easy Gains Are Over for Advanced Micro Devices,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/the-easy-gains-are-over-for-advanced-micro-devices-2021-02-04,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is one of the most impressive comeback stories of the past five years or so. Its tantamount to a David-and-Goliath match-up, with the company having to face off against mega-rivals like Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). But CEO Lisu Su was masterful in her strategy — and the result has been huge gains for shareholders in AMD stock.

When it comes to this year, though, things have gotten a bit shaky. For instance, consider the fact that AMD has gone from $95 in late January to around $87 now.
Of course, it’s true that the return for the past 12 months has been roughly 83%. But there has also been increased volatility in the markets. That means a pullback is inevitable and healthy.
However, for AMD stock, what about the rest of the year? Does it make sense to buy this name on the dip? Let’s take a look.
AMD Stock in the Fourth Quarter
The fourth quarter results for AMD — which were reported last week — were standout. Quarterly revenues shot up by 53% to $3.24 billion and full-year revenues jumped 45% to $9.76 billion. Net income also doubled. All in all, the company beat the Street on both the top and bottom lines.

AMD was also able to continue to produce strong cash flows. In Q4, operating cash flow came to $554 million. Now the company currently has about $2.29 billion in the bank.
And going forward, it expects the growth to remain strong, albeit at a slower pace. For this year, its revenues are forecast to grow at 37%.
But despite all that, Wall Street really wanted more. This helps explain the pressure we’ve seen on AMD stock after its earnings announcement.
To dive into more specifics, though, the company had a busy quarter with some nice wins. Take a look at the following highlights:
At this year’s CES conference, AMD announced the AMD Ryzen Pro 5000 Series Mobile processors for enterprise, the Radeon RX 6000 Series of GPUs (graphics processing units) for “next-generation PC gaming” and more well-received hardware
AMD announced a joint partnership with IBM (NYSE:IBM) for developing systems for “hybrid cloud environments”
AMD increased its cloud capabilities for Amazon’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) AWS platform.
HP (NYSE:HPE), CSC Finland and EuroHPC teamed up with AMD to use its CPUs and accelerators for supercomputer systems.
While growth was robust across all the main businesses for AMD, the area that saw the most traction was its enterprise business. Revenues were up a sizzling 176% YOY to $1.28 billion. This division involves the company’s main server chips, CPUs and GPUs.
With the console business heating up because of new launches from Sony (NYSE:SNE) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), there has also been a surge in demand for semi-custom offerings. The growth has actually been higher than the prior upgrade cycle.
Finally, robust growth has kept up in the company’s cloud business, too, with success in securing adoption by biggies like Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG) and more.
What to Think of AMD
However, while the business is certainly healthy, there are risk factors for AMD stock. The company is in the process of pulling off a $35 billion acquisition of Xilinx (NASDAQ:XLNX). Making that deal will be no easy feat, in terms of both the integration and dealing with the different company cultures.
Next, the competitive landscape is also getting more intense. Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) continues to take market share from AMD in data centers and is benefitting from the artificial intelligence (AI) megatrend. And even Intel has been getting things back on track, hiring a new CEO who should get results.
Worst of all, though, AMD stock is still far from cheap. Its current forward price-earnings ratio is 45.8. In other words, there is little room for error in the company’s performance for the next few quarters.

2021-02-04 00:00:00+00:00,"Why Intel, Applied Materials, and ASML Holdings Rose as Much as 12% in January",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-intel-applied-materials-and-asml-holdings-rose-as-much-as-12-in-january-2021-02-04,,,"What happened
Shares of Applied Materials (NASDAQ: AMAT), Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), and ASML Holding (NASDAQ: ASML) rose 12%, 11.4%, and 10.5%, respectively, in the month of January, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence.
While Intel had its own unique circumstances with the appointment of its new CEO, all three stocks benefited from general strong guidance by important semiconductor companies. That included Intel and ASML specifically, which both had their earnings reports toward the end of the month. And a big Applied Materials customer reported a huge surge in spending, helping Applied's stock rise along with the other two chip heavyweights.
Semiconductors had an electrifying month in January. Image source: Getty Images.
So what
First, Intel had a very eventful month, with the appointment of new CEO Pat Gelsinger, whom Intel poached from VMware (NYSE: VMW). The move was broadly cheered by investors and industry participants alike. Prior to VMware, Gelsinger was actually a 30-year veteran of Intel and a respected technologist, who only left the company after initially being passed over for the Intel CEO job a decade ago. His background seems ideal for Intel, which has struggled with its technology manufacturing and has fallen years behind Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) in producing leading-edge chips.
Intel's stock had been battered amid these manufacturing problems, and activist investors joined the fray late last year, advocating for change. The Gelsinger appointment appears to fit that bill, as he will replace the more financially focused current CEO Bob Swan, the company's former CFO.
Intel's stock surged on news of the new appointment, and then got another boost of confidence when it released fourth-quarter earnings results. Revenue came in at $20 billion -- down 1% year over year but smashing pessimistic analyst expectations -- and earnings per share of $1.52 beat expectations by a whopping $0.42. Management also guided above analyst expectations for the current quarter, and raised its dividend.
Though Intel has been losing market share to rivals, the semiconductor sector has been booming overall, as evidenced by the incredibly strong results from the aforementioned Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing. In fact, Taiwan Semiconductor reported such booming demand that management forecast a 52% increase in capital expenditures for 2021, and possibly more.
That spending boom will be hugely beneficial to leading semiconductor equipment suppliers such as ASML, which has a monopoly on crucial EUV lithography technology, and Applied Materials, which has the broadest semiconductor equipment portfolio across metrology, inspection, and etch-and-deposition machines. It's no surprise that both ASML and Applied surged on the TSM news. Additionally, ASML reported its fourth-quarter earnings later in the month, which also came in above expectations, and the company raised its dividend by 15%.
Now what
It was a great month for semiconductor stocks in general, which lifted all from the very best-positioned (ASML) to even those that were struggling (Intel). While the industry has traditionally been cyclical, keep in mind we're coming off two years of a trade-war-inspired downturn, then a further headwind with COVID-19. With 5G, artificial intelligence, and mass digitization expected to accelerate in the pandemic's aftermath, we could be entering a multiyear chip boom. Semiconductor stocks are also generally much cheaper than high-flying software-as-a-service stocks, making them look like some of the best bets in the tech sector today.

2021-02-04 00:00:00+00:00,Is AMD Stock a Buy?,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/is-amd-stock-a-buy-2021-02-04,,,"Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) has turned into one of the more notable tech comebacks. Under Lisa Su's leadership, the company has gone from the brink of bankruptcy to becoming a fast-growth chip stock. But can new investors still profit from AMD's success? Let's take a closer look at the company and its financials to learn more.
AMD's comeback
When Su took over the company, the decline of the PC had decimated it. AMD had become a penny stock and appeared headed for bankruptcy.
According to CNN Business, to stage a comeback, Su first decided to focus on industry niches where AMD could rise to No. 1 or No. 2. This led to a focus on graphics processing units (GPUs) and central processing units (CPUs).
Image source: Getty Images
Su also bought some time by speeding the so-called ""tick-tock"" development cycle. Developed by Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), the tick cycle involves manufacturing advancements, while the tock cycle emphasizes improving chip architecture. Intel alternates these cycles each year. However, AMD began to work on both simultaneously. Su told CNN Business that this approach involved ""convincing"" potential customers that it could work but ultimately won over doubters with its results.
Addressing competition
AMD entered the GPU business when it bought ATI in 2006. However, it has only recently stepped up its game in competing with NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA)
It initially focused on lower-end chips sold at lower prices. This helped it become the GPU of choice for Microsoft's Xbox and Sony's PlayStation lines of video game consoles.
By 2019, AMD had caught up or exceeded NVIDIA's performance, particularly with the release of its Radeon RX 5700 graphics card, according to Tom's Hardware -- all while maintaining lower pricing than its peer. Today, AMD has made gained control of about 23% of the market for stand-alone graphics cards, according to Wccftech.
In battling Intel, AMD has experienced even more success. AMD enlisted former employee Jim Keller to design a smaller, faster next-generation CPU that helped it catch up to and beat Intel, which continues to struggle in its efforts to make larger and less efficient designs. Intel doesn't expect to release a chip comparable to AMD's current best until at least 2022. Consequently, AMD now leads Intel 51%-49% in the desktop CPU market, according to Passmark Software. While Intel maintains a lead in the overall CPU market, AMD's share there has risen to 40%.
AMD's financials
These successes have greatly benefited AMD's financials. In the latest fiscal year, revenue increased by 45% from year-ago levels to almost $9.8 billion. This helped company profits to rise by an astounding 630% year over year.
Slower growth in expenses such as research and development and selling, general, and administrative expenses allowed operating income to more than double. Additionally, an income tax benefit of more than $1.2 billion helped lift AMD's GAAP net income to almost $2.5 billion in 2020. Without the tax and other benefits, non-GAAP net income came in at just under $1.6 billion, still a 108% increase from 2019.
The company forecasts that revenue will rise 37% in 2021. While GAAP income may decline without the tax benefit, investors should probably factor out that one-time boost when calculating income gains. Not counting the tax benefit, I would expect another significant surge in net income in the coming year.
Both the results and the prospects for continued increases have helped take the stock higher by just under 90% over the last 12 months. AMD now trades at just under $90 per share -- astounding growth for a stock that sold for under $2 per share as late as 2016.
AMD data by YCharts
Nonetheless, this massive surge has made AMD stock more expensive. Although the income tax provision spiked profits, AMD sells for just under 45 times earnings. If company forecasts for 2021 prove accurate, this valuation will probably not fall in the foreseeable future. However, its multiple comes in well below NVIDIA's P/E ratio of around 90. Also, if non-GAAP income growth can exceed the forecasted revenue increase, the current P/E ratio is probably a reasonable valuation for AMD stock.
Where AMD goes from here
Despite this multiple, AMD's focus on core competencies continue to foster competitive advantages and earn returns for its stockholders. Over the next year, AMD should prosper between its GPU niches and its technical lead over Intel in CPUs. I would not necessarily predict that AMD stock can double once again in 2021. However, given the expected revenue increases, AMD's growth story will likely not end anytime soon.

2021-02-03 00:00:00+00:00,Qualcomm shares drop as patent licensing forecast disappoints Wall Street,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/qualcomm-shares-drop-as-patent-licensing-forecast-disappoints-wall-street-2021-02-03,,,"By Stephen Nellis
Feb 3 (Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc QCOM.O shares dipped as much as 7% in after-hours trading on Wednesday as the company reported fiscal first-quarter sales that slightly missed Wall Street expectations and forecast lower-than-expected sales for its profitable patent licensing business.
The declines came as the firm forecast fiscal second-quarter sales and profits above Wall Street expectations, driven by a wave of phone buyers around the world upgrading their devices for 5G network connectivity.
The San Diego, California-based chip designer forecast sales with a midpoint of $7.6 billion and adjusted profit at a midpoint of $1.65 per share, compared with estimates of $7.10 billion and $1.57 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Qualcomm is the world's biggest supplier of chips that help mobile phones connect to cellular data networks, providing chips to Apple Inc AAPL.O and other handset makers. But the company is also building out businesses supplying chips to automakers such as General Motors Inc GM.N, which last week disclosed a deal to source chips from Qualcomm, and challenging Intel Corp INTC.O with new processors for laptop and desktop computers.
Two of the company's newer business lines - radio frequency chips to help devices handle newer 5G signals and internet-of-things chips for devices such as wireless headphones - have now become billion-dollar-per-quarter businesses.
Cristiano Amon, the company's president who will take over as chief executive in June, said that the company expects chip supplies to remain tight until the second half of the year. He said demand was outstripping supply as rivals of Huawei Technologies Co Ltd's HWT.UL, which largely did not use Qualcomm's chips, moved in to take the Chinese brand's market share after a U.S. blacklisting last year.
""We're seeing growth of share in a preeminent high tier,"" Amon said.
Steve Mollenkopf, Qualcomm's current chief executive, added: ""If we could make more, we could sell it.""
Qualcomm forecast a midpoint of $6.25 billion in revenue for its chip business in the fiscal second quarter, beating estimates of $5.62 billion, according to data from FactSet. Qualcomm forecast a midpoint of sales for its licensing business, which has higher margins than its chip business and generates much of its profit, of $1.35 billion, lower than estimates of $1.43 billion, according to FactSet.
The higher sales of chips - and chips with better margins - accounted for the company's above-expectations profit forecast despite falling short of estimates for its licensing business, Akash Palkhiwala, Qualcomm's chief financial officer, told Reuters.
""There's a mix shift that's happening within our business,"" he said.
For the fiscal first quarter ended Dec. 27, Qualcomm said sales and adjusted profit were $8.24 billion and $2.17 per share, compared with analyst estimates of $8.27 billion and $2.10 per share, according to Refinitiv data. Chip and licensing revenue were $6.53 billion and $1.66 billion, respectively, compared with estimates of $6.51 billion and $1.72 billion, according to FactSet data.
Qualcomm said first-quarter sales for handset chips were $4.22 billion, jumping 79% from a year before on the strength of 5G phone upgrades. Sales of radio frequency chips, a growth area for Qualcomm, increased 157% to $1.06 billion. Automotive chips sales were $212 million, up 44% from the previous year.

Well, before the world had ever heard of  r/WallStreetBets — the Reddit forum that’s setting the financial markets ablaze — there was Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD). You see, five years ago, AMD stock was trading hands in low-single-digit territory. And by low, I mean below $2. But then, it would prove all doubters wrong by engineering what can only be described as a remarkable business turnaround.

It’s too early to tell what defining impact r/WallStreetBets will have on its corporate targets. Sure, its efforts to engineer a short squeeze in the publicly traded firms featuring the most negativity by major hedge funds has at least temporarily worked wonders. But the huge downfall in these apparent rags-to-riches-to-rags leaves a question mark on vitality.
Obviously, that’s not the case with AMD stock. Over the trailing five years, shares have gained nearly 4,350%. Better yet, these profits were sustained, sparking fundamental changes in the semiconductor industry. Today, you might be able to get away with calling Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) the poor man’s AMD. It used to be the opposite way around.
Curiously, though, AMD stock isn’t off to the most auspicious start this year. While the situation could change by the time you read this, the fact is, in January, AMD shed more than 7% of market value.
Interestingly, InvestorPlace contributor Chris Tyler noted the pensiveness in the price action of AMD stock. While Tyler notes the fundamental strengths of a core holding like Advanced Micro, there are some negative signs to watch out for.

Personally, I see shares going either way. But that’s not the topic at hand here. Instead, I believe AMD offers an interesting case as a barometer for Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD). Anyone interested in cryptocurrencies should consider the compelling data below.
Why AMD Stock May Be Screaming ‘Buy’ for Bitcoin
First, let me get something out of the way. I’m a big believer in the increased integration of cryptocurrencies and its disruptive potential. So, when I say that AMD stock is a barometer for Bitcoin, there is an element here that appears self-serving. Definitely, I benefit when the crypto complex does well, so I just want to disclose this in the spirit of full transparency.
Nevertheless, I believe the technical phenomenon speaks for itself. It appears that ahead of two major waves in the Bitcoin price (along with other cryptocurrencies), AMD stock jumped first.
You’ll recall that Bitcoin really captured the public’s imagination as a potential digital safe haven, a benchmark of value for a new generation of investors back in 2017. In March of that year, BTC could be bought for roughly $1,000. In December, it averaged around $14,000, but hit a then all-time high of nearly $20,000.
Source: Chart by Josh Enomoto
But before that craze, AMD stock had a tremendous rally in 2016. And between August 2016 and February 2017, AMD shares nearly doubled, from $7.40 to $14.46. Afterward, shares began to correct, while Bitcoin went on its 2017 moonshot rally.
Let’s fast forward to September 2019. Back then, AMD stock averaged just under $29. Later, in August 2020, it reached an average price of $90.82, yet another robust and remarkable rally. However, this apparently signaled the present Bitcoin rally, which saw an average price of under $11,000 in September 2020 skyrocket to $35,500 in January and early February.
Admittedly, you can write this off as a coincidence. Certainly, I wouldn’t suggest buying an asset based exclusively on technical phenomenon. You have to consider the broader fundamental picture and understand the risk-reward profile before diving in.
Nevertheless, it does give encouragement to those who are “HODL”-ing cryptocurrencies, as the kids say.
Speaking of Fundamentals
While we’re on the topic of fundamentals, I should note that there is a logical case for why AMD stock seemingly is signaling a buy for Bitcoin. As you know, AMD, along with rival Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a favorite manufacturer of crypto-mining GPUs (graphics processing units) among hardcore blockchain enthusiasts.
I discussed this point in greater detail for an article on Canaan (NASDAQ:CAN). In a nutshell, the difficulty or the energy spent on cracking algorithmic problems to extract blockchain reward tokens goes up or down depending on underlying market conditions.
Theoretically, a lower difficulty should always precede higher cryptocurrency prices. It suggests that true advocates recognize the fundamental opportunity of this sector and are advantaging lower mining difficulty in anticipation of a massive price spike.
That would imply more sales of AMD processors, which should lift its stock price. And the increasing engagement of cryptocurrencies eventually results in the entire sector mooning.
At least, that’s what I like to tell myself.

STOCKHOLM, Feb 3 (Reuters) - Automotive technology group Veoneer VNE.N, VNEsdb.ST said on Wednesday it expects organic sales growth of over 25% this year as it posted a slightly smaller-than-expected fourth-quarter operating loss.
Veoneer, which competes with companies such as Aptiv APTV.N, Bosch, Continental CONG.DE and Mobileye INTC.O, was hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic earlier in 2020 as the car industry saw production halted in many markets by widespread lockdowns.
The firm, which saw positive organic sales growth for the first time in the fourth quarter, also said it expects increased order intake this year, and its operating loss to shrink in 2021 from 2020.
""The company expects to arrive to a sustainable operating profit and positive free cash flow during 2023,"" it said in a statement.
The Sweden-based firm reported a $77 million operating loss for the fourth quarter versus a $72 million loss a year earlier, and compared to a mean analysts' forecast of $83 million in a poll published by the company.
Sweden-listed shares in the company, a maker of vision systems, radars and software for advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS), rose 3.7% at 1126 GMT.
Veoneer said last month that it expected a return to organic sales growth in the fourth quarter of 2020, with growth accelerating in 2021.

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.

Environmental criteria include considerations like the environmental impact of the company's products and services, as well as the company's efficiency in terms of its use of energy and resources.

2021-02-01 00:00:00+00:00,7 Hot Stocks That Are Cooling Off ,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/7-hot-stocks-that-are-cooling-off-2021-02-01,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Broader markets as well as some of the darlings of Wall Street have been making record highs in January. However, as the earnings season continues, investors might be getting ready to take some risk off the table and book profits following the massive rally of recent months. Therefore today, we introduce seven hot stocks that may cool off in early 2021.
Market participants might at this stage contemplate how much worse the pandemic can get before its health and economic effects are behind us. As a result of the over-stretched valuations, many stocks have little margin of safety. Thus we might see wild swings in stock prices in the coming months.
Recent research led by Ruben Arevalo of the Polytechnic University of Valencia, Spain states, “Financial markets are complex and non-linear dynamic systems, so their predictions are really challenging.” Buy-and-hold retail investors should ideally not be concerned with the daily or weekly volatility in equity markets. Instead, they should concentrate on picking robust firms that are likely to create shareholder value for many quarters.
On the other hand, declines in the prices of robust hot stocks also provide investors with better entry points into some of the leading names. Therefore, it is helpful to keep an eye on profit-taking that might be happening in the markets.
With that information, here are seven hot stocks that we believe will take a breather in early 2021:
The Top 7 Hot Stocks to Buy for 2021’s Biggest Trends
EnerSys (NYSE:ENS) 
Enphase Energy (NASDAQ:ENPH)
Intel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC)
MongoDB (NASDAQ:MDB)
Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA)
Quantumscape (NYSE:QS)
Zscaler (NASDAQ:ZS)
Hot Stocks: EnerSys (ENS)

52-week range: $35.21 – $93.39
Dividend yield: 0.85%
First on this list of hot stocks is Reading, Pennsylvania-based EnerSys, which manufactures industrial batteries as well as related products, such as chargers, power equipment, outdoor cabinet enclosures, and battery accessories. It is one of the most important global names in stored energy solutions for industrial applications. 
In early November, EnerSys released Q2 results. Net sales were $708.4 million, a 7% YoY decrease. On a non-GAAP basis, adjusted net earnings per diluted share were $1.00, representing a 18.7% decline YoY. Its gross profit margin was steady at 25%.
CEO David M. Shaffer commented, “Our Energy Systems business held up well as telecommunications operators continue to expand their capacity and continue their 5G rollouts in a measured fashion… To offset the year over year reduction in revenue, we have taken multiple initiatives to flex our operational expenses. These expenses not only decreased by nearly $13 million for the quarter from the prior year, but as a percentage of sales it improved by 60 bps.”
Although I like the company and its prospects, the shares would offer better value around $85 or even lower. 
Enphase Energy (ENPH)

52-week range: $21.49 – $222.43
Dividend yield: N/A
Fremont, California-based Enphase Energy provides energy management solutions with an emphasis on microinverter systems for the solar photovoltaic industry. Its semiconductor-based microinverter system converts direct current (DC) electricity to alternating current (AC) electricity. 
According to the most recent quarterly metrics, revenue was $178.5 million in the third quarter of 2020, compared to $180.1 million in the prior year period. Non-GAAP net income was $41.8 million, compared to $39.5 million in the prior year period. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share remained the same as in the third quarter a year ago at 30 cents. Cash flow from operations was at $67.5 million. 
Management cited, “Demand for our core microinverter products rebounded strongly in the third quarter of 2020. We experienced record sell-through from distribution to installers, resulting in channel inventory slightly below the low end of our typical target range.”
ENPH stock’s forward P/E and P/S ratios are 142.93x and 40.80x, making the valuation overstretched. The share price had an amazing run-up in 2020, reflecting strong investor enthusiasm in the alternative energy space.
7 Tech Stocks That Could Be the Future FAANG 
I believe that over the next decade, hot stocks like Enphase is well positioned to grow. But it might not be possible to maintain the current share price momentum in the short-run. Investors should not be surprised to see wild swings in stock price in the coming months.
Intel (INTC)

52-week range: $43.61 – $69.29
Dividend yield: 2.5%
Santa Clara, California-based Intel is the largest chipmaker globally, with products ranging from personal computing to data centers. It delivers computer, networking, data storage, and communications platforms. The company is currently the market-leading provider of central processing units (CPUs) for laptops, desktops, and servers.
Intel released Q4 results on Jan. 21. Fourth-quarter revenue was $20 billion, down 1% YoY. Non-GAAP net income was $6.2 billion, down 6% YoY. It delivered earnings per share of $1.52 on a non-GAAP basis, down 10% YoY. In 2020, the company generated a record $35.4 billion cash from operations and $21.1 billion of free cash flow during the quarter.
CEO Bob Swan said, “We significantly exceeded our expectations for the quarter, capping off our fifth consecutive record year. Demand for the computing performance Intel delivers remains very strong and our focus on growth opportunities is paying off. Intel is in a strong strategic and financial position as we make this leadership transition and take Intel to the next level.”
In general the shares have underperformed both the semiconductors sector and the broader U.S. equity market over the past years. Yet, since the start of 2021, the shares are up about 10%. There might soon be some short-term profit-taking in the shares. A decline of about 5% would improve the margin of safety.
MongoDB (MDB)

52-week range: $93.81 – $399.00
Dividend yield: N/A
New York-based MongoDB, Inc. is a database platform for high volume data storage. Its primary subscription package is MongoDB Enterprise Advanced. Users have access to tools that make querying and indexing possible and easy. Management has been aiming to take advantage of digitalization trends and the growth in machine learning, artificial intelligence (AI), and Internet-of-the-Things (IoT). 
MangoDB announced Q3 metrics in early December. Revenue came at $150.8 million, an increase of 38% YoY. Subscription revenue was $144.1 million, an increase of 39% YoY. Services revenue was $6.7 million, up 19% YoY. Non-GAAP net loss was $18.2 million or 31 cents per share, compared to $14.6 million, or 26 cents per share, in the prior year period. 
CEO Dev Ittycheria remarked, “MongoDB continued to perform at a high level in the third quarter, highlighted by revenue growth that was well ahead of our expectations. With the recent announcement of multi-cloud clusters, MongoDB Atlas is the first cloud database to enable an application to run simultaneously across multiple cloud providers.”

The company has a market capitalization (cap) of $21 billion. Thus, it has the potential to grow a lot more in the new decade. However, in the short-run, the shares might take a pause.
Nvidia (NVDA)

52-week range: $180.68 – $589.07
Dividend yield: 0.12%
Santa Clara, California-based Nvidia is one of the most important chip stocks, focusing on personal computer (PC) graphics, graphics processing unit (GPU) and artificial intelligence (AI). The group operates through two main segments: GPU and Tegra Processor. Its GPU product brands are aimed at specialized markets, such as gamers, designers, AI, big data, and cloud-based visual computing.
In Q3, Nvidia reported record revenue of $4.73 billion, up 57% from $3.01 billion from a year earlier. Non-GAAP net income was $1.83 billion, a 66% increase YoY. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were $2.91, up 63%. Free cash flow was $806 million, representing a 48% decline YoY.
During the quarter, data center revenue saw a 162% increase, thanks to increased use by cloud companies. Also, during the lockdowns in 2020, gaming has increased, contributing to sales figures. Moreover, telecoms are beginning to depend on Nvidia’s processors in their 5G infrastructures.
CEO Jensen Huang cited, “NVIDIA is firing on all cylinders, achieving record revenues in Gaming, Data Center and overall… We are continuing to raise the bar with NVIDIA AI. We swept the industry AI inference benchmark, and our customers are moving some of the world’s most popular AI services into production, powered by NVIDIA technology.”
NVDA stock’s forward P/E and P/S ratios are 84.9x and 21.97x, respectively. These metrics suggest an over-stretched valuation level. As the company gets ready to release Q4 results in the coming weeks, profit-taking could hit the shares.
Quantumscape (QS)
Source: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com
52-week range: $9.74 – $132.73
Dividend yield: N/A  
San Jose, California-based QuantumScape was formed as a result of a reverse merger with Kensington Capital Acquisition Corp., a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC). The merger completed in November 2020. QuantumScape develops solid-state lithium-metal batteries for electric vehicles (EVs). These batteries are considered to be a holy-grail technology, promising longer ranges and faster recharging times.
It has been a wild ride for QS investors since November. The stock increased almost 80% in December, then lost about 50% in value in January. 
Many industry experts agree that the battery technology has much potential. Yet it remains several years away from mass production. The company aims to begin commercialization in 2024. Even with Volkswagen (OTCMKTS:VWAGY) as a strategic partner, it will take at least a few years for QuantumScape to turn any profit.

A volatile stock combines high expectations and a potential high return with high risk. QS stock definitely fits the description.  Potential investors should have a long time horizon to hold QS shares. I expect volatility in stock price to continue. At today’s price of nearly $47 per share, there’s plenty of time to buy at a potentially better price. 
Zscaler (ZS)
Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com
52-week range: $35 – $218
Dividend yield: N/A
Last up on this list of hot stocks is San Jose, California-based Zscaler, a leading player in cloud-based security. It offers two principal cloud services: Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA) and Zscaler Private Access (ZPA). Management has been taking full advantage of the rapid growth in the cybersecurity industry, especially as a result of the rapid digitalization trends of last year.
In early December, the group released Q1 FY21 results. Revenue grew 52% YoY to $142.6 million. Non-GAAP net income was $20.0 million, compared to $4.9 million a year ago. Non-GAAP net income per share was 14 cents, compared to 4 cents in Q1 FY20. Free cash flow was $42.2 million. A year ago, it had been $9.4 million.
CEO Jay Chaudhry cited, “Our customers are accelerating their digital transformation, and this drove our strong first quarter results. Our visibility and business momentum remain strong, and we are pleased to increase our fiscal year guidance.”
ZS stock’s forward P/E and P/S ratios are 588.24x and 54.39x, respectively. These are high valuation levels. Between now and the next earnings release that is expected in over a month, investors should be ready to see some profit-taking in the shares.
