2021-06-07 00:00:00+00:00,"Is Marvell Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRVL) Trading At A 21% Discount?",MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/is-marvell-technology-inc.-nasdaq%3Amrvl-trading-at-a-21-discount-2021-06-07,,,"In this article we are going to estimate the intrinsic value of Marvell Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRVL) by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.
Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model.
The calculation
We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.
Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:
10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate
2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030
Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$629.1m US$851.4m US$1.44b US$1.90b US$2.33b US$2.72b US$3.05b US$3.33b US$3.57b US$3.76b
Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x8 Analyst x2 Analyst x2 Est @ 31.81% Est @ 22.87% Est @ 16.6% Est @ 12.22% Est @ 9.15% Est @ 7% Est @ 5.5%
Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.3% US$586 US$739 US$1.2k US$1.4k US$1.6k US$1.8k US$1.9k US$1.9k US$1.9k US$1.9k
(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)
Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$15b
The second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.3%.
Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2030 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$3.8b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (7.3%– 2.0%) = US$72b
Present Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$72b÷ ( 1 + 7.3%)10= US$35b
The total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$50b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$48.7, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 21% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.
NasdaqGS:MRVL Discounted Cash Flow June 7th 2021
The assumptions
Now the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Marvell Technology as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.3%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.132. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.
Next Steps:
Although the valuation of a company is important, it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value?

The chipmaker is on track to deliver solid results on the back of multiple growth drivers such as 5G wireless networks, data centers, and storage. And this is just one reason that investors looking to take advantage of hot tech trends should be buying Marvell Technology right now.
Let's look at two reasons this chipmaker is a solid bet.
Image source: Getty Images
1. Marvell Technology is set to grow at higher rates
Marvell's lucrative end markets helped it finish fiscal 2021 on a high. The chipmaker's revenue was up 10% last year, while its adjusted earnings increased 41%. The good news for Marvell investors is that its growth rate is expected to jump.
The company originally called for $800 million in revenue for the first quarter of fiscal 2022. It anticipates adjusted earnings of $0.27 per share at the midpoint of its guidance range. Marvell delivered $0.18 per share in earnings on revenue of $694 million in the year-ago quarter. So revenue could increase 15% year over year and earnings may jump 50% if it hits the midpoint of its guidance, indicating acceleration in its growth.
But don't be surprised to see Marvell exceed its own expectations, since it completed the acquisition of Inphi toward the end of the quarter. Last year, Marvell said that the $10 billion Inphi acquisition would complement its data center and 5G businesses, adding that its addressable market would go up to $23 billion. The acquisition has also bumped Marvell's end-market growth to an annual rate of 12% while generating annual cost synergies of $125 million within 18 months of the deal being closed.
So Inphi's addition should ensure faster top- and bottom-line growth for Marvell in the coming years. This is evident from analysts' estimates, which call for nearly 40% more revenue in fiscal 2022 followed by a 20%-plus increase in fiscal 2023. Its annual earnings are expected to jump to $1.35 per share this fiscal year from $0.92 last year, followed by an increase to $1.86 next year.
All of this indicates that Marvell is set to transform into a high-growth company, and it won't be surprising to see it remain one for a long time to come.
2. Long-term catalysts should ensure sustained growth
Marvell's chips are used in the networking and storage markets, and both of them are sitting on substantial catalysts. The networking business produced 55% of the company's revenue in the fourth quarter and registered 16% year-over-year growth. Its impressive gain was driven by 5G, automotive, and the cloud. These three verticals more than doubled in revenue last year and accounted for a quarter of the company's total sales in fiscal 2021.
The good part is that the demand for chips in these verticals is expected to boom. For instance, 5G base-station deployments are forecast to grow at an annual rate of nearly 34% through 2028. This bodes well for Marvell's networking business because it supplies 5G baseband processors to the likes of Samsung and Nokia, which play a key role in the deployment of 5G networks across the globe.
Additionally, Marvell is going after the 5G massive multiple-input multiple-output market in collaboration with Analog Devices, which expects its 5G business to pick up the pace as the year progresses. This is another fast-growing market that's expected to clock annual increases of 35% through 2027. Meanwhile, Marvell says that its automotive business is on track for a breakout this year, driven by additional design wins and more business from existing customers.
Similarly, the storage market that accounts for 41% of total revenue and recorded 10% annual growth in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 is also sitting on secular catalysts. Storage capacities have increased consistently over the years, and that trend is unlikely to change. IDC estimates that the installed base of storage capacity across the globe could rise at an annual rate of 17.8% through 2024.
Marvell supplies controllers that are used in enterprise solid-state drives (SSDs) and hard-disk drives (HDDs). Its storage accelerators are meant to help data centers and cloud service providers efficiently scale up their infrastructure, so don't be surprised to see them remain in strong demand.
In all, it is easy to see that Marvell's growth drivers are here to stay for a long time, which explains why analysts expect it to clock 35%-plus annual earnings growth for the next five years. So investors looking to add a growth stock to their portfolios shouldn't ignore Marvell Technology, which trades at just 25 times forward earnings. But it may not be available at an attractive valuation if shares shoot higher following its quarterly report on June 7.

Alison Southwick: This is Motley Fool Answers. I'm Alison Southwick, and I'm joined as always by Robert rules of order Brokamp, Personal Finance Expert here at The Motley Fool. Well listeners, get excited. I even skipped saying ""Hi"" to you. I'm so excited about today's guest. Well, how are you?
Robert Brokamp: That's OK. I'm fine, Alison. How are you?
Southwick: Okay, great. Get excited because the one and only, David Gardner, Co-founder and Chief Rule Breaker of The Motley Fool will be joining us for the next couple of episodes to share his guiding principles for investing success. This week will cover his six traits of a Rule Breaker stock. All that and more, on this week's episode of Motley Fool Answers.
So Bro, what's up?
Brokamp: Well, Alison, this past Saturday was the Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B) Annual Meeting and like the previous year, it was very different. Not a public gathering, but this year it was in L.A., so that Warren Buffett could do it with his partner, Charlie Munger. Munger being 97 years old, does not travel as much. Buffett however is a spray 90, so he was able to make the flight out there. They kicked it off and Buffett pointed out that they met 62 years ago, and at the time Munger was building a house, and just a few months before that Buffett had bought a house. 62 years later, they're both in the same houses. I've never seen Munger's house, but I've seen Buffett's. I walked around the neighborhood when I went to one of the annual meetings. It's definitely a nice house, nice neighborhood. Zillow values it as $1.3 million, don't know how accurate that is. It is the nicest house in this neighborhood, but most of the other houses were like $500,000, $600,000. He's not slumming it, but it's probably not what most people would expect from one of the richest people in the world. I just think it's one of the interesting things about Warren Buffett.
Buffett and Munger were joined by two other folks, Ajit Jain, who is the Vice President of Insurance Operations, and Greg Abel, who is the Vice President of everything but insurance and investments. Some news that came from the meeting today, a couple of days after the meeting, one of the questions during the meeting was whether there will be a point when Berkshire gets too large to manage. Charlie Munger replied that Berkshire can have all these different types of businesses because it's uniquely decentralized, which only works if you have the right culture. He added, ""Greg will keep the culture."" Well, some people thought that meant, ""So, we finally identified who's going to take over for Warren Buffett when he can't do the job anymore."" CNBC called Warren Buffett on Monday, two days after the meeting and they confirmed that, ""Yes, it is now official Greg Abel will take over for Warren Buffett, at least if Buffett were unable to do the job in the near future."" A lot of people expected that, but it's interesting, especially for me as a Berkshire shareholder, to know officially who is going to take over for Warren Buffett.
Buffett kicked off the meeting with an investing lesson, and it was geared specifically to people who are new to investing. He thinks that probably there are more people who just started investing in this past year than probably at any point. He and Munger took some swipes at Robinhood and they wanted to make sure that people knew what investing was really about. He put on the slide, the 20 biggest publicly traded companies in the world as of the end of March. You probably could guess what these companies are. Biggest is Apple, second is actually [...], I bet Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet. Most of them are from the United States, 13 of them are in the United States, a few from China. There's only one company that I actually have not heard of, I'm curious if you guys know about it, I'm not even sure I'm going to be able to pronounce it right, Kweichow Moutai. Have you guys ever heard of it?
Southwick: Not familiar, no.
Brokamp: Chinese companies.
Southwick: That's on me.
Brokamp: It was the largest beverage company in the world, and it's the largest distiller, and the most valuable spirit company even more valuable than Diageo. Anyways, I've never heard of it but regardless.
Southwick: Let's get to know this company.
Brokamp: [laughs] Here's the question that Buffett asked. ""Taking a look at these companies, how many of these do you think 30 years from now are going to still be among the top 20?"" Everyone can come up with their own idea of what some of these companies will be, whether they'll still be the biggest. Then he said, ""Well, to get an idea, let's look back 30 or so years, a little bit more than 30 actually."" He put up a chart, or a table of the biggest companies in the world as of 1989. Do you want to take a guess on how many companies that were the biggest in '89 are still among the 20 biggest?
Southwick: Five, I don't know.
Brokamp: The answer is zero.
Southwick: Zero? Man, I thought there had to be some.
Brokamp: No.
Southwick: Okay.
Brokamp: In fact, not only is it zero, but 13 of the top 20 were Japanese companies, the four biggest were Japanese banks, only six of them were American companies and they were Exxon, GE, IBM, AT&T, Philip Morris, and Merck, not known for being great investments these days. In fact, since 1989, the S&P 500 has returned almost 1,400%, Exxon 400%, and GE just 270%, and that's just price return not including dividends. What were the lessons that Buffett was trying to impart? First of all, it's just not easy to pick stocks. You might think that you know what's going to be the most valuable company 10, 20, 30 years from now, but it's actually very difficult to predict that. He actually pointed out during his presentation that there were more than 2,000 companies that entered the car business at some point in the 1900s, even companies like DuPont and Maytag and Allstate made cars, which I didn't know about, but now of course there are just a handful of car companies and some of those have gone through bankruptcies.
Obviously, today in this episode and next week as well, we're going to have full Co-Founder David Gardner talk about the criteria he looks for in a promising investment, and he has an outstanding record. But as he'll explain, you have to be prepared for many of your investments to be disappointments, which is why diversification is important. Which gets to Buffett's second point, something he emphasizes every year, and that is, for many people, you might as well just go with an S&P 500 index fund. As he said, the main thing to do is just be aboard the ship. He does express preference for the S&P 500 index fund, I think a total stock market index fund is a little bit better, it's more diversified you get mid-cap stocks and small-cap stocks, which historically have better returns. At least that's what I always say and then I'm like, ""Am I right about this?"" I look back at the returns for the oldest total stock market index fund, which is from Vanguard, came out in 1992, I'm like, ""Has it outperformed the S&P 500 index fund?"" The answer is yes, but not by so much.
So if you look back in 1992, if you invested $10,000 in the total stock market index fund, you'd have $174,000 today. In the S&P 500 Index fund, you'd have $168,000. So you'd definitely have a few thousand more. Then thirdly, I think this illustration brings up a question of international diversification. You could look at how things have changed over the last 30 years in one of two ways. You could look at this as evidence that you don't need international stocks. Look what happened to people who invested outside the U.S. Or you could look at this and think whoever's on top doesn't stay on top forever. International stocks are great in the '80s, U.S. stock great in the '90s. International stocks did better in the first decade of the 2000s, U.S. stocks have done better the last decade. So who knows what's going to happen over the next decade? Buffett didn't really address this, he does express his preference for U.S. stocks, but Berkshire does own some international companies. As far as I'm concerned, I think it's certainly worth considering having 15%, maybe even as high as 30% of your equity allocation in international stocks. Add that to your favorite stock picks, maybe add in some index funds for good measure, and 30 or more years from now, I think you'll be a much wealthier person. That Alison, is what's up.
[...]
Southwick: David Gardner, the man, the myth, the co-founder of The Motley Fool, thank you for joining us.
Gardner: It's a delight to join you and if it's a myth, which I don't think it is, I hope it's not scythian. Talking like an English major. Thank you.
Southwick: Hopefully, this episode won't be like pushing a boulder up a hill. We want to be as easy as possible for you. We have gained a lot of new listeners to the show this year and so we thought this would be a great opportunity for them to get to know you and get to know your philosophy for investing, so that we can help set them up for success early. But before we get started, I wanted to take a brief trip on the way back machine, because it was right around this time of year, roughly 27 years ago, that The Motley Fool was being conceived in a backyard shed. Maybe six blocks from where I sit here in my living room. Can you take us back, David?
Gardner: Still brings these smiles in my face and sure I can, Alison. One job that I had before The Fool, I was writing for a financial newsletter. Louis Rukeyser was a personality on PBS. He had the longest-running show on PBS 30+ years. It was called Wall Street Week with Louis Rukeyser and I was writing for the financial newsletter. But this isn't blaming Louis or anything, it just wasn't a great job. It was creatively detonating. I would write pieces for the newsletter and they would come back edited with all the color and humor stripped out. I didn't like the job. After only six months, now a married young person, but actually having not sought a job for the first year out of college, I'm now 25 with no prospects of getting hired by anybody because I couldn't even hold one job with Louis Rukeyser for a year. It was time to start something and we started the Motley Fool. I pulled the name from Shakespeare Act 2, Scene 7, As you'd like it, ""A fool, a fool, I see a fool in the forest, a Motley Fool."" It's a rather nondescript quote except for the great phrase, The Motley Fool. Motley, of course, being the ragtag garments worn by court Jester.
What a delightful thought it was to think that we could challenge conventional wisdom as Fools have done for centuries. But in this case, focus it on money. We started the Motley Fool newsletter, it was for money, it was a $48 year subscription, and the only people who would be willing to pay us $48 a year back then, were not our friends and peers who probably didn't trust us and we're wondering what the heck we are doing, it was our parents' friends who felt sorry for us and floated The Motley Fool through its first few months. The big moment for us was we pulled an April Fool's joke. It was April 1st of 1994, Robert and Alison. At that time, a lot of people were starting to use this new medium, which wasn't even called the Internet yet. The World Wide Web, that phrase wouldn't show up for a couple of years. But they were starting to use it to pump and dump penny stocks. We saw this especially on prodigies, for those who remember that ill-fated long ago online service. We made up a penny stock and we got people excited about it through a fake account that was hyping it and we pulled a great joke online. The Wall Street Journal and Forbes picked that up, wrote us up. America Online came to us, at the time they were the big dog online. They said, ""Hey, we think whatever your Motley Fool newsletters, let's have lunch and let's talk about maybe opening that on our new service, AOL,'' which was still also in its near infancy. That was really how The Motley Fool started on August 4th of 1994, our first day on AOL. Alison, our first issue ever was July of 1993. Somewhere in April or May right around this time of year, we were coming up with these ideas and I think we were probably laid on our first couple deadlines, so it all got pushed into July and that's when we launched.
Southwick: Now, your title is Chief Rule Breaker. You talk about the traits of a Rule Breaker stock. You lean into this phrase, Rule Breaker. Why is that?
Gardner: I think it's because at the heart of Foolishness, if you think about it, it is going against conventional wisdom. I think in a lot of ways, Rule Breaking is consonant with being a Fool. In the context of investing, there are lots of ways to break the rules. But in the context of investing, I think I inherited a lot of the perceived truths of how to invest. I was taught those as a little kid, but I started to decide some of them aren't actually right. I started to challenge some of those notions. A lot of people would say, a company has to have earnings before our investment club would ever think about that stock, or we would never pay over 25 times earnings of P/E, price to earnings ratio of 25, we would never overpay for any company that's overvalued. A lot of people had those rules in their head, so I thought, I think the way to win this game, to beat the market, to beat the market averages and a lot of Wall Street's wisdom is in fact to subvert these received truths is to break the rules and establish some new ones. I think we're going to talk some today about what some of those new rules are, that indeed I've written about for more than 20 years and been guided by and still use the exact same set of traits. I think that we're going to go over today in our book 23 years ago. Here I am, 23 years later, using them and they have beaten the market. I'm really happy to say, the song Shit I've been seeing off of has not changed and it has been wildly successful.
Southwick: All right. Well then, let's go through the song lyric by lyric then. Shall we?
Gardner: You sing, I'll just give the lyrics. You can sing. Bro can sing.
Southwick: Yeah, Bro is going to sing for us.
Gardner: Bro can dance, I'll say that much. Our producer, Rick Engdahl, can sing and play instruments. If you want to post-produce something that really surprises me, I'm excited about that, but I'll just do the talking part.
Southwick: That sounds fair enough. All right, David, then let's get to it because you have six traits of a Rule Breaker stock that you are going to walk us through here today.
Gardner: Thank you. Yes. Trait No. 1 is, top dog and first mover in an important emerging industry. Now, a lot of those phrases are loaded and worth noting. Top dog, we're talking about the companies that are the leaders. Sticking with our dog analogy, if you're not the lead husky, the view never changes. We've often said that's true in the Iditarod, it's also true in business. I love to find the companies that are the lead huskies because they can take our sled off into crazy interesting places. If, on the other hand, you're just following, it's not nearly as interesting. The Rule Beakers are top dogs. They're also usually first movers. They're the companies that dreamed up Jeff Bezos, e-commerce before most people would realize it would be a thing and he was just selling books back in the day and things have changed since then. A lot of people, by the way, doubted that e-commerce would even work. They said, ''Who's going to give their credit card over the Internet, that won't work.'' That was some of the skepticism we were greeted with when we picked Amazon at $3.21 a share in 1997 and still holding.
Then, an important emerging industry. We're looking for the industries that are going to shape the future and the earlier we can figure that out together, the better. I've often applied something I call the snap test, which is, if you could snap your fingers overnight and the company you're looking at or the industry you're looking at disappeared, would anyone notice? Would anyone care? Now probably someone would notice in every case, if like Thanos from Avenger End Wars, you snapped your fingers and an entire company or industry disappeared, but how many people would really care? I don't think a lot of people would miss their cable company very much. I'm not sure a lot of people would care, but if you snapped your fingers and Tesla disappeared, a lot of people would notice, and a lot of people would care. That's the snap test and that helps me stay focused on making sure we're looking at the important emerging industries and companies. In conclusion on this one, if there were only one trait that I could be guided by with all my investing of the six recovering today, this would be the one. I lead with it because I think it's the most important. You are fishing in a stocked pond if you just focus your investing on these companies, and the remarkable thing about that stock pond is that not many other people are fishing there, which is part of the reason it's magical and it works.
Southwick: Why aren't people fishing there? What is the conventional wisdom counter to this one?
Gardner: I think for a lot of people, they think buy low, sell high. They think they have to find this obscure cryptocurrency or Penny stock that no one else knows about and it's hidden and they found it and it's going to go to the moon. Well, those things rarely ever do go to the moon. Once in a blue moon, they might. But I prefer to stay focused on the great companies. Again, ironically, since a lot of them look overvalued, wait am I stealing from a future trait? Since a lot of them look overvalued, people tend to think, well, I wouldn't buy that one now, it's already done it so well. They forget, in conclusion, that most of these important emerging industries are innovation-driven. The company that's already the top dog is probably going to keep innovating. But because you can't see that, because you're taking it on faith, a lot of people are not willing to go fish in that risky-looking pond.
Southwick: Ironically. It's the biggest stable companies that are like, ''I don't want to go there.''
Gardner: It is. Especially, in context of these other five traits we're going to cover. When you put those all together, you end up understanding why a lot of people never do buy the best companies of their time.
Southwick: Let's move on to your next trait.
Gardner: Trait No. 2 is a sustainable competitive advantage. Now, that can be measured many different ways. Sometimes patent protection, if you're thinking about pharmaceutical companies that come up with a great drug and then are protected for 20 years or so for what they've invented, but I also think about just having the visionary, having the smartest people in the room. That's a great, sustainable competitive advantage. Mark Zuckerberg started our company, not your social media company, out of his Harvard dorm room, so I'm going to stick with Zuck. Now, I realize a lot of people are not big fans these days of Facebook in part because it's gotten so big. That means it's been an incredible investment from the outset or even from it being a public company. But that sustainable competitive advantage is so important because we're investing for at least three years, if not three decades. In a world that's gone trading where most mutual funds don't own, on December 31st, the stocks they had at the start of the year on January 1st, 70%-100% of those positions have changed. You and I can break the rules by staying focused on the long term playing the long game, the only game that counts for me. Therefore, sustainable competitive advantage is so important.
Southwick: What is a company that really exemplifies this for you?
Gardner: So many of the companies that I have invested in. All of the companies we're going to be talking about today through these six traits we're covering, they've risen generally 10 times or more for me. I'd like to really learn from my winners, not learn too well from our losers. That's another way to break the rules by the way, so many people think they should study what is lost for them. They should look at all the downsides of their life and learn lessons. As a Fool, I like to look at all the upsides and what's working and let's build from there. I can pull dozens of stocks to illustrate this. But how about Etsy? Etsy is a great example of a sustainable competitive advantage. You think, how could Etsy possibly survive in an Amazon lead world, and yet it is flourishing because it's Amazon proof in a lot of ways. On Amazon, you can buy something that anyone else can buy on Amazon, and I love Amazon for that reason. On Etsy, you can buy something that you can't find anywhere else but Etsy, and that is a sustainable competitive advantage.
Southwick: We'll probably get into this more later in your future trait, but how do you tell if a leader is truly visionary but also strategic and smart about it? Because I could argue the founder of WeWork was pretty visionary, but then that ended up just collapsing. How do you evaluate vision?
Gardner: Yeah. First of all, I think time always goes to believing in the vision of people who've dreamed it and built it. Dream it, build it. That is the story of business. That is why so many jobs are created and so much innovation, especially in the U.S., has happened because somebody had a dream. Even the founder of WeWork, a stock that I would never have bought if it was public, maybe these days it's worth looking at, if and when it does come public, it's changed some. But even that company, you have to respect the scale that was achieved. There was a great idea there. It wasn't a great business model. He might have gone a little crazy, but you know what? I'm also willing to lose and be wrong, and that's also important here.
But to answer the question, I think that visionaries are usually identifiable because they have started with the seed of something, and think about all that it takes to bring them to become public companies one day. You have to find real customers with a real product or service that beat a lot of competition and you created forward momentum. You probably had a culture, I hope, that people loved to be part of as employees or as consumers. I think that these are often great signs of the visionaries of our time, and usually these are founder led companies. Usually, we recognize the names of the person who started this or that company as opposed to, sorry, to bash cable companies again, but Comcast or Spectrum these days. Who's even running that? Who's behind it? Who owns shares? At this point, they are often big institutional led companies that don't have an evident visionary still working within that business.
Southwick: We're actually in the process of getting rid of Comcast. We're hoping this 5G works out for us.
Gardner: I still like my files, but I'm not saying I'm a huge fan of Verizon.
Southwick: Yeah. You're not going to go buy a Verizon T-shirt and be really proud to be a Verizon customer.
Gardner: That's right. I also want to say, Verizon employs hundreds of thousands of people. It is a very important company today, but that doesn't mean you and I have to invest in it. I'd like to focus my investing on the real up and comers. Not the rule makers, if you will. I love the Rule Breakers who come along and disrupt the rule makers.
Southwick: Let's move on to your next trait of a Rule Breaker stock.
Gardner: Trait No. 3. This is the first time that we really hit one that is about the stock, not the company, and that's pretty controversial, which is in part, I think, why it works. Trait No. 3 is that the stock has strong past price appreciation. Now, you'd think again, in a world where so many people here buy low, sell high. Four of the most harmful words ever invented to misguide generations of mom-and-pop investors, individual investors like me. You think that you would never want to find a stock with strong past price appreciation. Why would you want to find something that's already up? Before I picked Amazon, it had doubled in the six weeks leading up to me picking Amazon. That was rather painful at the time. I was researching it, I was writing it up, and the stock doubled, and yet it's done pretty well since. I started to realize with older eyes looking backward that that was actually a great sign, a signal that we should pay attention to, because when a stock is doing really well, it tells you great things.
First of all, it tells you the market recognizes what's happening. You're not sitting there hoping that somebody will finally discover or think that the stock that you own is a great company. It's already quite evident to a lot of people that it's going up. The second thing that it tells you is the company is probably operating pretty effectively. They're going through one quarterly earnings report after another where people might want to bash them or sell off their stock after hours because they didn't quite hit their numbers. If a stock is consistently winning, that is an excellent sign. Instead of buying low, selling high, it has you buying high and trying not to sell, which is a much more successful approach to investing, and that is Rule Breaker investing.
Southwick: This one, I feel very strongly because it's so easy to think I already missed it. I already missed the boat on Amazon. When I started at The Motley Fool, even 10 years ago, I had the same feelings, I already missed the boat on Amazon. Netflix, I've already missed my shot. I'll just look around for something else. But of course, if I had and I did sometimes invest in these stocks, I would have still done very well in the last 10 years. But at the time I was like no. I had to just believe that it still had room to grow. This is one that personally, I had to learn to break the rule on.
Gardner: I'm glad that you have, Alison. I truly believe the most human beings, even those who love the stock still don't get this. That leaves all the other human beings who haven't even understood the stock market yet. Most people would never think that this would work, which is why it is Rule Breaker investing. Amazon looked overvalued in 1997 and 2002, 2007, 2012, 2017. People would still be saying it's overpriced in 2022. For over 25 years, it was the best stock of our time. That is really instructive. But here's another quick example. How about Lululemon Athletica? This is a stock that I first recommended in 2010. It's up nine or more times in value. At the time, it was trading at 53 times earnings and people were saying, ""Why would you overpay for yoga pants? I can get that much cheaper at X, Y, or Z,"" and it's up nine times in value. But at the time, it looked so overpriced. It had already done quite well as a public company, and that is a good sign.
Southwick: That provides a good segue to our next trait, because I feel like Lululemon has had its ups and downs on this next trait. I'll let you share with our listeners what it is.
Gardner: Trait No. 4 is good management and smart backing. It's about the people. Because after all, products and services change. The industry in which these companies work and their competitive sets will change over time, but what usually doesn't change is what is responsible for all of the success or failure, and I think it's you and me. It's our fellow humans. It's the management team. It's the venture capitalists backing these early emerging companies. It is about the people. I mentioned earlier the importance of a sustainable competitive advantage. When you can have a founder who owns a lot of stock, it means a lot to him or her to actually own that company probably for their whole lives. That's a great sign that not only do you have a sustainable competitive advantage, but you've probably found good management and smart backing.
In a world where so many people think the way to figure out the stock market is numerical, it's about statistics, it's algorithms, it's big machines trading against each other, even as we're speaking right now. How could I be a little investor possibly competing against this? Turns out you have a much bigger advantage because most of those machines don't think about the people at all. They're looking for zigs and zags on stock charts. They're just hoping the next earnings report pops the stock. You and I are invested in the people and we're looking for somebody like Jensen Huang, right in the eye, one of the more underrated CEOs of our time, the Founder and CEO of Nvidia, which has been a monster stock winner for us at Motley Fool Stock Advisor. Or Activision Blizzard's Bobby Kotick, who basically bought into Activision Blizzard when it was nearly bankrupt, and has brought the company into prominence as one of the great video game companies of our time. It's about the people.
Southwick: This one reminds me of Buffett's quote about investing in companies that are so great, even an idiot could run them, because eventually an idiot will, or something like that. I'm paraphrasing. I'm butchering the quote. It reminds me of that quote because well, if I can get a company that actually is so awesome, but then actually have great management, that's exponential potential there to be an awesome stock.
Brokamp: The key with management is it usually stays in place. At bigger companies, let's just go ahead and bash, I don't know, Comcast, Spectrum.
Southwick: Let's just pull the name from the sky.
Gardner: Let's have Comcast, Spectrum, and Verizon all merged into mega Corp. Your cable company. Usually that person who rises to become CEO of that has worked his or her entire career to finally get to that point, let's say in their early 60s. They are imagining a big pay package and they're probably going to be there for how many years? I don't know, maybe three. They'll retire at 65 and somebody else will come on for his or her three or four year run, yet you and I can be invested in Jensen Huang for three decades or more. So yes, good management, smart backing, these things endure and that's why we want to be invested in them.
Southwick: Let's move onto our 5th trait of a Rule Breaker stock, David.
Gardner: Trait No. 5 is strong consumer appeal. We're talking here about brands. Generally a strong consumer brand if possible, but even companies that sell to other companies, so called business-to-business. Businesses can have good brands. Ultimately, the brand is a promise that you make to your customers that you need to fulfill everyday. It's really hard to do, especially at scale, when you think about a company like Apple, and think about how that brand has been created over the course of decades. Apple today is the No. 1 brand in the world by most surveys. It's been a wonderful long term holding for so many Motley Fool members and a huge winner for Motley Fool Stock Advisor. It's so instructive to me that the world's No. 1 brand has also been one of the world's best stocks, and the world's No. 1 brand is also the largest market capitalization. It's achieved the greatest size of all public companies worldwide. I hope all of us are studying and learning from that, but it doesn't just have to be the biggest brands. Here's a little brand that I loved back in the day, Marvel. Marvel, owned these days by another great brand, Disney, but stay focused on Marvel for a second.
Marvel had a whole fan base when it emerged out of near bankruptcy as a successful public company that was transitioning from comic books onto the silver screen. That first Spider-Man movie, a lot of people said, ""That's a fad. These superhero movies don't have staying power, this is not a thing, don't you remember Michael Keaton's Batman back in the 90's or 80's or whatever it was, that's not sustainable."" Yet as it turns out, Marvel has a great brand. Yeah, Marvel greater than [...] DC, sorry. Marvel was and is a great brand. Now today, as I mentioned, Disney bought them out so we Marvel shareholders back in the day, today we're Disney shareholders, but guess what, we just slid from one great brand to another.
Trait No. 5, we have to look at the brands and ask, what are the best known companies? What are the best loved brands in the world? So many of our best stocks are those companies. I'm reminded here of the original route, the Latin route for the word invest. It's a beautiful word and I'm glad you're here learning it from us if you didn't already know. The word is investere. Investire is Latin for ""to put on the clothes"" or ""to wear the clothes."" If you know a phrase like Priestly Vestments, well, it's the same route, invest investments. It's to put on the clothes. My mental picture has always been sports fans because they go to the games and what do they do? They wear the jerseys, they've got their favorite players number or name on their back. Whether their team wins or loses that day, whether their team has a good season or not, and there will be ups and downs, they're going to keep that jersey on. That is exactly the same mental model that you and I should have. If we want to break the rules and beat Wall Street, we should stay focused on keeping the clothes on. You should love your stock, just like you love your home teams. You should be making your portfolio reflect your best vision for our future. Again, why is this breaking the rules when it seems like common sense? Well, as a wise man once said common sense ain't actually that common. Most people think that they need to jump in and jump out, driven by phrases like buy low, sell high. The third word right away has been thinking about when they should sell, and we've been much more successful when we remember the original Latin route for the word investere, put on the clothes.
Southwick: Be proud of the companies that you invest in. Then you're more likely to hold onto them, then you're more likely to be excited when they do well, when you're not yet financially invested, but you're like, it's more a reflection of you and how you want the world to be.
Gardner: Hell, yeah. As a friend of mine was recently reminding me since we're all so busy in life and people ask us to do this thing or that thing. There's so many choices we have to make, especially as adults. My friend said, ""If it's not a hell yeah, it's a hell no."" Sometimes I like to throw the hell yeah out there to remember, let's stay focused on the things that we really are most passionate about. Let's say focus on the hell yeah companies too.
Southwick: Yeah. All right, let's move on to our final trait.
Gardner: Trait No. 6, the secret sauce of Rule Breaker investing, especially in light of the other five. Trait No. 6 is that the stock be widely perceived as overvalued, especially by the financial media. Now for new investors in particular, this one seems crazy, which by the way is why it works. This one seems crazy because you would think if on the front cover of The Wall Street Journal or the news weekly Barron's, or on CNBC, if they're saying this stock is so overvalued, you would think, well that's not the fishing pond, I'm going to be fishing in the overvalued stocks. But here's the beauty of why this is the secret sauce for Rule Breaker investing. Because to review, if you can find the top dog and first mover in an important emerging industry with a sustainable competitive advantage, strong pass price appreciation, good management and smart backing, and strong consumer appeal, and everybody thinks that stock is so overvalued, you're onto something special because yeah, it probably does look overvalued in the very near-term, but we're not playing the near term game. If everybody thinks something is overvalued they're on the sidelines. They're like, ""I would never buy Amazon, I would never buy Netflix. Do you realize that Netflix is mailing people DVDs? This is back in the day. Blockbusters going to crush Netflix. I could just drop off the movie at my local blockbuster."" People are going to think it's overvalued, but as these companies go out and execute and win, all of those skeptics who stayed out of the stock, one by one, will all of a sudden have their Amazon Prime subscription.
Then a couple of years later, they'll be like, ""You know what, I am going to buy Amazon stock."" Warren Buffett just said a few years ago, one of those great regrets was he never bought Amazon. Well we've owned it for almost 25 years now because so many people thought it was overvalued all the way through. As those skeptics convert not just to believers, but to shareholders, that's what drives the great walls of worry, which visually describe the ascent of these stock prices over time, as skeptics become not just believers, but shareholders.
Southwick: Not to keep harping on Amazon here. I'm not harping, but not to keep using Amazon as an example here. But it's May of 1999 that Barron's ran that famous Amazon.bomb cover. At the time they were saying that Amazon was worth a remarkable $36 billion. I don't know what Amazon is worth today, [laughs] it's off the top of my head, but I have a feeling it's more than $36 billion. That was in 1999 that the media was saying that it's over, it's done.
Gardner: Amazon is worth $1.7 trillion today.
Southwick: A little more.
Gardner: These are all big numbers, but that is a huge huge win from $36 billion.
Southwick: Big number.
Gardner: It is worth pointing out in Barron's favor that within a couple of years, Amazon would get torched, but it wasn't Amazon's fault. The entire stock market, and frankly, the world trade center all came down. That was a horrible time and a lot of the weak hands a lot of the second and third movers among the dot-bombs back then didn't survive that era. Amazon sure did and so did some other great companies that we look back on as leaders today. I think about that a lot. I think it's important to remember that when companies get called out in the cover of Barron's as overvalued, Barron's might even be right in the near-term and yet they're writing for near term thinkers and near term actors. That's what drives most of the financial media and even more of the trading that happens every day on the stock market. Simply by playing the on-game, by breaking the rules of how convection works here, we can win wildly.
Southwick: All right, David. Well, that covers it for the six traits of a Rule Breaker stock. But of course, it takes more than just identifying a great stock to be a successful investor, which is why next week, I believe you'll be joining us to talk about your six habits of a Rule Breaker investor. Talking about what you as an investor need to do with your actions when you find these great stocks, when you identify these Rule Breaker stocks. That sound good?
Gardner: It sounds great, Alison, because it's one thing to find these great companies, but if you don't have the right mindset and the right habits then you might not do well with them. It's so important to me not just to tell you six traits of Rule Breaker stocks, but the six habits you need to develop if you want to be a Rule Breaker investor. By the way, not everybody has to, if what we just covered sounds insane to you, good news, there are other approaches to prospering with the stock market. Companies pay dividends, etc. There are lots of ways to beat the market. You just asked me to describe mine.
Southwick: It's worked pretty well for you. David, thank you so much for joining us and we'll see you here next week.
Gardner: Fool on!

2021-05-13 00:00:00+00:00,3 Stocks to Buy Even While Markets Are Wobbly,MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-stocks-to-buy-even-while-markets-are-wobbly-2021-05-13,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
It’s never fun to watch an extremely red day on Wall Street, but it has its upside. Besides, I was expecting it, so that makes it easier to trade through. Nevertheless, I am optimistic by nature. On bad days, I search for quality stocks to buy for the long term.
I specified my extended-term limit because I am not striving to find the perfect bottom. This is truer now than ever because there are dislocations in this market. There are dozens of great companies whose stocks have fallen into supports. Conversely, the S&P 500 weekly chart simply has one red candle. On that chart there are no signs of a correction, merely the start of a tough week. There still is an open gap to SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSEARCA:SPY) $400.
One red candle does not make for a correction, nor does it inspire going into stocks in force. For example, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) looks like it’s falling into a solid support level from the March lows. Normally this would inspire me to take some bullish positions but I haven’t yet. I fear that the S&P still has a lot of room to fall, especially that this is a weak season. The “sell in May” gang might have more action left in them. I don’t want to pick a fight with a meme if I can avoid it.
If I’m right and the indices continue lower, they would drag Apple down through no fault of its own. We often forget that our stocks have to trade within the collective market. Regardless of how good the one story is, I have to consider external influences.
Today my goal is to find three companies whose stocks have a good chance at finding footing. I am confident that these levels may not be the absolute bottoms but close enough. The three stocks to buy on this weakness are:
Zillow Group (NASDAQ:ZG)
Marvell Technology (NASDAQ:MRVL)
The Trade Desk (NASDAQ:TTD)
Stocks to Buy: Zillow Group (ZG)
Source: Charts by TradingView
It feels like eons ago that the world went through the financial crisis of 2008. At the heart of the problem was a real-estate bubble that burst in a big way. Zillow had only been about four years old back then. Somehow they managed to pull through the toughest test on the industry in modern times. This is testament to the competency of the management team.
In the last two years, they made more bold moves even into buying homes, not just reporting on them. They had doubters and the stock went through troubling times but they managed to pull through it. Last year, the pandemic crash took the stock down 70%. It quickly recovered that and increased the greens to +1,040%.
This all came to a crashing halt on February 16. They had just reported earnings and the investors liked what they heard. But the whole market corrected hard, especially the Nasdaq. For no specific reason, ZG stock fell 45% and is now trying to stabilize. Unfortunately, the indices are having another bout of selling this week, so the Zillow bulls have headwinds.
Their fundamentals suggest that any stock troubles are opportunities to buy. They tripled their revenues since 2017 into a $3 billion run rate. They now are sporting a positive net income for the trailing 12 months. While it’s not a cheap stock, it has a relatively modest price-to-sales cheaper than Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). Investors have made mistakes judging this company and I’ve pounced on those opportunities for years.
Marvell Technology (MRVL)
Source: Charts by TradingView
Next on the list of stocks to buy, Marvell shares had a terrible April and are starting May on an equally bad note. Wednesday, the stock fell another 6% after a similar drop the prior three days. In total, MRVL stock is now 25% off its highs and seemingly with no relief. Today, I will borrow the mantra from the most famous investor of all time. Warren Buffett believes that it’s best to buy when the rest are fearful.
Those who did this in March had fast and vast profits for their bravery. Now we can draw from their example and do the same with this. It’s basically a rinse-and-repeat scenario but it also has merits for other reasons. The MRVL $40 line has been in contention since last September. Back then it was a major failing point. Then finally, after two months of struggle, the bulls broke out from it.
Here comes the important bit. They successfully tested it for footing during the Nasdaq crash of March 5. Now we are going back into it, hence the attempt to catch it. My assumption from the charts is that the support will hold again. For that purpose it’s good to place a stop-loss level below to suit personal taste.
Fundamentally, I would be comfortable if MRVL fails to hold and I have to own it for a while. Management has the business in a position of power. They are riding the right trends so they have runway room for more successes. Management recently delivered reasons to expect stronger sales forecasts. They are promising a lot and that is infectious optimism. The price targets are still relatively reasonable. It will be hard to disappoint the owners of the stock without new black swans.
Stocks to Buy: The Trade Desk (TTD)
Source: Charts by TradingView
The TTD stock fell 50% from its highs just four months ago. The traditional “value” metrics won’t help it find footing because it is an expensive stock. It has a three-digit price-to-earnings ratio and its price-to-sales is almost 30. From that perspective, there could be some more downside in it.
In fact, on my charts, I expected it to target much lower values than this. But there are reasons to expect support at or below $450 per share. Unfortunately for the TTD stock bulls, this is a fast mover so it is tough to handle. On the way down, it always looks like it’s going into an abyss.
My solution for these monsters is to use options where I can build risk buffers. Instead of buying TTD shares, I sell the July $365 put, for example. I collect money to open the trade and I don’t need a rally to win. In fact, the stock can fall 35% and I can still break even. Compare that to buying the shares outright and risking $506 with no room for error.
TTD stock is expensive but it’s worth it so far. Growth companies like this need to spend money to deliver the results. So far, there is no reason to doubt this management team. They grew revenues three-fold since 2017 while also growing net income. Yes, they are spending a lot but not burning cash. In fact, their cash flow from operations is now seven times bigger than two years ago. They deserve the benefit of the doubt.

2021-05-12 00:00:00+00:00,First Week of June 18th Options Trading For Marvell Technology (MRVL),MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/first-week-of-june-18th-options-trading-for-marvell-technology-mrvl-2021-05-12,,,"Investors in Marvell Technology Inc (Symbol: MRVL) saw new options become available this week, for the June 18th expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the MRVL options chain for the new June 18th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $41.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.86. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $41.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $39.14 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of MRVL, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $42.48/share today.
Because the $41.00 strike represents an approximate 3% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 62%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 4.54% return on the cash commitment, or 44.75% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Marvell Technology Inc, and highlighting in green where the $41.00 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $43.00 strike price has a current bid of $2.33. If an investor was to purchase shares of MRVL stock at the current price level of $42.48/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $43.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 6.71% if the stock gets called away at the June 18th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if MRVL shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Marvell Technology Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing MRVL's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $43.00 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $43.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 51%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 5.48% boost of extra return to the investor, or 54.11% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.
The implied volatility in the put contract example, as well as the call contract example, are both approximately 48%.
Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $42.48) to be 45%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

Jason Moser: It's Wednesday, April 28th. I'm your host, Jason Moser, and on today's Wildcard Wednesday show, we're digging more to 5G and the digital economy with a special guest. Bruce Liu is the CEO of Esoterica Capital, an asset management firm based in New York, New York focused on investing in the digital economy. Bruce also manages Esoterica's active ETF which invests in the 5G enabled digital economy as well. Prior to Esoterica, he was a portfolio manager and partner of PhaseCapital, as well as an equity strategist at WisdomTree asset management, and a sell-side equity strategist at Sanford Bernstein. He received his PhD in business administration from the University of Connecticut, and holds the chartered financial analyst designation. Recently, I had the opportunity to chat with Bruce about 5G, digital economy, chip shortages, valuations, stocks he likes, and much, much more. We hope you enjoy our conversation. Bruce, thanks so much for joining us today. I wanted to start first and foremost just to give our members, our listeners a chance to understand better what you're doing there with Esoterica Capital. Tell us a little bit about your history, what you're doing with Esoterica Capital today, what you're working on.
Bruce Liu: Okay. Thank you for having me, Jason. It's nice meeting you today.
Moser: Absolutely.
Liu: Well, just a very brief introduction to Esoterica Capital. We started the firm almost -- time flies -- almost three years ago in New York City. We actually have offices in both New York City and actually Beijing, China. Five partners now and we got together three years ago, and thinking about what's the next thing to invest in, 5G cycle is the first one that comes into our mind. We wanted to do it a little bit differently than before. We used to be hedge fund portfolio managers and research analysts. This time around we saw the opportunity to launch an ETF, really serve the retail market. I always joke with the people, my mom missed the 4G cycle, I don't want her to miss the 5G cycle again. How about creating the investment vehicle, it's easier for her to put all her money in. Here we go.
That's really what was driving us to do this, and we launched the ETF WGI. Actually just at the end of March last year, it's been a year. We were very, very lucky. It's ironic, we got into the pandemic but our investment strategy actually benefited from that a lot. The whole digital transformation thing, people realized how valuable that is. The portfolio was benefiting. We had a fantastic run since the end of March last year. That's who we are.
Moser: Yeah. That's a great observation you made there. Just a year ago launching the fund. That was a really crazy time back in March and into April. We saw an unbelievable situation there on the market. I would imagine launching that fund you probably got in at a time where you were able to get some pretty good deals, along with really investing in a lot of the companies that since then have proven themselves to be really instrumental in this digital economy. There's a lot of crossover between your portfolio and the stocks that we recommended in our service, and I want to talk more about that. Real quickly, I did want to ask, the ticker WGI, what does that mean? There is a meaning there, I want to know what it is.
Liu: There is actually. That's how you pronounce 5G in Chinese. When you go to Asia, Hong Kong, Taiwan, China, when you say ""WG"" and people know you are referring to 5G.
Moser: See, I knew there was a meaning there, and I'm glad I asked. That was just something I saw and I thought, ""There's got to be something there."" That's perfect, great to know.
Liu: When we were thinking about the ticker back then and it happened that WGI was available, we thought, ""Why not?"" It's interesting.
Moser: That's perfect. I love it. That'll be very easy to remember. I guarantee you, I will never forget that personally.
Liu: Thank you.
Moser: Let's talk a little bit about 5G because that's really what our service is all about. It's Investing in 5G. Something I noticed with your fund that is very similar to the service that we run here, it's something that when we started our service here not all that long ago either, it will shortly after, it looks like you started your ETF. But we approached it with a very similar philosophy. It's not just about investing in the companies that are building out the infrastructure, the tower companies, the chip companies, the infrastructure companies, but it's also about all of these companies that are benefiting from the technology, right? These companies that are helping to build this digital economy that seems to be unfolding right before our very eyes. I wonder why in your mind, let's just imagine the pandemic never happened, 5G would still be happening, and it would still be important. Why do you feel the 5G economy is so important?
Liu: That's a very good question, Jason, and we got asked a lot about that. What do you see from 5G? Why not just invest in the carriers, guys like Nokia, Ericsson? Those infrastructure hardware makers. We see 5G a little bit different from probably some existing products out there. I always use the 4G cycle as a very perfect example to make my case. Think of all the 4G cycles in the U.S. We started the 4G cycle back in 2009, I believe. Also right after a recession, in the middle of the recession, very similar to how we started the 5G cycle. The significance of 4G is what? I keep asking people. It really created a mobile Internet, mobile Internet economy globally. The U.S. started first, then they exported that to the rest of the world. We saw how that has changed the world. 4G is more about connecting people. That changes the way we communicate, we consume information, we entertain ourselves. That's the significance of 4G. Not only with the 4G technology itself, not only with Nokia, Ericsson, Huawei, those guys who build the 4G infrastructure. Not only with AT&T, Verizon who provided 4G services. It's bigger than that. Transition from 3G to 4G, that was disrupting the technology ecosystem infrastructure.
From the very bottom to the very top, from the semiconductors, from the computing architecture to the software, how we deployed the software, and until the applications, that's where you've got the Uber, you got Netflix, and Facebook, Instagram, all those new things. I think that's the significance of 4G. Now 5G, looking back now, for 5G it's no longer a question, ""We're going to do it or not?"" It's just how long this 5G cycle is going to last, how much the value of creation is driven by 5G. Also, I want to make a case, we called this 5G cycle, now it's a 5G technology itself. There is a reason behind it because that's a combination of all kinds of technologies together, not only just 5G itself, you've got AI, you've got AT Computing, we can go on and on, and I'm going to talk about that later on, we can get to the details. Just looking back, 4G is just a special case of 5G in my opinion. 4G is connecting people. The significance of 5G is connecting everything together, that's what the purpose of 5G is. You connect more things together, you do it much faster, and there's low latency.
Moser: Yeah.
Liu: Meaning you really can do a lot of things in life. Just like you and me right now talking and once 5G is really here we have the AR/VR or VR capacity. We don't need to go to the meetings together anymore. I think that's where the promise of 5G and when everything connected together, what's the meaning of that? What's the true thing behind it? We generate tons of data.
Moser: You hit on something there with the data and it reminded me of a question that one of our members asked me recently in regard, one of our recommendations on the service is a company called DocuSign, I'm sure you're very familiar with it.
Liu: Of course.
Moser: The question was, how does a company like DocuSign benefit from something like 5G, 3G technology, 4G technology that's enough to send documents back and forth. They're right, I mean it's sending things back and forth, the technology needed for that is not really very complicated. But my point in the answer that I offered was, No. 1, it's not about what DocuSign is doing today, it's about what DocuSign is going to be doing tomorrow, in a year, in five years, and 10 years from now. It made me think of a traffic jam. I'm living here in Northern Virginia, and I'm sure you're up in New York.
Liu: Yeah.
Moser: You're very familiar with traffic jams. But really, 5G, it's about building more lanes, It's about accommodating more data. You just said it right there. It's really the amount of data that is being transferred today that is just monumental versus what we've been used to.
Liu: Because actually, Jason, we've gotten used to 4G mobile Internet. Our life, personal life is already digitized. You do everything online on your phone, it's all digitized. But the world is so much bigger than our own lives. A lot like business applications, manufacturing sites, there's just so many things that have now been digitized yet, that the promise of 5G is actually just to digitize every aspect of our life, our economy. That's why we called this a digital economy. We are really onto the path of digitizing everything in our life. That's the value creation for 5G, that's why in this cycle, in our mind, the 5G cycles just started. I don't know how long it's going to last, to maybe 10 years, even maybe 20 years. We are in the process of digitizing every aspect of our life, every corner of life is all going to become like online. It's all going to be stored, memorized, and somewhere in cloud, and analyzed. That's where we got tons of data. We get to know everything much better, which helps us to make better decisions. Not only on the personal level, also for business. I think that's one thing special about 5G.
A lot of people were asking, ""What's the big deal with 5G? I already able to do a lot of things with 4G, I don't need a 5G,"" which is true. 5G might be, on the personal level, offer you something better. You can play cloud gaming, you can do real-life engagement better and there's no latency while you are talking to your friends, your mum, maybe thousands of miles away like myself . But it's also about the business, I think the most significant part of 5G infrastructure is for business. On the manufacturing side, for example, all your machines are connecting together, and you can manage them better, making better decisions, maintain them better, and the smart cities got all connected. Now to mention the autonomous vehicle, there's a hype there, you need a 5G infrastructure to be there, to make this really practical.
Moser: I think a lot of people, when we had 3G, and we were talking about going to 4G, and they were, ""I don't need 4G. I can do everything just fine."" Because at that time, nobody was thinking that we would be watching videos on our phones, nobody was thinking we would be streaming music, everybody's still focused on owning their music. Then once the technology unfolds, and you witness all of the conveniences and the advancement it offers, then it becomes a little bit more clear in hindsight. I feel like with 5G that's going to happen as well. Five years from now, we're going to look back and say ""Wow, this was a big step forward."" I'm sure you and I will meet again, and we'll start talking about 6G.
Liu: Exactly. Also, something special about 5G, when the 3G PPP is designing the 5G protocol, they have this vertical application in mind. They actually have that in mind. They we're not just designing the standard for the 5G communication. When they design that, they are thinking about putting that into work, put into the different verticals, and for the industrials, for transportation, for warehousing, of course, for personal communication as well. That's why 5G is more significant in my opinion because that's really from the start. They have that in mind to drive the vertical adoption of 5G. Similar to the 4G cycle, if you look back to the history, every generational transition from 2G to 3G, 3G to 4G, now we get to the 4G to 5G, actually I'm just talking about the technology stack. It's a process of disrupting the legacy infrastructure, creating the new ones. I'll give you one example.
With the 5G, we spent so much money, energy on getting the 5G out there. What it really improves is the speed, capacity, latency from your home to the radio access network. That's what that 5G really improves. But that's not the whole thing. Think about that whenever you want to use your applications, you start on your phone, the data goes to the radio access network, but it has to go to the central Cloud, to go to its server. When you do the processing over there, the signal comes back to your phone. That's the loop. That's the ecosystem. Now, 5G's game is up so much. They have latency, they have speed. You have to improve the latency speed all over the place to realize the promise of 5G. It's purely from the technology perspective. That's what I think sometimes people are missing. 5G is not only that small part, 5G means that whole thing. Now, the legacy infrastructure may now be able to keep up with the requirement for the speed and the latency, so you have to change the way you do what we call computing architecture. I'll remind you that computing architecture is going to change. Right now, it is a part of the traditional datacenter. You put all the servers there, you stack all the servers there. Whenever you have new workloads, I need more servers, and everything goes to your CPU, you do it there and in there, that's in the central Cloud.
Then it goes back to, I don't know where your connected devices are, but that's the process. Well, in the 5G world, that's no longer working because it just takes so much time for the data to move from, for example, your phone to the central Cloud, and it comes back. Also, you imagine, and we've mentioned this earlier, going forward, we gather tons of that data from all over the place. Think about all the data that's going from your edge devices and to the central Cloud and come back. This is just now that you're facing the way to do things. That's why it's changing the computing architecture even from the semiconductor level. That's why the media and AMD, they're all coming out with these new solutions, and some of that you've heard about like DPU, data processing units, GPU is no longer new, and the smart NIC. What that really does, first, you do not put all the workload into the CPU anymore because you want to optimize that. You'll come up with a GPU, DPU to offload some workload from the CPU. You just allow the CPU to do what they are designed to do, the applications, revenue-generating applications. Well, let others like GPU, DPU do other data handling things like AI and machine learning, you let the DPU do that, or like the network accelerator, you let the DPU do that. That's where the world is going, and that's what I'm saying, disrupting the legacy technology stack and putting the new ones. This is very exciting, we are at the beginning of this whole thing.
Moser: Indeed, we're not fighting.
Liu: Also, to make 5G really work, to realize the true promise of 5G, the computing is not going to stay in the central Cloud anymore. AT computing is becoming a real thing. You have to put all of those computing capacities as close as possible to the edge devices to where the users are, and I think that's the new computing architecture we are talking about. We're at the very beginning of this. A lot of people are looking at, take a semiconductor, for example, as a very cyclical sector. It goes up, and it comes down, along with the GDP, PMI, that's no longer the case anymore. You got a structural change. You can really get a structural change of the whole industry. The need for semiconductors is growing exponentially from here just because of those, 5G, AI, this digital transformation we are talking about, we are going through. 5G is driving that. 5G is enabling technology. Sorry, I might throw too many concepts there, but this really, you want to connect everything together. You really want to connect the dots.
Moser: I think that's what you're doing, and that's what we try to do every day, every week with our services. It is a very big concept to grasp. We've talked about things like the Internet of Things, AI, and machine learning, AR, VR, Cloud, and Edge computing. That's one reason why I was so excited. One of our recommendations in the service is Cloudflare.
Liu: I love the company.
Moser: I do as well, and was very excited to see that crossover. Listen, you have a lot of great ideas in your fund and I've been through and looked through the holdings there. I'm excited to see the names that we own. I'm excited to see some of the names that we don't own because you're giving me some ideas to dig into. I wanted to ask you, maybe we could talk for a few minutes about a couple of the holdings in your fund that you really like, either a couple of stocks, a couple of holdings in that fund today that you're really optimistic about it, a couple of ideas that you feel really positive about. Obviously, you like them all, but are there any names in there, any companies in there that stand out to you?
Liu: Well, you've said the holdings and so the top positions are of high conviction, like Sea. That's Singapore-based e-commerce/gaming/payments. That's only the application of part, the way you imagine the company. Now because the 5G is not there yet but you can envision what kind of applications might have prosper and grow bigger, in the right regions to do that. Well, Sea stands out for us. They really serve the customers in South East Asia and sometimes even LatAm by giving this mobile gaming. So think about it when 5G comes. Can you imagine that part? It's just going to grow even more. Then they add e-commerce onto that. E-Commerce, no doubt, is going to benefit from 5G. You're going to switch from the traditional e-commerce to the new e-commerce. Actually, we write a lot above that, you people can go to our website and our Instagram and LinkedIn to take a look. We share that on a daily basis, digital payments.
When the whole world is going to go digital, there's no doubt that you have to make your payment in the digital way. So they really occupy three big long term things. That's why we like the firm. Of course, we did our research and we understand the management team. There's a high-quality management team. Just look at their execution in the past four or five years, fantastic. At the end of the day, this is people business, you have to have the right team there. Well, that's one. We go down the list and you can see a lot of high-quality Semi names, and we like them. We mentioned Semi is such an important component to really drive the digital transformation, to really build the new infrastructure. Starting from TSMC, AMD, and Marvell, Qualcomm, those are our core holdings. But today, I want to give you a new name. It's not in our portfolio yet, but we just love the company. We're actively doing research. Hopefully, Achronix, ACEV is the ticker, and is still in our spec. That's so far is a very small car. They are not the spec yet, but just take a look at a company, they are the only independent high-end FPGA semiconductor company out there. They really, really compete. The other two high-end FPGA companies, Xilinx and Altera, all acquired by the bigger boys, this is the only independent one. They're very much specialized.
I'll focus on this data accelerator, the stuff that we talked about earlier to offload some workloads from the CPUs. They focus on those workloads, computation of storage, artificial intelligence and machine learning, and also being very flexible and power-efficient, and high-performance. You can deploy all those semi solutions to the AT computings. They serve the end market from AI, machine learning, to 5G, to autonomous driving. That's the company we like, no matter who is going to build an awesome solution out there, you need their tips. That's the company that we're always looking for. We feel that's a very interesting idea. You still grow for [...]. You can see the huge potential once we can come to this path. But also that could very well become an M&A target. I'll throw something out there, Nvidia. I wouldn't be surprised if someday Nvidia takes a look at, ""Okay, you're my portfolio. I actually need something like an FPGA solution, this is just so perfect."" That's why we like the firm.
Moser: I love Nvidia too. It's one that I've recommended at another service. It's going to be very interesting to see what this antitrust process reveals in regard to the acquisition because I'm still not actually convinced that they're going to let that acquisition happen given Nvidia's status in the industry, it is such an important business, but not only a lot of important technology, but a lot of customers that really depend on them. It will be interesting to see how that antitrust process goes. You mentioned some other companies in there, Xilinx, which is a recommendation in our service, and so we're watching Xilinx go through that acquisition where AMD, Advanced Micro Devices bring it in Xilinx. Then the other one that I really liked and I was thrilled to be able to get it in early, was a company called INFY. INFY also recently acquired by Marvell Technology. Very excited to bring Marvell into our portfolio as well. When I saw all those in your fund, I thought, ""Hey, that's great. I love to see that kind of crossover."" But then it made me think this chip shortage has been pretty interesting to follow.
To your point, I think we're hitting a stage here where the cyclicality of the chip space, of the semi space is going to; maybe there will be some cyclical nature to it, but it's not going to be as pronounced I think, because to the point you just made, they are so crucial to everything that we do now. I have seen cars, for example, it's not uncommon for a car to have 50-75 chips in it. I wonder what your thoughts are on the recent chips shortage and how that's playing out in the market today.
Liu: You know our mind, there are both circular and cyclical factors contributing to this, also, geopolitical things. Well, we can think of three things. First, of course, you've got this beauty in inventory. While everybody is saying the pandemic it's going to be over, people are overbooking. That's the nature of that. That contributed to the shortage of the chips, that's for sure. Also, it's almost two years, and U.S., China, there's a semiconductor, we call it the semi war. We actually jolt a serious [...]. That's about it. Well, that actually is transforming the semi-supply chain. Back then, the global semi-supply chain was a very standard one. Now this new thinking into this, that does have some impact on the global semiconductor supply chain. We actually believe that contributes to the problem a little bit as well. The third one is really circular. Just because everybody saw this great digital transformation, the demand for those devices are just growing exponentially. We call that circular factor. Well, you have to look at this note by note for the leading-edge note, I mean, talking about TSMC's seven-nanometer note. There you need capacity. That's why if you look at the TSMC latest earning score, they've committed a legacy of 100 billion for the years for CAPEX. That CAPEX is really just going into the leading edge note.
Well, there is a shortage on the much shorter note like a ticker 28-nanometer note. Well, that's more cyclical. I think the tightening in that part is going to stay a little bit longer because you don't see the companies are willing to invest in new capacity into it. All of the capacity CAPEX is going into the leading edge at once. It's actually quite a complicated picture. You have to really look at end markets and different notes and say where this tightening is going to last. Well, also from TSMC, I'm just quoting them. They say, ""This general tightening is going to last into 2022, and even to 2023, don't be surprised if we get to that point."" But they do say there are auto customers and the next quarter we will be significantly improved. Let's see. But I don't think this is going to be resolved anytime soon and a lot of people are worried. The people are over-building. So far we haven't seen that yet, where people spend the money on are actually the leading edge, ones which have the circular tailwind.
Moser: Yeah, it feels at least even though there are headwinds in the space today, it's nice to be invested in companies where the demand for their products are so high, the demand is so high for what they do. That's why we have continued to build out so many of those recommendations in the service based on that chip space because to me, that's a crucial part to this entire thing working. We talked a lot about all of these different technologies that are being enabled by this. Again, we mentioned AI and VR, AR and LT, and all the stuff. Is there a particular capability or a particular technology that's being born from this 5G rollout, from this 5G stretch here? Is there a particular technology or capability that you're more excited about than others are? Is it Edge computing? Is it AI? Is it VR? What really gets you excited?
Liu: Well, my thought process really centers on data. Generating data, moving data, processing data, analyzing data, and storing data. That's where my thought process is really focusing on. Like [...] here, driven by 5G and you need to generate the data from the 5G devices. That's where Qualcomm's new RF, Front-End, and also Baseband Technologies are promising. They're interesting as very high-end and the technology leadership from Qualcomm offering this specific 5G application is actually widening, now, likely closing. That's where 5G is specific. But thinking out of 5G, thinking about digital economy, once you get tons of data, processing those data, that's where we actually mentioned earlier, this DPU really separate the CPU, DPU, GPU, have the different, they're like chips, focusing on what they are good at, then deploy in that way. That's also something we're very excited about. That's changing how the computing architecture is built.
Of course, you mentioned AT computings, we'll wait to see. Cloudflare is a very promising one. They do all kinds of the right work at this early stage. I don't know, one day when the big boys come into the picture, try to compete with them. See Amazon, AWS has been working with Verizon providing the AT computing, I forgot the name of the services, in 10 cities in the U.S. already. I think that's a very interesting part of the whole thing. Well, moving it up a little bit on the software lane. Once you'll get all the data, how do you just make the best out of that? Store it, analyzing and processing in the most efficient way, and really allow people to do, allow AI, ML work on it. That's why we like Snowflake. We really do. They're the frontrunner in that space. They make it this whole a lot easier for businesses to do the data work. Loosely speaking, all data breaks and also [...] private companies. Although it's just a private, we already started doing work on them. Just try to understand that once they go public when the time is right, that we want to put it in. That's where the most exciting part is. Well, it's a little bit too early to talk about the application of 5G. Autonomous driving, that's exciting, but it comes back to semiconductor work, a lot like algorithm work Google [Alphabet] has been doing. We want to wait and see. It's like what you said earlier, five years later. People are smart, developers are so smart. Once we build the infrastructure, we give them the capacity. They're going to build something really, really awesome. I have no doubt about that. Hopefully, as investors, we fund them earlier and better.
Moser: That you say the keyword there, you said earlier, and I love how you're digging in the companies even before they go public. That's terrific. In regard to something we talked about a lot is the state of the market today valuations, you got a lot of companies like SPACs that are going public, and they're often pre-revenue, or they are just starting revenue. You have a lot of other companies like Cloudflare, for example, companies that are growing very quickly, but clearly, the financials aren't reflecting the true potential economics of the business yet.
Liu: No.
Moser: How do you approach that valuation coming on from there? Looking at a lot of these companies that seemingly the businesses look very important, and we know they're going to be crucial, but the valuations, they scare a lot of people off. What do you tell those people who get scared of those types of valuations?
Liu: Well, Jason, that's a very good question. I get that a lot, especially the investment we do. That's always challenging. Well, first of all, I think your valuation is a relative concept. A lot of people are making cases so expensive right now. Look at the S&P, look at Nasdaq. The valuation is higher than back to the tech bubble. But think about this, put it into the context. Back then, the U.S. 10-year real yield was 400 bps. Right now what is? Today I just look at it like negative 70 bps.
Moser: Wow.
Liu: That's what's supporting the valuation they say, it's all relative. If you look at the equity risk premium, really taking into account this free rate, it's not that crazy. I'm not saying it's cheap, but it's not as crazy as it sounds, so that's the first thing. The second thing is a lot of companies that's where that research makes a huge difference. That's purely the nature of our business. We try to find those companies, they are in the growth mode. They have awesome ideas, awesome products, and it's really the time for them to invest back. R&D, sales and marketing, expanding market share. What really matters is really expanding their TAM. They're in the invest mode. Of course, their bottom line looks horrible, that's where you need to understand the business. A lot of people are just saying things and they make a beautiful presentation, and they're telling good stories, but actually, the potential for them to deliver may be very low. But for some other companies, their execution is great, fantastic in managing the team, fantastic theme, and great products. You see the potential for them to grow, become the next Amazon. Think about this, debate for Amazon has been around for how long? People keep missing it because of this, ""This is so expensive.""
Even today, you heard about people arguing about that, same thing for Netflix. Now everybody realizes Netflix is going to become like a cash call very soon. This is more art than science. That's where you really need to do your homework rather than just blindly looking at the valuation match rates like, ""This is so expensive, this is cheap."" No, focus on the fundamental, focus on the company, and being able to tell, are they able to deliver? That's the thing. But in general, I agree with you. Just think about what's going to happen in February. Stop talking about this year, I'm not even talking about this year. From the beginning of the year to the mid of February, the market had a nice run, why? It's very easy if you put a real yield on there. Real yield dropped to almost -100 bps. That's really supporting the equity evaluation. Although the interest 10-year is rising, but real yield is staying low, inflation expectation is rising high. This is a perfect setup for the risky assets. That's why we had a nice run. But since the middle of February, the dynamic has changed, and now everybody knows that.
But if you focus on our charts -- sorry, I should insert a chart here, as we have very telling charts, we even wrote about that. Since the middle of February, 10-year treasury yields keep capital rising up, but the dynamic has changed. That was more driven by the rising up of real yields, which might be a proxy for financial condition. Financial condition was tightening for many reasons. Japanese buyers didn't want to come to the market. We had a horrible seven year, like an auction. You got tons of narratives out there, but that's what's driving that. When that happens, when real yield was rising up fast, within almost just two weeks or even just one week, it rose up from -100 bps to almost -50 bps. That's a huge change.
When you have the real yield while it's rising up, who is more vulnerable? The long-duration assets allow a growth in stocks, because your term value decides your valuation, so that's why we call them long-duration assets. Also, the expensive ones, because this real yield was supporting your valuation now, and it's less supportive. The market was in the mood of, ""Shoot first, then ask the question later,"" so that's why we went through this. People call it the huge rotation, it's really just killing high-growth, expensive stocks. It happens to all those thematic portfolios. That's what was happening. Going forward, I still believe, if you have a long-term view, stay in the lane, stay investing in hyper-growth companies. This is where the future is. Well, you have to be very mindful of the valuation now. Well, if you don't think real yield is going to go back to the next few 100 bps which we don't think that's the case. If you don't have that, but real yield hopefully is going to stay tight range, stable, but still low.
My assumption is in the near term or midterm, 10-year treasury's real yield might stay in the range around negative 50 bps, which historically is still very good. It still supports the risky assets, but not good enough to support the high fliers. I feel that the high fliers, the companies, I call them dream stocks. You have to be able to tell who is the real deal, who are the dreaming stocks. I don't think they are going to go back to where they were back in January and February, they're under a lot of pressure. But the high quality ones who can deliver the growth, you can see gradually, they're going to come back. That's my phase, so that's how I look at the markets and how I pick my stocks.
Moser: I love that. It's very much in line with the way we think here. Not only in next gen, super-cycle, or service. But really, The Motley Fool, generally speaking, believes that time is the individual investor's greatest advantage or at least one of them. Being able to be patient, finding good businesses, and then taking that five to 10 year time, that view, that gives you the freedom to weather those ups and downs, because we know those ups and downs, they're going to happen regardless. But it certainly sounds like you think about investing the way we think about it too, and that's why this conversation has been so fun.
Liu: We're at the beginning of the whole thing. I keep telling my friends, don't be afraid of the volatilities. Don't gamble, don't take unnecessary leverage. Don't even take leverage. Let the company's leverage work for you. I always keep telling my friends, finding those companies, let them work for you.
Moser: I think that's absolutely the right way to look at it. Like we told so many folks, if you want to invest in 5G, if you wait until 2023 or 2024, you're going to be too late. You have to start now because it's starting now, it's going to take a little while. I think a lot of folks think 5G is just like hitting a switch. It's really not that way at all, it's going to be something that is going to be a slow process, an evolution, so to speak, here I think over the next decade, certainly, in the next five years ought to be great.
Liu: Also finding the right exposure. 5G hardware makers like Ericsson, Nokia, we don't like them. We do not like carriers and we can go on and on, but we don't even like the smartphone makers this time around. Think about 4G, smartphones are from 0-1, that change is significant. But from 4G to 5G, it's no longer from 0-1, it's just a replacement cycle. Instead of betting on the smartphone, betting on the semiconductors in the phone.
Moser: The companies licensing that technology companies like Qualcomm.
Liu: Exactly.
Moser: [...] followed a company called CBA, but a very similar business, one that is a very small company, but they license a lot of that technology and --
Liu: Exactly.
Moser: [...] want to follow.
Liu: Yeah, exactly.
Moser: Bruce, this has been so much fun and I know we're pressed for time, so I'm going to go ahead and cut it off here and let you go because I want to save some time for our next conversation because you can rest assured, I'm going to reach back out to you. I want to talk to you again.
Liu: Thank you very much. This is so fun.
Moser: Well, for folks who want to learn more about Esoterica Capital, and what you all are doing there, really quickly just tell folks how they can find you.
Liu: Well, it's easy. We actually, actively reach out to our audience. We want to serve retail investors, we walk the talk, we meet. Come to our website, come to our LinkedIn, come to our Instagram page. We do share everything on a daily basis, what we observe and what our latest thoughts are. We share a lot of stuff out there, and just come to find us. Well, also you can email me, and I'm always open to a conversation.
Moser: Absolutely. Hopefully, we'll be able to meet actually in person someday sooner rather than later.
Liu: Looking forward to it, Jason.

2021-05-06 00:00:00+00:00,MRVL June 25th Options Begin Trading,MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/mrvl-june-25th-options-begin-trading-2021-05-06,,,"Investors in Marvell Technology Inc (Symbol: MRVL) saw new options begin trading today, for the June 25th expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the MRVL options chain for the new June 25th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $40.00 strike price has a current bid of 65 cents. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $40.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $39.35 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of MRVL, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $45.28/share today.
Because the $40.00 strike represents an approximate 12% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 79%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 1.62% return on the cash commitment, or 11.86% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Marvell Technology Inc, and highlighting in green where the $40.00 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $47.00 strike price has a current bid of 16 cents. If an investor was to purchase shares of MRVL stock at the current price level of $45.28/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $47.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 4.15% if the stock gets called away at the June 25th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if MRVL shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Marvell Technology Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing MRVL's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $47.00 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $47.00 strike represents an approximate 4% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 56%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 0.35% boost of extra return to the investor, or 2.58% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.
The implied volatility in the put contract example is 52%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 73%.
Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $45.28) to be 45%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

2021-04-29 00:00:00+00:00,News Flash: Analysts Just Made A Captivating Upgrade To Their Marvell Technology Group Ltd. (NASDAQ:MRVL) Forecasts,MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/news-flash%3A-analysts-just-made-a-captivating-upgrade-to-their-marvell-technology-group-ltd,,,"Marvell Technology Group Ltd. (NASDAQ:MRVL) shareholders will have a reason to smile today, with the analysts making substantial upgrades to this year's forecasts. The analysts have sharply increased their revenue numbers, with a view that Marvell Technology Group will make substantially more sales than they'd previously expected.
After this upgrade, Marvell Technology Group's six analysts are now forecasting revenues of US$4.1b in 2022. This would be a huge 39% improvement in sales compared to the last 12 months. Prior to the latest estimates, the analysts were forecasting revenues of US$3.5b in 2022. It looks like there's been a clear increase in optimism around Marvell Technology Group, given the nice gain to revenue forecasts.
NasdaqGS:MRVL Earnings and Revenue Growth April 29th 2021
There was no particular change to the consensus price target of US$54.67, with Marvell Technology Group's latest outlook seemingly not enough to result in a change of valuation. The consensus price target is just an average of individual analyst targets, so - it could be handy to see how wide the range of underlying estimates is. Currently, the most bullish analyst values Marvell Technology Group at US$64.00 per share, while the most bearish prices it at US$45.00. These price targets show that analysts do have some differing views on the business, but the estimates do not vary enough to suggest to us that some are betting on wild success or utter failure.
Taking a look at the bigger picture now, one of the ways we can understand these forecasts is to see how they compare to both past performance and industry growth estimates. The analysts are definitely expecting Marvell Technology Group's growth to accelerate, with the forecast 39% annualised growth to the end of 2022 ranking favourably alongside historical growth of 4.8% per annum over the past five years. Compare this with other companies in the same industry, which are forecast to grow their revenue 8.7% annually. It seems obvious that, while the growth outlook is brighter than the recent past, the analysts also expect Marvell Technology Group to grow faster than the wider industry.
The Bottom Line
The most important thing to take away from this upgrade is that analysts lifted their revenue estimates for this year. They're also forecasting more rapid revenue growth than the wider market. Given that analysts appear to be expecting substantial improvement in the sales pipeline, now could be the right time to take another look at Marvell Technology Group.
Unsatisfied? At least one of Marvell Technology Group's six analysts has provided estimates out to 2024, which can be seen for free on our platform here.
Of course, seeing company management invest large sums of money in a stock can be just as useful as knowing whether analysts are upgrading their estimates. So you may also wish to search this free list of stocks that insiders are buying.

April 27 (Reuters) - Arm Ltd, the British chip technology firm being acquired by Nvidia Corp NVDA.O in a $40 billion deal, on Tuesday gave new details about its next generation of data center technology and said Oracle Corp ORCL.N and Alibaba Group Holding 9988.HK will use the chips.
Arm creates underlying intellectual property that other firms such as Qualcomm Inc QCOM.O or Apple Inc AAPL.O then license to create their own processor chips. Arm's technology powers most mobile phones, but it is making a push into data center processors, where Intel Corp INTC.O and Advanced Micro Devices AMD.O have long dominated.
Analysts view Arm's data center efforts as the key reason that Nvidia, which also competes against Intel, sought to buy the firm. British officials have invoked a national security law to review the deal. NL8N2MC3LU
Arm said on Tuesday that its ""N2"" Neoverse computing cores are expected to be about 40% faster than the previous generation. The company also said that its ""V1"" cores - which are designed to handle a different type of math commonly used for artificial intelligence - are expected to be 50% faster than traditional methods of doing the same tasks.
Arm said that Marvell Technology Inc MRVL.O is making a chip using its new technology. It also said that Oracle will use Arm-based chips made by Ampere Computing in its growing cloud computing business, and that Chinese technology giant Alibaba is preparing to offer Arm-based cloud computing services, though the chip vendor was not disclosed.
The new cloud customers come after Intel for years controlled more than 90% of the market for data center chips. Chris Bergey, Arm's senior vice president and general manager for its infrastructure line of business, said that Arm's approach has been to license its technology to many different chip companies who are taking different approaches to winning business from cloud customers.
""We're all engineers here - there's different optimization points, there's different views"" Bergey told Reuters in an interview. ""I don't think anyone is saying Arm is not a viable alternative.""

2021-04-27 00:00:00+00:00,Here's What Marvell Technology Group Ltd.'s (NASDAQ:MRVL) Shareholder Ownership Structure Looks Like,MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/heres-what-marvell-technology-group-ltd.s-nasdaq%3Amrvl-shareholder-ownership-structure,,,"The big shareholder groups in Marvell Technology Group Ltd. (NASDAQ:MRVL) have power over the company. Generally speaking, as a company grows, institutions will increase their ownership. Conversely, insiders often decrease their ownership over time. Companies that used to be publicly owned tend to have lower insider ownership.
With a market capitalization of US$38b, Marvell Technology Group is rather large. We'd expect to see institutional investors on the register. Companies of this size are usually well known to retail investors, too. Our analysis of the ownership of the company, below, shows that institutional investors have bought into the company. Let's delve deeper into each type of owner, to discover more about Marvell Technology Group.
NasdaqGS:MRVL Ownership Breakdown April 27th 2021
What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Marvell Technology Group?
Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.
As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Marvell Technology Group. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Marvell Technology Group's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.
NasdaqGS:MRVL Earnings and Revenue Growth April 27th 2021
Investors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Marvell Technology Group. Our data shows that FMR LLC is the largest shareholder with 15% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 9.0% and 8.7%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.
We also observed that the top 9 shareholders account for more than half of the share register, with a few smaller shareholders to balance the interests of the larger ones to a certain extent.
While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.
Insider Ownership Of Marvell Technology Group
The definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.
Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.
Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Marvell Technology Group Ltd.. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$201m worth of shares. Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling.
General Public Ownership
The general public holds a 10% stake in Marvell Technology Group. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.
Next Steps:
I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted 1 warning sign for Marvell Technology Group you should know about.

2021-04-20 00:00:00+00:00,How The Pieces Add Up: QTEC Targets $165,MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/how-the-pieces-add-up%3A-qtec-targets-%24165-2021-04-20,,,"Looking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at ETF Channel, we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. For the First Trust NASDAQ-100-Technology Sector Index Fund ETF (Symbol: QTEC), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $165.06 per unit.
With QTEC trading at a recent price near $149.52 per unit, that means that analysts see 10.39% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of QTEC's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are Marvell Technology Group Ltd (Symbol: MRVL), Analog Devices Inc (Symbol: ADI), and Applied Materials, Inc. (Symbol: AMAT). Although MRVL has traded at a recent price of $46.65/share, the average analyst target is 12.35% higher at $52.41/share. Similarly, ADI has 11.23% upside from the recent share price of $156.91 if the average analyst target price of $174.53/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting AMAT to reach a target price of $145.53/share, which is 11.18% above the recent price of $130.89. Below is a twelve month price history chart comparing the stock performance of MRVL, ADI, and AMAT:
Combined, MRVL, ADI, and AMAT represent 7.40% of the First Trust NASDAQ-100-Technology Sector Index Fund ETF. Below is a summary table of the current analyst target prices discussed above:
NAME SYMBOL RECENT PRICE AVG. ANALYST 12-MO. TARGET % UPSIDE TO TARGET
First Trust NASDAQ-100-Technology Sector Index Fund ETF QTEC $149.52 $165.06 10.39%
Marvell Technology Group Ltd MRVL $46.65 $52.41 12.35%
Analog Devices Inc ADI $156.91 $174.53 11.23%
Applied Materials, Inc. AMAT $130.89 $145.53 11.18%
Are analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past. These are questions that require further investor research.

The vote also approves the reorganization of the combined company to be domiciled in Delaware, US. In a separate meeting held before the vote, Inphi’s shareholders also voted in agreement to merge with Marvell. Marvell (MRVL) expects the transaction to be sealed by April 20, 2021, after all the customary closing conditions are met. “The final voting results on all agenda items for each company's special meeting will be disclosed in separate Current Reports on Form 8-K to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission”, read the company’s statement. (See Marvell stock analysis on TipRanks) Susquehanna’s Analyst Christopher Rolland stated that the crux of his last call with Marvell’s CEO Matt Murphy boiled down to “optimism around the growing ASIC opportunity”. The semiconductor producer expects the acquisition of Inphi to be a welcome boost due to its strong optics position. The analyst reported, “Overall, management believes custom ASICs (5G, Cloud, Auto) could be billions of dollars of opportunities five years from now. The Inphi addition and its strong optics position should be an accelerator and attractant for new ASIC businesses more broadly.” However, Rolland sums it up as “Pipeline of hyperscale interest into Marvell’s ASIC portfolio is accelerating. Supply still an intermediate term issue, but the long-term growth story is strengthening.” The analyst has since reiterated a Buy rating on the stock. He has increased the price target of the stock to $62 from $60, implying 21.9% upside potential to current levels. Consensus on Wall Street is a Strong Buy based on 14 Buy and 4 Hold ratings. An average analyst price target of $54.94 implies 13.30% upside potential to current levels. Marvell scores a “Perfect 10” on TipRanks’ Smart Score rating system. This implies that the stock is likely to outperform market expectations.

2021-04-09 00:00:00+00:00,2 Top 5G Stocks I'd Buy Right Now,MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/2-top-5g-stocks-id-buy-right-now-2021-04-09,,,"The demand for 5G (fifth-generation) smartphones is set to explode in 2021. Market research firm IDC says that 5G smartphones could account for 40% of global smartphone volumes of 1.35 billion units this year, indicating that shipments could hit 540 million units in 2021.
That would be a huge jump over last year's 5G smartphone shipments of 213 million units. IDC also estimates that 5G smartphone shipments could exceed 1 billion units by 2025. All of this means that savvy investors can set themselves up for long-term upside by buying the right 5G stocks.
Qorvo (NASDAQ: QRVO) and Marvell Technology Group (NASDAQ: MRVL) are two 5G stocks that I'd consider buying right away, as they are benefiting big-time from the transition to the next-generation wireless technology. Both stocks have rallied impressively over the past month, and investors shouldn't delay further as they can soar higher as the 5G catalyst gets stronger.
QRVO data by YCharts
Let's take a look at the reasons why now would be a good time to buy these stocks.
Image source: Getty Images.
1. Qorvo
Qorvo makes radio frequency (RF) chips that allow smartphones to connect to wireless networks and the internet. It gets most of its revenue by supplying these chips to OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) such as Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Samsung, Vivo, Oppo, and Xiaomi, among others. The mobile business produced 75% of the chipmaker's total revenue in the fiscal third quarter that ended on Jan. 2, 2021.
So, Qorvo is your ideal bet to take advantage of the rapid growth of 5G smartphones thanks to its relationship with the top OEMs that are dominating this space. The good news is that those relationships are translating into terrific financial growth. Qorvo is looking at $1.04 billion in revenue for the recently concluded fiscal fourth quarter of 2021, which would be a 32% jump over the prior-year period's top line.
This indicates that Qorvo is stepping on the gas as its Q3 revenue had increased 26% year over year. Also, don't be surprised to see Qorvo sustain this impressive top-line momentum in the new fiscal year as smartphone build activity at its key customers indicates. Apple, for instance, is going to play a crucial role in Qorvo's growth as it accounts for 33% of its total revenue, and the smartphone giant is reportedly on the way to break sales records in 2021.
Daniel Ives of Wedbush says that Apple's iPhone shipments could hit 250 million units in 2021, eclipsing 2015's shipments of 231 million units. More importantly, supply chain rumors suggest that Apple could bump its initial build orders for the 2021 iPhone lineup by 25% to 100 million units over last year. Given that Apple is expected to remain a dominant player in the 5G smartphone market, it can act as a multiyear catalyst for Qorvo.
And finally, 5G smartphones are going to give Qorvo's margin profile a big boost. That's because the company is witnessing a $5 to $7 increase in chip content in 5G smartphones over 4G. Qorvo also says that 5G RF content in midrange smartphones is reportedly doubling over 4G devices. The additional content is already driving the company's margins higher.
QRVO EPS Estimates for Current Fiscal Year data by YCharts
Not surprisingly, Qorvo's earnings growth is expected to pick up the pace thanks to a mix of higher volumes and stronger content in 5G smartphones. All of this makes Qorvo an ideal growth stock for investors to buy right now as it is trading at less than 20 times forward earnings.
2. Marvell Technology Group
Shares of Marvell Technology Group have taken off in the past month after a weak start to the year, thanks to the company's terrific Q4 results that were driven by a big surge in the networking business.
Marvell delivered $798 million in revenue last quarter, a jump of 11% over the prior-year period. It expects $800 million in revenue in the current quarter, which would translate into a 15% year-over-year increase. This acceleration in Marvell's top-line growth isn't surprising as the company is witnessing a sharp increase in demand for its networking products that go into setting up 5G infrastructure, which is essential for the functioning of 5G smartphones.
Marvell says that the demand for 5G infrastructure will get stronger across the world as spectrum auctions take place in more regions. The company is well placed to take advantage of this secular growth as it is supplying its 5G solutions to the likes of Samsung and Nokia, two companies that are playing a major role in 5G deployments around the globe.
Samsung recently announced that it has jointly developed a new chip platform with Marvell that can enhance the performance of 5G networks. The South Korean company plans to introduce this new chip platform to Tier 1 telecom customers in the ongoing quarter. This bodes well for Marvell as Samsung has quickly scaled up its presence in the 5G infrastructure market.
The company reportedly held 10% to 15% of the 5G infrastructure market in the middle of 2020 by closing deals with the likes of Verizon in the U.S. and NTT DoCoMo in Japan just last month. Additionally, the demand for Marvell's baseband processors that will be deployed in 5G base stations is also picking up.
Marvell estimates that its networking revenue is on track to increase 20% year over year in the current quarter thanks to these tailwinds. But more importantly, the networking business's impressive run could last for a long time to come as the 5G infrastructure market is expected to clock a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of nearly 60% through 2027, according to third-party research. Similarly, the 5G base station market is also expected to clock a 33.7% CAGR through 2028 as deployments gather pace across the globe.
The networking business produced 55% of Marvell's total revenue last quarter and recorded 16% year-over-year growth. Marvell expects faster growth from this segment in the current quarter, and that's a trend that it could sustain for a long time because of the catalysts discussed above. And, given that Marvell is trading at just 21 times trailing earnings, investors have an opportunity to buy this 5G stock at an inexpensive valuation right now before it takes off in the future.

This video was recorded on April 2, 2021.
Chris Hill: It's spring break and we are coming to you from South Beach.
Ron Gross: There you go.
Hill: Not really, but we are taking advantage of spring break.
Jason Moser: I'm too old for South Beach. [laughs]
Hill: To bring you our springtime special. If you're new to the show, that means we're going to be leaning heavily into the theme of spring cleaning. Ron Gross, let me start with you. When you think about all the things you do around the yard, trimming those hedges. We've had a bunch of stocks that have really done well over the past 12 months in particular, what does the high flier that you think investors should consider may be trimming?
Gross: Have we not met? Do you think I'm trimming hedges? [laughs] If you had asked me a month ago the same question, I would've had an embarrassment of riches to choose from. But many of those high fliers have already pulled back 15%-20%. That Nasdaq, which is home to many of these companies, is off about 8% from its recent highs. What I did is I went old school, I went to the retail industry to a company we talked about just last week, Five Below. Shares are up 180% over the last year and up 240% from the March 2019 lows. It's now an $11 billion company. Recent quarterly year results were good. You got to give them credit for putting up strong numbers, but this is a discount retailer. This is not a tech company, so we've got growth of 10%, 12%, not 50%. They're launching a new growth engine, a new store prototype called Five Beyond, which will sell somewhat more expensive merchandise. That's a pretty crowded field already, it doesn't excite me. I think the reason you got to trim this one, is because the valuation has just gotten away from reality. 48 times forward earnings, 27 times EBITDA. The Dollar Stores, they only sell around 20 times. Costco, perhaps one of the finest businesses in this general space, only gets a 34 multiple at 48 times forward earnings. I think you've got to trim Five Below.
Hill: Makes sense to me. Jason Moser, what about you?
Moser: A Five Beyond, wow, I wouldn't even. I knew they were digging into that space, but that's fascinating. Yeah. I am going to go with TripAdvisor here. I don't own TripAdvisor anymore, I sold those shares a while back. That was just one of those weeds that I pulled from my portfolio. I think it could be argued that TripAdvisor was a bad business before all of this pandemic stuff hit. I don't think it really is any better of a business now than it was then. It's still very much a company playing defense right now. The market today though, it's giving it a valuation. Ron, they just signed Tom Brady, [laughs] but I don't quite understand it. It's up better than 200% over the last year, 37% over the last three years, but it's actually down 10% over the last five. It seems like the longer you go, the worse that gets. Nothing really fundamentally has changed with the business. Travel obviously is massive. We love it. It's a market you want exposure to.
As a consumer, I find TripAdvisor to be a very valuable and helpful tool, that when we travel, I use it often. They've just not really been able to make that translate into a great business. The most recent quarterly results included guidance and they are ultimately calling for quarter one revenue and adjusted EBITDA to be roughly in line with this past fourth quarter or so. It doesn't look like things are getting any better anytime soon. They've introduced this TripAdvisor Plus subscription service. I like where that's coming from. To me though, it really feels late to the game. I have a hard time seeing it having a tremendous impact because so many users of TripAdvisor services have been trained to get it for free, and if you can't get it from TripAdvisor for free, there are a lot of other places you can. To me, it's been a great run-up. If you own this name, you want to at least take some off the table because I don't know that anything really has fundamentally changed with the business.
Hill: Spring cleaning isn't spring cleaning unless you're actually throwing things away. Ron, what does a stock investor should consider just throwing out altogether?
Gross: I've got to do it, Chris, and tell you that at $13 billion market cap, you got to throw out GameStop. You just have to. It's probably the most famous of the meme stocks, share price is artificially high, largely thanks to the online Reddit community. At the height of this folly, the stock traded at $483 per share, it now sits at about $185. I'll remind listeners that pre-COVID the shares traded for $5 or maybe $6 on a good day. The company has had 12 straight quarters of declining sales. Now, there's a possibility that this company survives. The chewy founder and some other folks have taken control of this company, joined the board trying to recreate it, transform it into the Amazon of gaming. There is a chance that they remain a viable company but you can't pay $13 billion for this company. That absolutely makes no sense. Would you acquire this company for $13 billion? I certainly hope you wouldn't. Therefore, you shouldn't be buying the stock at that price either. I think you've got to throw this one out.
Hill: Jason, what are you throwing out?
Moser: I was back and forth on which one I would trim and which one I would sell. Maybe I got this wrong, but I think I got them right. This is probably going to rub a few people the wrong way, but I'd sell Stitch Fix. It's not a company that I own, but it's a business that as time goes on, it becomes apparent to me that it's not one that I want to own. You remember, just a couple of quarters ago, they had the massive short squeeze after that earnings release that really popped shares. You could just do a little digging into the release and see that the results weren't as good as the credit the market was giving it. But due to that high short interest, the numbers just were the numbers. I will just say, I was a little bit disappointed in management so quickly revising those growth estimates. That's short squeeze was due to those growth estimates of around 20%-25%. The very next quarter, they throttled back those estimates. Right now they're calling for maybe 18%-20% growth on the top-line there. It doesn't look like client count is growing as quickly as it really should be for a business like this. In the most recent quarter, they grew client count 12%. A year ago in the same quarter, that was 17%, so growth is slowing down.
I don't know that they're able to keep those clients on for the long-haul. They talked about the challenges that they're facing in the business. Part of it is longer cycle times and that's not all their fault. This is carrier and client delays, a lot of it has been COVID related no doubt. But then also secondly, and this is similar to what TripAdvisor is doing here, Stitch Fix has this direct buy feature and it's not new. It's been out for a couple of years now in some form, in just a perpetual beta status. It's something that allows existing clients to purchase items directly from Stitch Fix. It doesn't seem like it's that difficult to figure out, but they still haven't really nailed it. It's still basically in beta, and it's still there dragging it out. It leads me to believe that maybe this is a company that's limited in its optionality. You pay a lot to acquire these customers, you really need to keep them, it doesn't really seem like they're doing that good of a job of keeping them. The bottom line for me is just fashion is really hard. It's just really, really difficult. I have a hard time figuring out what to put on in the morning, Chris. I know that Stitch Fix is geared toward helping us fix that, it just doesn't really seem like it's one where I'd feel good about owning shares for long periods of time. I think they're just better ideas out there.
Hill: Let's go to the other end of the spectrum, Ron. In the spirit of Marie Kondo, what is the stock that sparks joy in you?
Gross: For me, it's got to be Disney. First, come on, it's a house of mouse. You've got some of the best, most fun entertainment properties in the world. You got Mickey, sure, but you've got Iron Man and Star Wars and Toy Story, ESPN and ABC, and of course, the amusement parks and the hotels. Two, it's a sentimental favorite for me. It's the first stock I bought for both of my kids almost 20 years ago, and we still own it to this day. Three, the company is transforming itself with Disney+ streaming. The growth has been phenomenal, really impressive there. Finally, COVID took a big whack out of Disney when the parks closed, but the stock has recovered, I think it now represents a wonderful reopened play as the parks come online and people get back out into the world. I like me some Disney.
Hill: Can't argue with that. What about you, Jason?
Moser: Yes sir. This one was easy. First name that came to mind, Wayfair. This is a company that has just done tremendously over the last several years. Year-to-date, the stock is up around 50%. Over the past year that's only up 640%, just middle of the road. The last five years, up 740%. It's been a nice stretch for Wayfair. I understand when the company was just getting its feet on the ground, the skepticism in moving furniture from point A to point B being a very expensive proposition, but these guys have really proven themselves to have figured something out. I think the beauty of it really is in the business model. Being a network as opposed to just an online furniture store, I think that's the key there. I enjoy it as a customer. I enjoy it as a shareholder. I think one of the main reasons I enjoy this as a shareholder is, well, it's really two. When you look at the results over the most recent quarter, total net revenue grew 45% year over year. Gross margin of 29% was up from 22.9% a year ago. The number of active customers reached 31.2 million. At the end of December 2020, that was up 53.7%. Then back to that Stitch Fix challenge, Wayfair is really good at keeping those customers. We use this metric, repeat customers placed 72.5% of total orders delivered in the quarter compared to 68.6% the previous year.
Wayfair does a really good of acquiring the customers and then keeping them and bringing us back to buy more stuff. I can tell you that in our house there's a lot of repeat Wayfair purchases from our house. But perhaps the most joyous of all here is that my share ownership of Wayfair is going to help me finance this massive deck renovation [laughs] at my house here, Chris. This is not going to be a small project and the gains that I have witnessed in my share ownership of Wayfair will help finance those. Knowing that I'm going to look out at this deck for years to come and it will be a Trex deck, by the way, folks, don't make any mistake there, that will spark joy on a daily basis, particularly hey, listen, this summer it sounds like maybe I'm going to be doing a little work on that deck, working from home on that deck and that'll be nice to enjoy the sunny weather.
Hill: It's our springtime special. Of course, Ron, springtime is all about rebirth and renewal. What is a stock or industry that you believe is poised for a comeback?
Gross: I like industrials right here. We've already seen a rotation out of some of the high-flying tech stocks into industrials. But I think this trend still has legs especially if Biden and Congress can pass a meaningful infrastructure plan. It won't be the $3 trillion plan Biden is talking about, but it still could be significant. Industrial companies like Caterpillar, and Newcore, United Rentals, Vulcan Materials, I think should continue to do well as we hopefully begin to rebuild our roads and bridges. Renewable energy companies in the space like NextEra Energy should also do well. Keep an eye on industrials for at least the next couple of years.
Hill: Jason, what about you?
Moser: It's been a bit of a period of stagnation, I guess, for a lot of companies in the semiconductor space. That's for understandable reasons. We've seen a lot of saturation, they're on the handset side of things. But as 5G really starts to become more of a thing and we're going to start seeing that rollout here over the next several years, technology is just playing a much larger role in our lives than ever before. That's not going to change. It's all sorts of drivers in the tech space from 5G to things like immersive technology or Internet of Things, the automobile, and other tremendous opportunities. I think the semiconductor space is really poised for several years of productivity here. Obviously, the supply chain issues right now, the chip shortages are what's making headlines. There's plenty of reasons for that. A lot of it regarding the big demand for electronics and just changing business models and outsourcing production. The Intel news recently, I think, its fascinating trade conflicts. A lot of this stuff all came together and wants to really create the snag in the supply chain there. But I think the next several years with companies like Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM) and Qorvo (NASDAQ: QRVO), I think my sleeper here, Marvell Technology (NASDAQ: MRVL), a lot of companies out there that have been investing for this specific period of time, and I think they are coiled springs getting ready to pop.
Hill: It was 2004, the last time we saw the cicadas. If I'm doing my math correctly, it'll be the last time we see them until 2038. With that in mind, Ron, what is the stock that you would be willing to buy and hold until 2038?
Gross: I love this question. For me, it's got to be in the gene therapy space. So I'll go with Editas, a clinical stage biotechnology company that's focused on the CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing technology. That technology can remove, add, or alter individual genes or sections of the DNA sequence which one day could lead to a cure for a wide range of diseases. They're currently focused on diseases of the eye, blood diseases like sickle cell disease, and cancer. Even if things go really well, Editas won't be profitable for a while. Let's keep an eye on the balance sheet, $400 billion on there right now, so we're good for a while. Earlier in 2021, all of these stocks went on a wild ride. Editas pop to $100 per share. Now it's floated back down to Earth, around $40 per share. These are volatile. I always caution everybody. Maybe take a basket approach like I have if you want to invest in this sector, but I think Editas looks good for 17 more years.
Hill: Jason, what about you?
Moser: Putting this in the context of where am I going to be in 17 years makes this seem like a little bit more of a daunting task. Instead I'm looking at this through my daughter's eyes. They're going to be around 33 years old-ish once 17 years pass. I could see them still owning this stock and a stock that I own as well, Etsy. Much like Wayfair, I think Etsy has built a tremendous network. It has a ton of potential. To me, my daughters serve as the eyes for me here. Younger generations of shoppers care about this stuff. Local, small, unique, sustainable, those are the types of things that Etsy is really enabling in this two-sided network that really creates not only terrific marketplace for buyers but also a great place for sellers. There are a lot of small business implications thanks to Etsy's network. If you look at the numbers, they have sellers of 4.36 million now, buyers of 81.365 million. Mobile, they're making tremendous progress on that front as well. Then you look at things like Etsy Ads and Etsy Payments, I think this is going to be a marketplace that's going to be relevant for many, many years to come. So I'm looking forward to hanging on to these shares.
Hill: Ron, we got just over a minute left. One actual cleaning tip. Let's move away from the stocks. Let's get to the actual cleaning. What do you got?
Gross: To clean a barbecue grill, get your grill nice and hot, cut an onion in half, put it on the end of your drilling fork, and rub it all over the grill grate. The onion's juices will release and produce steam and the enzymes from the onion will help break down the oil and the grease on the grates.
Hill: Wow.
Gross: Yeah, there you go.
Hill: I'm excited to try that. All right. Mr. Moser, what do you got?
Moser: [laughs] Is that Ron Gross or Bill Nye The Science Guy? [laughs] Two quick things. Hey listen. Folks, get a cleaning crew every once in a while. I know it's not cheap, but spoil yourself. You do that a few times a year, it's just really nice. Save up little money and spoil yourself. Then on a more daily or weekly note, get one of those Swiffer Dusters with the refills. Those are just really handy. If you're working from home, you've got a few minutes here and there to run a duster around. Here's the tip. Dust the tops of the picture frames in your house and subtly note it to your spouse or significant other. [laughs] It goes a long way.
Hill: Few people have dug into the topic of personal finance as deeply as Jean Chatzky. She's the best-selling author several times over, and for more than 20 years, she was the financial editor for The Today Show. She's the CEO of HerMoney.com. Recently she talked with Megan Brinsfield, director of the advisory team at Motley Fool Wealth Management, about her latest book, Women with Money: The Judgment-Free Guide to Creating the Joyful, Less Stressed, Purposeful, and Yes, Rich Life You Deserve.
[...]
Megan Brinsfield: When we talk about the conversation of women and money, a lot of times we're focusing on the negative aspects of that or I would say challenges, in planning for women's longevity, for example, or addressing the gender pay gap. We definitely want to cover those topics. But I would love to start with some of the ways you see women gaining momentum in terms of financial literacy and stability. I know there are a few ways that you mentioned in your recent book, and I would love to start with that as background.
Jean Chatzky: For sure. Heading into the pandemic, we were making progress full steam ahead. There is no denying the fact that the pandemic has set us back a bit, and we can get into that. But if you look at the educational trends, they are in women's favor. 132 women graduated from college compared to 100 men on average over the past couple of years. Women are fast-forwarding when it comes to you getting graduate degrees as graduate degrees and those college degrees are going to drive increased earnings and increased power for women. When you look at the amount of money in the hands of women, it's been growing too, about 45% of the millionaires in this country are already women. We know there's a big intergenerational transfer of wealth that will happen over the next couple of decades. Women are expected to inherit the lion's share of that because we will inherit twice. We'll inherit both from our parents, but also from our husbands that we will outlive, that women's longevity issue that you alluded to. There are a lot of things working in our favor.
Brinsfield: I know you mentioned some of the setbacks that we've seen during the pandemic. Let's not pull any punches here. Let's talk about those as well because they are pretty severe, and I know just on your website recently, there were statistics about how long it's going to take for women to recover from some of these setbacks.
Chatzky: This is to really put us back about 20 years. It's because when a woman takes a step back from the workforce, she doesn't get back in at the same level, typically. It takes her seven years to get back to that level when she reenters the workforce. Because of three factors, the majority of the jobs lost during these pandemic have been jobs lost by women. In part, it's because of the industries that have been impacted. Restaurants, travel, hospitality, retail. In part, it's because of care-giving responsibilities. Women still have the lion's share of those care-giving responsibilities in their households. But it's also because if you are in a two-income family and somebody has to take a step back to keep the ship running on the right course at home, you're going to look at your financial resources. You're going to say, all right, how are we going to prosper best as a family? If the woman is the lower wage earner, which she still is most of the time, the woman is going to be the one to step out.
Brinsfield: Those care-giving responsibilities really do take a toll over the course of a woman's lifetime. I was looking at some data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics that points out that over someone's working career, if you compare male earnings to female earnings and account for those breaks in the workforce, that actually is a cumulative, roughly $1 million in difference in earning power over the course of your working career. That's because of child rearing, care-giving for a parent and care-giving for a spouse, which is quite significant. What are some of the ways that you've seen women taking steps to make up for that?
Chatzky: I think it's important to approach your financial life with a plan to capitalize on all the opportunities that you have to, both gain seniority, but also to stock away money for your future. We know that because of trends in longevity and because of the agenda wage gap, by the time a woman gets to retirement, she has substantially less in her retirement accounts than man typically does or does on average. Then she needs to make that money last a good five years longer. It's part of a planning process of getting started early, making sure that you're doing whatever you can to contribute to those retirement accounts, to put that money to work by investing, which I know you talk about every day, but we still have a bit of a confidence gap when it comes to women and investing.
Women keep way too much of our money in cash when we should be putting it to work in the markets. Even a study that just came out. I believe it was last week, but it may have been the week before from Annamaria Lusardi at, I think it's GW these days, looking at women and how our lack of financial confidence holds us back from investing. She gave women a look at two different financial literacy tests. One of those financial literacy tests offered the words I do not know or don't know as an option to answer the question, and the other did not. When it was the option, women chose it. When it was not the option, women got the answer right. That's a pretty good barometer, that it's confidence, it's not real knowledge that's holding us back. We have to get ourselves to the point where we invest consistently on a regular basis. Much of the work that we do at HerMoney is educating women with our content, with our newsletters, with our podcast on how do you make those decisions, how do you make them in a way where they don't monopolize your whole life, how do you find that financial advisor to help people get on the right track, to make a plan that can set you up for financial success.
The other very important consideration is that one to take a step back from work. Often, I think one parent in the family wants to stay home and can afford to do that while the family continues to prosper, and I'm all for that. But if it's a financial decision that you're making, if you're looking at the money that you're spending either on child care or on eldercare and you start to think, ""Well gosh, I'm spending as much on child care as I'm earning, it certainly doesn't make sense to be out in the workforce."" You need to think again, because we don't just lose wages when we take a step back from work. We lose Social Security credits, we lose money that we're putting into retirement accounts, we lose seniority, we lose access to our networks. It's a huge cost to pay. If you're just leveling the playing field as far as the money is concerned, the paycheck versus the cost of care, take another look at that decision before you take a step back.
Brinsfield: One of the big topics in planning for women is around longevity, and I know you mentioned before that there's burning the candle at both ends. Having fewer resources and needing to make those resources last longer. When women are planning for longevity in general, women tend to live five years longer than men, so in heterosexual relationships, at least, women are outliving their partners in a large majority of those cases. That combined with relying on a spouse during their lives to take the lead on finances can really leave women surprised and holding the bag, [laughs] to be quite honest, when they find themselves widowed. What resources either through AARP or other organizations that you're affiliated with have you found to be helpful in those situations?
Chatzky: Well, first of all, I think it's really important to try to get educated before you're in that situation. We should not be surprised by these things. I mean, yes, people are surprised when they lose a spouse young and it comes out of nowhere and that happens. But the reality is that the vast majority of us are going to be, and by us, I mean women, are going to be alone and need to manage our money personally and by ourselves at some point in our lives and you're so much better off learning how to do this when you're not grieving or not under tremendous pressure. If you are in a relationship where you are not involved in managing the money, you just got to get in there today, tomorrow, but not next year, not next month. It's sooner rather than later.
This is just something that has to happen and it's an evolution. It's not like you have to get your feet in there and do everything from job one, but you need to know where the money is, you need to know how much there is. You need to know who the important people are and you need to know how to move things around and how to make choices, and hopefully, you have a spouse that says, ""Yes, you're right. I don't know why we didn't do this a long time ago"". That said, there are a lot of resources. I mean, first I would point people to HerMoney. We publish content every single day. We publish a new podcast every week. We're a top 1% podcast, and we have these conversations about all aspects of your financial life for money is concerned. So it's not just investing, it's careers, it's protecting yourself and your life, it's raising money, smart children, it's all over the map.
The second resource that I would point people to, if you are on your own, unexpectedly, feeling like you need the help of a financial advisor, and particularly if you need the help of a financial advisor and your thinking, ""I just can't afford this,"" there's an organization called Savvy Ladies that you can reach out to, that will offer pro bono financial planning services and they're a wonderful resource, and there's so many more. We've got tons of great resources up at AARP. For women, in particular, I think because of this longevity question, and you know this because you've lived in the same world that I have for so many years, we focus so much on accumulation of assets. We save and save and invest and invest, and the decumulation phase, the how do I make my money last as long as I last, is as important a part of the equation and we don't pay nearly enough attention to it.
So I would say, if you're not sure how you are going to make your money last, that's when you go see a financial advisor and that's when you talk about things like what is going to be coming in, in addition to Social Security in the form of protected income that I can count on for the rest of my life. Is there a pension? Is there a strategy for making the money in the retirement accounts last? Is there a reason that I should be looking into converting some of that money in the retirement accounts into a paycheck using annuities or using other tools that I can do to do that so that I don't have to worry about the fear of running out of money before I run out of time? Because I know, and I'm sure you know, that is the No. 1 fear on the minds of women.
Brinsfield: One thing that I think it's often overlooked in discussions about just progress for women financially, is the help that we need from our male counterparts to make that progress. In the example of, ""My spouse handles all of the finances"", or ""I'm just not interested,"" I have a lot of coworkers that are in that position. I always go, ""Where is your wife?"" when we're talking about finances and they go, ""She's not interested,"" and pushing them on that and go like, ""Well, just ask them to come to the meeting,"" or ""they don't have to say anything,"" create a low barrier to entry. But what are some of the ways that you've seen people step up and partner to bring women into the fold on these conversations?
Chatzky: I think an emotional plea is the best plea. What you're really saying is if something were to happen to me, and statistically, as a guy, something is going to happen to me before it happens to you, I don't want you to be lost. I don't want you to feel like you don't know what to do next. We've spent a long time building this family, building this life, you need to understand this so that you can carry on. Just like I would need to understand it without you and there are things about what you do that I don't understand and maybe you can help me with those. I'm not asking you to take over, I'm just asking you to be my partner in this as you're my partner in the rest of our life.
Brinsfield: Absolutely, and I appreciate that so much when I see our male counterparts taking those actions and starting those conversations as well. I'd love to talk about your podcast. It's been around for a minute and I know I've enjoyed it for a long time. Over the years, have there been any surprises that you've found in either guests that you've had on the show or content that you've covered that you might like to highlight here for our viewers?
Chatzky: Boy, there have been so many wonderful guests. I've just been so fortunate to talk to amazing people. One of my recent favorites was an episode with a doctor named Romie Mushtaq. She's a neurologist and she specializes in helping us calm down our busy brains, and I think during this pandemic her techniques have been so helpful because we're stressed. Even if financially we're doing OK, we're suffering from pandemic fatigue, and so I would say, she offered up a couple of meditations and things that were really helpful to me. You mentioned on the subject of the unlevel playing field that many of us have with our spouses, particularly when it comes to housework and caregiving. Eve Rodsky was a guest, she wrote the book Fair Play, and she was terrific on how you square that; how do you really take what's going on in your household and rejigger it so that it does work for everybody. Let me think. Karen Finerman, she's on CNBC's Fast Money. A lot of people will know her from there. We were talking about the volatility in the markets, and Bitcoin, and SPACs, and GameStop, and what has happened to make the market so volatile and so odd during this pandemic, and she was a terrific guest. I could go on and on. We've done almost 300 podcasts, we've been around for five years. People I know dig back into our archives and start at the beginning, which is terrific. I think the very first one we did was Gretchen Rubin on happiness and money, and it's still an episode that is well worth listening to.
