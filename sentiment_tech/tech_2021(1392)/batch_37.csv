SHANGHAI, March 31 (Reuters) - Smartphone maker Xiaomi has joined a rush of Chinese tech companies venturing into the semiconductor sector, announcing on Wednesday a new chip to help smartphone cameras process images.
Xiaomi's Surge C1 chip was developed after an earlier unsuccessful attempt at producing a smartphone processor and comes as Chinese internet giants, automakers, and even home appliance firms invest heavily in semiconductor research and development.
While all remain in the early stages, their drive dovetails with Chinese government policy to boost the domestic semiconductor sector as demand for chips soars.
The initiative has become ever-more critical, with a global chip shortage crimping supplies and U.S. sanctions hobbling Huawei Technologies Co Ltd HWT.UL, once China's top smartphone maker and for a time the only company capable of producing high-end smartphone processors.
The trend is a global one, with major U.S companies including Alphabet Inc's Google GOOGL.O, Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O and Facebook Inc FB.O, also investing in their own chipmaking efforts.
BIG PUSH
In addition to Xiaomi, Chinese Android phone maker Oppo is following Huawei and Apple Inc's AAPL.O lead by developing its own chips for handsets.
The company says it has developed power management that it uses for a line of in-house flash chargers, and is currently conducting R&D for radio frequency (RF) and bluetooth chips.
Large Chinese internet companies, by comparison, have focused their efforts toward cloud computing and artificial intelligence, targeting a market dominated primarily by Intel Inc INTC.O and Nvidia Corp NVDA.O.
Search provider Baidu Inc 9888.HK, the earliest entrant into chips among China's web giants, has two chip projects.
The company established its Kunlun division for smart vehicles chips in 2018, and is set to mass produce its Kunlun II chip this year, according to its CTO. The unit recently secured funding valuing it at about $2 billion, according to Reuters.
Honghu, a unit making voice recognition chips, placed its first component in a Baidu smart speaker in 2020.
Alibaba Group 9988.HK, meanwhile, launched its Pingtouge chip division in 2018 after acquiring a domestic startup. In 2019 it came out with its first AI Chip, the Hanguang 800, which the company said it intended for use in its own cloud computing ecosystem.
Social media rivals Tencent Holdings 0700.HK and ByteDance have entered the sector more slowly. Tencent has made steady investments in chip startup Enflame, while ByteDance has ramped up hiring for developing Arm-based server chips, Reuters reported.
The internet giants' forays into chips mirror similar moves into chip building by Google, Amazon and Facebook, both in terms of opportunities and dilemmas, analysts say.
While self-developing chips could help companies reduce costs and improve performance, it could pose long-term economies of scale problems, says Stewart Randall, who tracks the semiconductor sector at consultancy Intralink.
""They're some of the world's largest buyers of chips so it makes sense to make their own. They'll either be forced to sell to their competitors, or will only be able to sell to themselves.""
As cars get smarter, chips have become a key component in products from sensors to control units. China's auto industry, which suffered from chip supply shortage in recent months, are also now developing their own chip products.
ECARX, an auto tech startup backed by Geely's chairman and Baidu 9888.HK, plans to supply products with 7 nanometer (nm) chip as early as next year through its joint venture with Arm China.
China auto chip startup Horizon Robotics raised $900 million from BYD 1211.HK, Great Wall 601633.SS and other industry companies.
Even appliance makers have launched their own chip divisions.
Air conditioner makers Midea Group Co Ltd 000333.SZ and Gree Electric Appliances of Zhuhai 000651.SZ, as well as microwave manufacturer Galanz and refrigerator maker Haier Smart Home Co 660690.SS have R&D units for chips and in some cases have already placed them in products.
More so than the tech companies, appliance makers can benefit by designing their own chips as they rely on comparatively more mature technology, which can both reduce purchase costs and keep their supply chain localised.
""The shortage has made them realise that some of their products can be fully created within the mainland and it will not be that expensive,"" said Ivan Platonov, an analyst at research firm Equal Ocean.

2021-03-30 00:00:00+00:00,Why Intel's Foundry Services Push Makes Sense,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-intels-foundry-services-push-makes-sense-2021-03-30,,,"Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) CEO Pat Gelsinger, who took charge of the chip giant earlier this year, laid out his plan on March 23 to return the company to its former glory. Intel has faced chronic issues with its in-house manufacturing technology, leading to long delays and opening the door for rival AMD to win significant market share. The company also no longer has any kind of manufacturing edge over third-party foundries such as Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE: TSM) (TSMC).
Instead of caving in to pressure from an activist investor and spinning off its manufacturing operations, Intel is doubling down on what it views as a key competitive advantage. Intel will continue to manufacture the majority of its products in-house, fueled by a $20 billion investment in two new facilities in Arizona.
Those new factories will also support Intel's new foundry services business unit. Intel has offered to manufacture some chips for other companies in the past, but that effort never really got off the ground.
""Our past attempts were somewhat half-hearted,"" Gelsinger said in a presentation to analysts, as reported by Bloomberg.
This time around, Intel appears fully committed to becoming a major player in the foundry business. The company will be able to offer manufacturing capacity in the U.S. and Europe, and customers will be able to make use of Intel's intellectual-property portfolio, including its x86 cores.
Given Intel's previous failure at getting a foundry business off the ground, along with its years-long struggles with manufacturing, the push into offering foundry services may seem unexpected. But given how profitable TSMC has become, it makes perfect sense.

A cash machine
Intel's core business of manufacturing PC and server chips is highly profitable, even with its manufacturing missteps. The company generated $20 billion of revenue, a gross margin of 56.8%, an operating margin of 29.5%, and net income of $5.9 billion in the fourth quarter of 2020. Intel is still a cash machine.
In the past, it made little sense to use manufacturing capacity to make chips for third parties when it was more lucrative to use that capacity for its own chips. But things have changed. Intel's profits are impressive, but so are foundry market leader TSMC's.
TSMC reported revenue of $12.1 billion in its latest quarter, up 29% from the prior-year period. The company managed a gross margin of 53.4% and an operating margin of 42.1%, leading to net income of about $4.8 billion. In other words, TSMC is producing nearly as much net profit as Intel on quite a bit less revenue, solely by making products for other companies.
If Intel succeeds in becoming a major provider of foundry services, margin could potentially improve, given how profitable TSMC has become. Intel faces a lot of challenges: Its manufacturing difficulties remain, competitors may not want to turn to Intel for manufacturing, and it will take huge investments to overcome the manufacturing lead that TSMC has built. But the foundry business could be very profitable for Intel in the long run if everything goes right.
Companies that have given up on semiconductor manufacturing, including AMD and IBM, have done so because the investments required to stay competitive simply didn't make sense given the volume of chips those companies were producing. If Intel stuck with only manufacturing its own products, it may have eventually run into the same issue. By offering foundry services, Intel can make sure it has enough volume running through its factories to be able to make the massive investments necessary to keep pace with TSMC.
Intel's push into foundry services may seem odd, given its recent struggles with manufacturing, but it may be the only way to justify the massive investments Intel will have to make to regain its manufacturing edge. And foundry services could become a highly profitable business in its own right for Intel if everything goes according to plan.

Among technology investors, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is one of the go-to names investors have flocked to in recent years. That’s no surprise. After all, AMD stock is one of the most consistent growth plays on the NASDAQ over the past five years.

How consistent? Investors who bought AMD stock five years ago have booked returns of more than 2,200% over this time frame.
That’s not bad. However, whether or not this growth story can continue is another question.
In this article, I’m going to discuss why I’m very bullish on AMD stock right now. Specifically, I’m going to focus on the market share capture potential of what is still a “small” player in the semiconductor space.
Don’t Be Fooled by AMD’s Size
AMD is the smallest of the “big 3” in the U.S. CPU and GSU market. Its rivals Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) and Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) have market capitalizations roughly three-times that of AMD. These companies also own a significant market share today that AMD is yearning to capture.

8 Small-Cap Stocks With Plenty of Cred
However, the company believes it is on the cusp of continuing to nab market share from its competitors at a relatively rapid pace. According to AMD’s investor presentation, the four pillars AMD’s management team would like investors to focus on are:
High-performance computing leadership
Disruptive solutions combining CPUs and GPUs
Strong and predictable execution
Best-in-class growth franchise
I think that just about sums up AMD stock. I’m going to go home now.
Just kidding.
Indeed, I think these central tenets of AMD’s strategic outlook can really be split into two buckets: product superiority and predictable growth. Let’s look at these closer.
Product Superiority a Key Competitive Advantage
Product superiority is the key factor I think most AMD investors focus on.
Indeed, the company’s Ryzen mobile and desktop processors are branded by the company as “the world’s best laptop processors” and “the world’s fastest gaming processors.” That’s not bad, even if AMD does say so itself.
Additionally, the company’s GPU segment (where it’s really struggled) is looking positive. Driven by extremely high demand from growth in computing power needs (think cryptocurrency mining), stocking issues have plagued the sector. Indeed, many believe these shortages will last until mid-2021.
AMD’s product line has become much more competitive with Nvidia’s, though AMD is lagging in terms of market share here. However, if AMD can sufficiently ramp up production to meet this excess demand, there’s an argument that can be made for some market share capture.
Finally, the recent news coming from Dell Technologies (NYSE:DELL) that the company will be using AMD Epyc chips in five of its 17 server models being released in 2021 is a big deal.
It’s believed Dell’s shift to providing excellent performance at a reasonable price is a key factor in integrating such a high percentage of AMD chips in one of its largest server launches in history. Customers are climbing aboard AMD, for good reason.
Growth Key to Owning AMD Stock Long Term
Over the past 12 months, AMD posted revenues just shy of $10 billion. That’s up 45% over 2019 numbers. Not bad growth, indeed.
Importantly, net income more than doubled over the past year. What once looked like an unachievably-high valuation multiple is now within reason.
Accordingly, many fundamental-oriented investors may be enticed by this growth play. The company’s forward projections are just as enticing.
In 2021, AMD’s forward revenue guidance is for 37% growth. While not as good as 2020, that’s still a heck of a jump. Any company growing at this pace (and at this size) deserves a second look.
Indeed, if the company can continue to capture market share as it has been in recent years, such projections are very realistic. AMD’s forward revenue of $13.4 billion and gross profit of $6.3 billion (based on forward expectations of a 47% gross margin) would make this company’s valuation even more attractive.

2021-03-30 00:00:00+00:00,3 Surefire Stocks to Hold for the Long Term,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-surefire-stocks-to-hold-for-the-long-term-2021-03-30,,,"It's easy to claim to be a long-term investor during a bull market, but that optimism can quickly fade once a bear market starts. During those times, it's more helpful to remember that the market has consistently generated bigger gains for investors who managed to hold firm through the peaks and troughs than for those investors who tried to time the market.
With that investing advice in mind, I'd like to highlight a trio of evergreen growth stocks that should make it easier to stick to the plan as they have a good chance of continuing to climb in price over the next few decades. They are: LVMH Moet Hennessy L.V. (OTC: LVMUY), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM), and PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ: PYPL). Let's find out a bit more about these three surefire stocks.
Image source: Getty Images.
1. LVMH
LVMH is the world's largest luxury company. The French company's portfolio, which is spread across 75 holdings, includes iconic brands like Louis Vuitton, Dior, Hennessy, Sephora, and Tiffany & Co.
LVMH is a great long-term investment for two straightforward reasons: Affluent customers usually continue shopping through economic upturns and downturns, and high-end brands face less competition than cheaper brands.
LVMH's revenue declined 17% in 2020, with a 16% drop in organic sales, as its profit from recurring operations slipped 28%. That slowdown seems bleak, but it was mainly caused by pandemic-related closures.
On the bright side, LVMH's fashion and leather goods segment, which generates nearly half its revenue, recovered in the second half of 2020, with accelerating sales in China and the U.S. Its other businesses, including the selective retailing group that houses Sephora and its DFS stores, should also stabilize after the pandemic ends.
That's why analysts expect LVMH's revenue and earnings to rise 25% and 63%, respectively, this year. LVMH's stock might not seem cheap at 36 times forward earnings, but I believe its resilience and well-diversified portfolio of high-end brands easily justify that slight premium.
2. TSMC
In the past, many processing chipmakers manufactured their own chips. But as the chips became smaller and more difficult to manufacture, many chipmakers instead outsourced their production to third-party foundries better equipped to execute the chip-making process efficiently.
Today, only three foundries can manufacture the world's most advanced chips: TSMC, Samsung, and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC). However, Intel -- which mainly produces its own chips at its foundries -- has gradually fallen behind TSMC and Samsung in the ""process race"" to create smaller and more powerful chips.
Image source: Getty Images.
TSMC remains slightly ahead of Samsung in that race, which makes it the biggest ""pure-play"" chip foundry in the world.
Most ""fabless"" chipmakers, including AMD, Qualcomm, and Apple, now rely on TSMC to manufacture their newest 5nm and 7nm chips. Even Intel, which is eager to resolve its own manufacturing issues, recently agreed to outsource some of its chips to TSMC.
In other words, TSMC is becoming the ultimate gatekeeper to the world's semiconductor market, and the surging demand for chips worldwide will likely drive its stock much higher.
TSMC's revenue and earnings rose 25% and 50%, respectively, in 2020. Analysts expect its revenue and earnings to grow another 20% and 17% respectively, this year -- and its stock still looks reasonably valued at 27 times forward earnings.
3. PayPal
PayPal is one of the world's largest online payment companies. Its number of active accounts grew 24% to 377 million in 2020, its number of transactions jumped 25% to 15.4 billion, and its TPV (total payment volume) surged 31% to $936 billion.
PayPal's peer-to-peer payments app, Venmo, accounted for $159 billion of its TPV during the year, up 56% from a year ago. Its merchant services volume also increased 33% as businesses shifted more of their payments online to offset their lower brick-and-mortar sales throughout the pandemic.
PayPal's revenue and earnings grew 22% and 31%, respectively, in 2020. It expects its revenue and earnings to grow another 19% and 17%, respectively, this year.
PayPal also started allowing its users to buy, hold, and sell Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies last year. That move won't make it a major Bitcoin player like Square anytime soon, but it ensures that its payment platform will keep pace with the latest fintech trends.
PayPal's stock might seem pricey at over 40 times forward earnings, but its first-mover's advantage in online payments, its sprawling presence in over 200 countries, and its robust growth rates all support its higher valuation and make it a great long-term investment.

2021-03-29 00:00:00+00:00,"Fridges, microwaves fall prey to global chip shortage",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/fridges-microwaves-fall-prey-to-global-chip-shortage-2021-03-29,,,"By Josh Horwitz
SHANGHAI, March 29 (Reuters) - A global shortage of chips that has rattled production lines at car companies and squeezed stockpiles at gadget makers, is now leaving home appliance makers unable to meet demand, according to the president of Whirlpool Corp WHR.N in China.
The U.S. based company, one of the world's largest white goods firm, is falling behind on exports to Europe and the United States from China, by as much as 25% on some months, Jason Ai told Reuters in Shanghai.
""It's a perfect storm,"" he said on the sidelines of the Appliance and World Electronics Expo.
""On the one hand we have to satisfy domestic demand for appliances, on the other hand we're facing an explosion of export orders. As far as chips go, for those of us in China, it was inevitable.""
The company has struggled to secure enough microcontrollers, simple processors that power over half of its products including microwaves, refrigerators, and washing machines.
While the chip shortage has affected a range of high-end suppliers like Qualcomm Inc QCOM.O, it originated and remains most severe for mature technologies, for example power-management chips used in cars.
The chip shortage, which began in earnest in late December, was caused in part as automakers miscalculated demand and pandemic-fuelled sales of smartphones and laptops surged. It forced carmakers including General Motors GM.N to cut production, and increased costs for smartphone makers such as Xiaomi Corp 1810.HK.
And with every company that uses chips in its products panic buying to shore up its stockpile, the shortage has blindsided not just Whirlpool but other appliance makers too.
Hangzhou Robam Appliances Co Ltd 002508.SZ, a Chinese white goods maker with over 26,000 employees, had to delay the release of a new high-end stove vent by four months because it couldn't source enough microcontrollers.
""Most of our products are already optimised for smart home use, so of course we need a lot of chips,"" said Dan Ye, marketing director at Robam.
He added that the company had found it easier to source chips from China than overseas, prompting it to re-evaluate future supplies.
""The chips we use in our products aren't the most cutting edge. Domestic chips can satisfy our needs completely.""
Already cutthroat, profit margins at white goods firms are getting further squeezed due to the shortage.
Robin Rao, planning department director of China's Sichuan Changhong Electric Co Ltd 600839.SS, said lengthy replacement cycles for appliances, coupled with intense competition and a slowing real estate market, have long kept profit margins thin.
""But because of these core components and chips, our supply chain capital costs have increased.""
To deal with the shortage of microprocessors and flash memory chips, Dreame Technology - a vacuum cleaner brand funded by Xiaomi - cut its marketing budget and hired extra staff just to manage relationships with suppliers.
Dreame has also spent ""several million yuan"" to test out chips that could serve as alternatives to the ones it typically uses, said Frank Wang, the company's marketing director.
""We're working to have deeper control of our suppliers, and have even invested in a few suppliers,"" he said.

Barely a month into his role, Intel Corp. (NASDAQ:INTC) CEO Pat Gelsinger announced last week the company’s pivot to spend $20 billion on two new chip factories at its facilities in Arizona starting in 2024.
In another split from the company’s recent past, Gelsinger said Intel will begin to rely on industry giants like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (NYSE:TSM) and others to build specialized components of its chips starting in 2023. Intel will also join its own chip-production operations in the U.S. and Europe into a separate division called Intel Foundry Services. And the company is starting to court major customers again like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and competitor Qualcomm Inc. (NASDAQ:QCOM).
The moves come at a critical time for the semiconductor industry, which is dealing with a global chip shortage I wrote about back in February. The shortage is hitting auto parts and car manufacturers, forcing companies like Ford Motor Co. (NYSE:F), General Motors Co. (NYSE:GM) to idle plants and shrink revenue forecasts for the year.
Intel itself has seen its market share shrink and its share price lag over the past year as the company lost key customers, and suffered heightened competition and missteps in producing more advanced chips. In 1990, the U.S. had 37% of the world’s semi-conductor manufacturing capacity. That figure is now at about 12%, so I applaud Intel’s ambitions to bring back more capacity to the U.S.

8 Hot Stocks to Buy for Your Well-Diversified Portfolio
Over the past year, the stock has risen 17%, while the industry bellwether, the iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SOXX), soared 95%.
Intel’s stock is currently a “Sell” in my Portfolio Grader with a Total Grade of “D,” as well as a “D” Quantitative Grade, which gauges institutional buying pressure under the stock.
Intel just doesn’t yet have the superior fundamentals I look for before I recommend a stock.
However, I am confident that the crème de la crème of the semiconductor stocks are poised to take advantage of the global supply crunch in the coming months. Especially Taiwanese semiconductor companies that create the chips that go into the LED and OLED displays in cars.
Case in point: United Micro Electronics Corporation (NYSE:UMC). I recommended the stock to my Growth Investor subscribers back on October 30, 2020.
Over the past six months, the stock has soared 97%, compared to the 32% gain for the iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF.
In its latest announcement on Jan. 27, the company reported an earnings surge of 166.7% year-over-year, and a whopping 166.7% earnings surprise.
As you can see below, UMC is a “Strong Buy” right now in my Portfolio Grader, where it also earns a Total Grade of “A” and a Quantitative Grade of “A.”
Stick with Fundamentally Superior Stocks
Of course, my Growth Investor Buy Lists are chock-full of fundamentally superior stocks like UMC.
My average Growth Investor stock has had its earnings revised 16.7% higher in the past three months. Typically, positive analyst revisions precede future earnings surprises. In addition, my average stock is characterized by 66.1% annual sales growth and 276.4% earnings growth, so I am expecting a spectacular first-quarter earnings announcement season for my Growth Investor stocks, with my companies set to post wave-after-wave of positive earnings results.
The upcoming earnings season is especially important because it will represent peak sales and earnings for my Growth Investor stocks and the overall stock market due to easy YOY comparisons. Simply put, I look for many stocks to post earnings surprises, which, in turn, will drop kick and drive my Growth Investor stocks higher.
And now couldn’t be a better time to join Growth Investor. You see, today I’m releasing four new stocks in my Growth Investor April Monthly Issue — two High Growth stocks and two Elite Dividend Payers. Every stock earns an A-rating in Portfolio Grader, and my Elite Dividend Payers also hold an A-rating in Dividend Grader, making them rare AA-rated stocks. ( For full details, click here now.)
So not only will you be well-positioned to benefit from what should be a phenomenal first-quarter earnings season, but it will also help get you on the right side of a great chasm that’s opening up in America. On one side is a new aristocracy that’s amassing more wealth, more quickly than any other group in American history. For people like me, the one percent, life has never been better, more prosperous.
On the other side, the opposite is happening. Wealth is flowing out of the pockets of ordinary Americans at an unprecedented rate.
What’s happening is only going to gather in strength over the coming decades. It certainly won’t weaken.
Few Americans even know that any of this is going on. I’ve never seen anyone from my side of the chasm step forward to explain any of these things.
It’s why I put together this video. In it, I’ll lay out exactly what is happening, including several key steps every American should take right now. It doesn’t matter if you have $500 in savings or $5 million. You can benefit from the information in this video.
It’s free to watch and by doing so I know you’ll be ahead of everyone else struggling to understand what is really going on.
Sincerely,
Louis Navellier
On the date of publication, Louis Navellier had positions in TSM and UMC.
Louis Navellier, who has been called “one of the most important money managers of our time,” has broken the silence in this shocking “tell all” video… exposing one of the most shocking events in our country’s history… and the one move every American needs to make today.

2021-03-29 00:00:00+00:00,Qualcomm (QCOM) Vs NVIDIA Corp (NVDA): Which Of These Semiconductor Stocks Is A Better Buy?,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/qualcomm-qcom-vs-nvidia-corp-nvda%3A-which-of-these-semiconductor-stocks-is-a-better-buy,,,"Semiconductor Stocks Are a Hot Topic Among Investors This Month.
Semiconductor stocks are gaining much attention among traders as demands continue to soar. According to World Semiconductor Trade Statistics (WSTS), global semiconductor sales increased by 6.5% to $439 billion in 2020. As many of the top semiconductor stocks did not perform well in recent weeks, this presents an opportunity for investors to buy at a lower price to hold in the long run.
If you have not noticed, prices of electronic hardware and mobile devices are going through the roof thanks to the global chip shortage. This has hampered production, with major companies like Nio (NYSE: NIO) and General Motors (NYSE: GM) halting the production of their electric vehicles. Such news is a disaster for automakers. But it highlighted how dependent industries are on semiconductor companies to further technology and digitalization. More importantly, it also has shown the potential for top semiconductor stocks to grow as this dependency continues.
Such global chip shortage dubbed “chippageddon” by some may recover as soon as COVID-related demand is met and chip companies ramp up their production. Investors should also take note of the importance of semiconductors with the buzz going around non-fungible tokens (NFTs) as well as skyrocketing prices of cryptocurrencies. But instead of dabbling into these topics, we are going to focus on the two semiconductor giants, namely Qualcomm Inc. (NASDAQ: QCOM) and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA).
[Read More] Top 5 Things To Watch In The Stock Market This Week
Qualcomm (QCOM)
Qualcomm, the American-based semiconductor behemoth that rivals fellow chipmaker companies such as Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) and Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE: TSM) requires no further introduction. Speaking at China Development Forum in Beijing, Qualcomm CEO Steve Mollenkopf has highlighted that he is “seeing improvements” in efforts to reduce chip shortage as demands for older chips are easier to be fulfilled. While this may not mean that the chip shortage predicament is at its nigh, it is seeing much-required improvement.
The company is also reportedly working on a gaming console that could rival Nintendo’s (OTCMKTS: NTDOY) Switch platform. Rumored to be powered by a Qualcomm 800-series chipset, the console is also designed to run Android 12 as a custom launcher. The device could feature many of Switch’s designs – removable joysticks, expandable memory card slot, cellular support, haptic feedback accelerometers, and so on.
But what makes it stand out is the possibility of 5G support thanks to the company’s 800-series chips. Set to release next year, the new Qualcomm console could be a new favorite among gamers. In comparison, the Switch is still running on an already outdated Tegra chipset.
QCOM Stock Underperforming Despite Strong Financials
Numbers from Qualcomm’s recent Q1 2021 financial report for the quarter ended December 2020 showed positive results. Revenue for the quarter was $8.23 billion as sales rose 63% year-over-year and earnings grew 119%. CEO Steve Mollenkopf also announced a 5% increase in the company’s quarterly cash dividend, effective after March 25th. The quarterly cash dividend will increase to $0.68 as annualized dividend payout is raised to $2.72 per share of common stock.

The recent earnings release also revealed that chip sales are growing steadily for the company. Revenue from mobile phone chips saw an increase of 79% year-over-year to $4.22 billion. The company’s RF front-end chips which are used in 5G technology as well as Qualcomm’s modem also rose by 157% from the previous year. Despite having an increased sales and revenue, Qualcomm’s stock performance tells a different story.
As mentioned earlier, QCOM stock is among semiconductor shares that did not perform well this month. QCOM stock saw an over 17% dip since February, making some investors nervous. That said, this presents an opportunity for traders to buy QCOM stock at a bargain. This comes as Qualcomm continues to become the primary producer for 5G chipsets in mobile phones. Should the global chip production recover, expect Qualcomm to turnaround to become one of the best semiconductor stocks as chip demands are met.

NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA)
NVIDIA is a primary graphics processing unit (GPU) maker with its products implemented in consoles, computers, the automotive market, and even cryptocurrency miners. For those unfamiliar, NVIDIA is a multinational tech company that designs graphics processing units and systems on a chip (SoCs).
Graphics on games and animation alike have leaped from bit pixels to larger-than-life designs thanks to a continuous improvement of processing architecture and continuous R&D. One thing that’s very prominent in today’s GPU market is the exorbitant street prices on all generations of GPU cards.
Not only has the global chip shortage slowed down GPU production. But a massive demand among cryptocurrency miners has surged GPU prices to an all-time high. While this may be detrimental among end-users, NVIDIA stands to benefit the most. That’s because its GPU stocks sell out the moment they are out of the factory.
A Prized Product Among Crypto-Miners
To satiate demands from crypto-miners while appeasing the wrath of gamers for the shortage of NVIDIA GPUs in the market, NVIDIA has made two major moves. Firstly, the company has released a new product called a cryptocurrency mining processor (CMP). The CMPs are a hit among miners. For instance, Hut 8 Mining Corp (OTCMKTS: HUTMF) invested $30 million to procure CMPs for their crypto-mining endeavors.
Source: TD Ameritrade TOS
Secondly, NVIDIA has released its mid-low range 3060 GPU cards. These have a feature to throttle card performance by half when used for crypto-mining. Such effort became futile, partly due to the company’s mistake when it released a graphics driver that overrides the feature. Moreover, resourceful crypto-miners have found a way to fix the throttle by plugging the HDMI port with a dummy plug.
A never-ending demand has benefited Nvidia, as the company reported record revenue for its Q4 2021 ended January 2021. Quarterly revenue was $5.00 billion, an increase of 61% year over year. Revenue for the fiscal year was also another record for the company at $16.68 billion, up 53% a year earlier. “Demand for GeForce RTX 30 Series GPUs is incredible. NVIDIA RTX has started a major upgrade cycle as gamers jump to ray tracing, DLSS, and AI,” highlighted Jensen Huang, CEO of NVIDIA.

Bottom Line: QCOM Stock VS NVDA Stock
While both company’s production has dampened from chip shortages, they certainly have their own merits and development in their pipeline. Should the global chip shortage continue, NVDA stock could stand to gain the most. That’s because both GPUs and CMPs will continue to sell as fast as the company can make them. However, this is also dependent on current cryptocurrency prices. After all, a major dip in cryptocurrency prices would dampen demand from crypto-miners.
If the chip shortage is relieved, QCOM stock could see its value rising as the company can push production back to its optimal levels. More importantly, the company can continue to maximize the production of chips with 5G implementation. This is crucial not only on mobile phones but on other digital communication devices as well. The question is, which of these semiconductor stocks are you putting your money on, given such a predicament?

2021-03-27 00:00:00+00:00,Stop Trying to Get Rich Quick and Upgrade Your Investing Strategy Instead,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/stop-trying-to-get-rich-quick-and-upgrade-your-investing-strategy-instead-2021-03-27,,,"It's easy to believe that dabbling in stocks is an easy way to build wealth. The financial media highlights the market's biggest winners. Many brokerage firms offer unlimited commission-free trades as well as tools that encourage frequent trading. Collectively, they send a message: You're not doing enough, or doing well enough quickly enough.
Such a mindset is ultimately a trap, though. Too many people, in their effort to ""get rich quick,"" end up doing themselves more harm than good. Rushed decisions lead to costly mistakes.
With this as the backdrop, here are four tips that will help you make more money in the long run, but with less work than you're doing now.
Image source: Getty Images.
1. With trading, less is more
You may hear tales of fellow traders scoring big gains in short periods of time. Just know that these success stories, if they're true, are the exception to the norm. Although the estimates vary a bit from one source to the next, about 90% of traders -- so-called pattern day-traders, mostly -- lose money from their trading activities.
Why don't you hear about this majority of people? Brokerage firms certainly don't want to frighten prospective customers off, but it's not a particularly beneficial truth for the investment media industry either. Perception is powerful, even if the scary statistic is misleading in itself.
The simple solution is, don't try to outmaneuver the market. Most of your gains should come from riding the market's long-term rising tide.
2. Don't sweat P/E ratios too much
The logic is sound enough. The amount of money you're putting at risk investing in a company's stock should be weighed against that company's current and potential per-share profits. The lower the price-to-earnings comparison (or P/E ratio), the more bang you're getting for your buck.
The fact is, however, there's very little correlation between low P/E ratios and a stock's performance. Low-cost stocks tend to remain low-cost stocks, and relatively expensive stocks generally remain expensive.
That's not to suggest investors should never think about valuations. But a high valuation isn't always a dealbreakers.
Fun fact: In his book How to Make Money in Stocks, William J. O'Neil (of Investors Business Daily fame) lays out seven tested and proven criteria for picking winners. Not one of these seven standards considers an earnings-based valuation.
3. Think of your portfolio as a whole
While not without its ups and downs, NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been a big winner of late. Ditto for rival Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD). Even shares of Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) have pushed past the company's foundry challenges to dish out gains; the stock just hit a record high. Investors would have done well with any of them.
That doesn't mean an investor should own all of them at the same time, though.
Admittedly, this scenario is an extreme case of too much concentration in one sector, and not enough diversification. Less obvious concentrations aren't uncommon, though. Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG), and social networking giant Facebook (NASDAQ: FB) are all seemingly different kinds of companies on the surface. Under the hood, however, these three stocks are apt to rise and fall together as they're all ultimately dependent on the financial health of the exact same consumers.
In other words, diversify... not just at a sector level but at a style and category level as well.
4. Don't bother trying to time the market
Finally, as tempting as it may be, resist the urge to cash out at what seems like a market high. At the same time, don't wait to step into a new position until you think we're at or near a major low. The odds of precisely picking these turns is low. Indeed, it's unlikely you'll get anywhere near enough to them to do you any good.
And missing the mark by just a couple of days can prove more devastating than you might imagine.
Take last year for instance. The S&P 500 was able to hammer out a nice gain of 16.3% in calendar 2020, overcoming a steep sell-off in February and March that finally ended on March 23. Two of the three best days for the S&P 500 last year, however, were March 24 and March 26. If you take those two days' gains out of the mix, the index would have gained less than 5% in 2020.
Granted, had you also missed last year's worst day (the 12% sell-off suffered on March 16), the gain works its way back up to 15%. You're talking about pinpointing one day's results and the likely pivot point while in the midst of a politically and emotionally charged pandemic, though. That's just not going to happen.
Skip the headache. Just take your lumps and enjoy the rebounds, knowing that time will heal all wounds.

2021-03-26 00:00:00+00:00,Better Buy: Skyworks Solutions vs. Intel,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/better-buy%3A-skyworks-solutions-vs.-intel-2021-03-26,,,"Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ: SWKS) and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) represent two very different ways to invest in the semiconductor market.
Skyworks, which generated over half of its revenue from Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) last year, produces wireless and radio frequency chips for a wide range of markets. Intel is the world's largest manufacturer of x86 central processing units (CPUs) for PCs and data centers.
Image source: Getty Images.
Skyworks' stock nearly doubled over the past 12 months as rising sales of 5G devices -- including Apple's iPhone 12 -- boosted demand for its chips. Intel's stock advanced less than 20% during the same period due to ongoing concerns about its R&D and manufacturing issues. But will Skyworks keep generating bigger returns than Intel throughout the rest of the year?
Which chipmaker is growing faster?
Intel grew its revenue at a much faster rate than Skyworks over the past three years.

Skyworks' revenue declined in 2019 as sales of smartphones decelerated worldwide. That slowdown, which was caused by the market's commoditization and longer upgrade cycles, was exacerbated by trade sanctions against its major customer Huawei.
Skyworks seemed poised for a recovery in 2020, but the pandemic disrupted its top-end markets in the first half of the year. It finally returned to growth in the fourth quarter as the disruptions ended and orders for its Sky5 5G chips accelerated.
Skyworks expects its content share gains in 5G devices, especially the new iPhone, and the recovering auto and industrial markets to boost its sales this year. Skyworks' revenue surged 69% year over year in the first quarter of 2021, and analysts expect its revenue to increase 47% for the full year.

Intel's core PC and data center businesses initially seemed stable, but its sales of data center chips declined year over year in the second half of the year due to slower enterprise spending throughout the pandemic. The decline partly offset its stronger sales of PC CPUs for remote workers.
Intel's ongoing chip shortage, which was caused by R&D and manufacturing issues at its internal foundry, also resulted in market share losses to AMD (NASDAQ: AMD), which outsourced its chip production to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) (NYSE: TSM) instead of manufacturing them internally.
Intel recently hired Pat Gelsinger, a veteran Intel engineer who previously led VMware (NYSE: VMW), as its new CEO to navigate the crisis. Intel is outsourcing some of its production to TSMC to stabilize its chip production, but it doesn't expect to launch its newest 7nm chips until 2023. As a result, analysts expect Intel's revenue to slide 7% this year.
The profits, dividends, and valuations
Skyworks' earnings tumbled with its revenues in 2019 and 2020. Meanwhile, Intel maintained fairly stable earnings growth partly due to its more aggressive use of buybacks to boost its earnings per share.

Skyworks' earnings doubled year over year in the first quarter thanks to surging orders of its 5G chips. Analysts expect its earnings to grow 67% this year. That's an incredible growth rate for a stock that trades at just 16 times forward earnings.
Wall Street expects Intel's earnings to decline 13% this year as it increases its capital expenditures (capex) to resolve its manufacturing issues and address the worsening chip shortages worldwide.
Gelsinger recently warned that it could take a ""couple of years"" to resolve those shortages since it can't resolve its internal issues overnight, and top foundries like TSMC are already overloaded with orders. That's why Intel's stock, which trades at just 13 times forward earnings, still doesn't seem particularly cheap.
Skyworks isn't struggling with any chip shortages because it manufactures its chips internally instead of relying on third-party foundries.
Skyworks pays a forward dividend yield of 1.1%, which is lower than Intel's forward yield of 2.2%. However, Skyworks' other strengths arguably offset its lower yield, which simply declined as its stock rallied over the past year.
The winner: Skyworks
Intel's low valuation and yield should limit its downside potential, but it could continue to struggle with chip shortages and market share losses for the foreseeable future.
Skyworks' revenue and earnings are rising; it isn't struggling with any production bottlenecks, and its stock remains cheap relative to its growth. Therefore, I believe Skyworks will continue to outperform Intel this year and remain one of the best all-around plays on the booming semiconductor sector.

2021-03-26 00:00:00+00:00,AMD Stock Has Crashed 20%: Here's Why You Should Buy,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/amd-stock-has-crashed-20%3A-heres-why-you-should-buy-2021-03-26,,,"Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) stock hit a 52-week high in January this year, but the price for this high-flying chipmaker has pulled back over 20% since then thanks to a variety of factors such as the broader sell-off in tech stocks and rival Intel's (NASDAQ: INTC) resurgence under new leadership.
However, one look at the pace of AMD's growth and its outlook for the year tells us that the recent sell-off in the stock may not be justified. The chipmaker ended 2020 on a high and expects to deliver massive growth once again this year. More importantly, investors shouldn't worry too much about the potential impact of Intel's recent announcements on AMD's fortunes just yet, as the latter has enough going for it to ward off any threat from its bigger rival.
Let's see why.
AMD data by YCharts
AMD isn't going to fall behind Intel anytime soon
AMD chipped away substantially at Intel's dominance in PC central processing units (CPUs) and server processors last year. The chipmaker ended 2020 with a 21.7% share of the x86 processor market, which includes chips used in servers, laptops, and desktops, up from 15.1% at the end of the fourth quarter of 2019.
However, there has been chatter of Intel being on the path of a turnaround, as it had reclaimed some of its market share from AMD in the fourth quarter of 2020 on a quarter-over-quarter basis. That chatter has only become stronger as Chipzilla reportedly looks to erase AMD's technological leadership with aggressive capacity investments.
Intel recently announced a capital expenditure budget of $20 billion for 2021, a big increase over last year's $14 billion outlay, as it looks to shore up its manufacturing. The company says that the delays it faced with the 10-nanometer (nm) and 7nm chip manufacturing processes are now fixed. In fact, Intel says that its 7nm client CPUs code-named Meteor Lake are in development and will tape in the next quarter. Intel is expected to start shipping its 7nm PC chips to customers in 2023, while data center chips based on the platform are also expected in that year.
AMD has already been selling 7nm processors for quite some time now, giving it an advantage over Intel, which fumbled its transition to the competing 10nm platform and has remained stuck on the 14nm platform for a long time now. What's more, investors need not be afraid of Intel's progress on the 7nm front, as Chipzilla's timeline for the launch of those chips hasn't changed.

In fact, AMD can be expected to raise its game by the time Intel's 7nm chips hit the market by transitioning to the competing 5nm manufacturing node within the next couple of years. A smaller processing node will allow AMD to pack more transistors closer to each other, leading to improved computing performance and lower power consumption.
Therefore, AMD can remain ahead of Intel once it makes the transition to a smaller 5nm process node. Chipzilla is unlikely to regain its technology lead until the launch of its own 5nm process, the timeline for which is unknown right now. As it turns out, AMD's foundry partner Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing is reportedly working to increase the production capacity of 5nm chips. That should bode well for AMD, as it is expected to become TSMC's second-largest customer and enjoy stronger bargaining power.
Additionally, AMD can be expected to keep up the pressure on Intel in the data center space after the launch of its latest EPYC server processors. AMD claims that the latest EPYC 7003 processors based on the 7nm process are twice as fast as Intel's competing chips. Third-party tests conducted by AnandTech indicate the same.
More importantly, AMD has a solid lineup of clients using the latest EPYC server processors. They include Amazon, Cisco, Dell Technologies, Alphabet's Google, Microsoft, Lenovo, and Tencent. So it won't be surprising to see AMD log big gains in the data center market in both the short and the long run.
Buy when others are fearful
AMD stock has become cheaper thanks to the recent pullback, trading at 38 times trailing earnings. That's really cheap compared to last year's average trailing earnings multiple of 124, thanks to the sharp spike in the company's earnings and a lower share price. The good news is that AMD's bottom-line growth is here to stay thanks to a variety of catalysts, and it may not be long before the stock price follows suit.
AMD EPS Estimates for Current Fiscal Year data by YCharts
All of this makes AMD a growth stock worth buying right now, as it continues to remain in a solid position against Intel and has additional growth drivers in the bag.

INTC data by YCharts.
Does Intel belong in Silicon Valley's bargain bin, or is it time to pick up some shares at a generous discount? Let's find out.
What's wrong with Intel?
The main reason behind Intel's disappointing performance in recent months is that the company's manufacturing process upgrades aren't going well.
Historically speaking, Intel's in-house manufacturing lines have generally been ahead of rivals and third-party chip manufacturers. That advantage has allowed the company to deliver next-generation products ahead of chief rivals Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD), NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA), Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM), and Samsung. More advanced chip-making processes can result in more powerful processors and significant cost savings.
Intel's last two manufacturing upgrades have been difficult and delayed, giving the aforementioned rivals an opportunity to flip the script and fight from a stronger position in recent months. Critics see AMD stealing Intel's lunch in the data center, while Nvidia and Qualcomm make inroads in other Chipzilla strongholds such as high-speed networking solutions and automotive computing.
A new development
Intel may have turned the tide in its favor this week. The sea change won't come right away, but the chip giant most certainly sowed the seeds of something new.
Sure, anybody can call 2021 ""a transitional year"" and promise better days ahead, as Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger did on Tuesday. Raising the company's financial guidance for this fiscal year is also an easy move. Adjusted earnings can be fudged, and talk is cheap.
Intel is putting its money where Gelsinger's mouth is, though. The company is not only enjoying stronger demand than expected for its data center and PC processors, but also sinking a cool $20 billion into building more manufacturing facilities in the Arizona desert. Gelsinger and his management team are so confident in Intel's return to the top of the manufacturing technology race that the new facilities will be partly used in a foundry capacity. In other words, Intel will sell its presumably top-notch chip-making services to other companies.

Money talks
Sure, $20 billion isn't peanuts, but Intel can afford a beefy infrastructure investment. The company generated $21 billion of free cash flow in 2020 and ended the year with $18 billion in cash equivalents. This is the right time to throw additional resources into powering up Intel's technology infrastructure, even if it takes a massive capital investment to get it done.
Market makers are largely waiting for evidence that Intel can make this work, leaving its shares priced at just 12.6 times trailing earnings and 16 times free cash flows. I expect Intel to make the most of its $20 billion capital investment in Arizona-based chip factories.
When all is said and done, we'll remember today's Intel prices as a fantastic buying window. I think you should take advantage of these deeply discounted stock prices.

2021-03-26 00:00:00+00:00,ANALYSIS-Money no object as governments race to build chip arsenals,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/analysis-money-no-object-as-governments-race-to-build-chip-arsenals-2021-03-26,,,"By Douglas Busvine and Mathieu Rosemain
March 26 (Reuters) - Governments around the world are subsidizing the construction of semiconductor factories as a chip shortage hobbles the auto and electronics industries and highlights the world's singular dependence on Taiwan for vital supplies.
But beyond a consensus that something must be done to diversify supplies, divisions over strategy are emerging along with concerns that free-spending governments could spur over-building in an industry that has historically been highly cyclical.
Governments in the United States, the European Union and Japan are contemplating spending tens of billions of dollars on cutting-edge ""fabs,"" or chip fabrication plants, as unease grows that more than two-thirds of advanced computing chips are manufactured in Taiwan. Earlier this week, a top U.S. military commander told U.S. lawmakers that a Chinese takeover of the island was the military's foremost concern in the Pacific.
China has also offered a myriad of subsidies to the chip industry as it tries to reduce its dependence on Western technology, including setting up a $29 billion investment fund in 2019, helping feed arguments that Western governments need to step up.
The need for chip plants outside Asia has helped prompt Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC) 2330.TW and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd 005930.KS - the only two chip contract manufacturers capable of making the most advanced computing chips - to draw up plans for new factories in the United States and vie for what could be $30 billion or more in U.S. subsidies.
And Intel Corp INTC.O, another of the ""Big Three"" which also makes cutting edge chips, dramatically changed the playing field on Tuesday when it disclosed plans to throw open its factory doors to outside customers and build a new factory in Europe in addition to two new ones in the United States.
The net result could be a government-backed restructuring of the semiconductor industry after decades in which American and European chip firms outsourced their manufacturing to Taiwan and Korea in the name of efficiency and delivering ever cheap computing power to billions of people.
""We're in a situation now where every country is going to want to build their own fab,"" Dan Hutcheson, chief executive officer of VLSI Research, told Reuters. ""We're going from this global interconnectedness to vertical silos everywhere.""
TENSIONS AND COMPLEXITIES
In Japan, Canon Inc, Tokyo Electron Ltd and Screen Semiconductor Electron will join a government funded 42 billion yen ($385 million) program that will work with firms such as TSMC to develop advanced 2-nanometer chips. Japan wants to ensure it is able to build advanced semiconductors in the future and aims to build a test line near Tokyo with help from TSMC.
Even India, with little chip manufacturing infrastructure, hopes to build on its strengths as a design center for global chip firms and lure factories with new subsidy programs.
Lawmakers in the United States, meanwhile, are preparing to authorize $30 billion or more for chip investments via an existing Pentagon funding bill and a clutch of new measures being championed by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer.
Local officials, as well as the companies, are already scrambling for the bounty. Intel this week committed to Arizona, which has a generous state tax-abatement program as well as an established chip-making ecosystem, and analysts expect it to be a big recipient of the federal funds.
TSMC has also agreed to build a $12 billion fab in Arizona, partly at the behest of the Trump Administration. Samsung, for its part, is negotiating a second factory in Austin, Texas.
The most complex tensions are in Europe, where EU officials are clashing with national governments over whether Europe should jump into the costly race for advanced computer chip factories - a policy promoted by powerful EU internal market chief Thierry Breton - or double down on its existing strategy of specializing in niche chips. That approach is favored by the German government and many companies.
Intel in its announcement this week indicated its interest in building in Europe, and became the first of the ""Big Three"" chipmakers to back an EU goal of doubling its share of high-end chip output to 20% over the next decade.
""Europe dropped out of this race a long time ago and no longer has the necessary local know-how,"" said Helmut Gassel, head of strategy at German chipmaker Infineon IFXGn.DE, which has specialized in power chips and is the leading supplier to the car industry.
At the same time, frustration is growing about slow progress of an existing EU project on microelectronics. German officials have said 50 companies - virtually all of them pursuing the niche chip strategy that has been successful in recent decades - have applied for funds from the program.
A resolution of the split could come by summer. Peter Altmaier, Germany's economy minister, and French counterpart, Bruno Le Maire, regularly discuss along with Breton the possibility of attracting a foreign semiconductor giant to improve Europe's advanced chip-making capacity, a senior official at France’s finance ministry said.
“Each time they see each other they talk about it. The goal is to have a decision by June,” the official said, adding that the cost of such a project could be as high as $20 billion.
THE BIG GAMBLE
If the plans among world governments come to pass, the semiconductor industry could come to look much more like it did in the 1970s and 1980s, when each nation viewed chips as critical to their communications and defense.
But the risk, said VLSI's Hutcheson, is that the world builds too much chipmaking capacity, sending prices down and wiping out big swathes of the industry, similar to a crash in the 1980s that shuttered chip factories from Australia to South Africa.
""From a taxpayer perspective, it really begins to be this question of, do we really want to start another Cold War, where semiconductor fabs are the equivalent of nuclear weapons, where we're wasting all these resources?"" Hutcheson said.

Washington has increasingly viewed tech-powerhouse and democratically ruled Taiwan as a key part of its strategy to shift global supply chains away from China, especially when it comes to technology and chip companies.
Speaking at the groundbreaking ceremony for a new chip fabrication plant for Powerchip Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp 6770.TWO in central Taiwan, Brent Christensen, director of the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT), said he was there ""to restate the U.S. government's focus on supply chain security"".
""Both President Biden and President Tsai have rightly identified the semiconductor industry as a key strategic priority, not only for economic innovation, but also national security,"" he said, according to a transcript of his comments provided by his office.
Christensen pointed to last year's launch of the U.S.-Taiwan Economic Prosperity Partnership Dialogue as a way the two can ""build a coalition to counter the PRC's unfair economic and investment policies"", referring to the People's Republic of China.
""The United States and Taiwan are the globe's most natural partners in the semiconductor supply chain with an abundance of companies across the value chain, and it will continue to be an AIT priority to support this cooperation.""
Taiwan President Tsai, attending the same event, said she would guarantee that the government will fully support the development of the semiconductor industry, describing it as a ""mountain range protecting the country"".
Taiwan's central role in producing chips has shot into focus during the COVID-19 pandemic, with soaring demand for laptops, tablets and other equipment to power the work-from-home trend benefiting firms like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC) 2330.TW, TSM.N, the world's largest contract chipmaker.
Foreign governments and companies have also beseeched Taiwan to help resolve a shortage of auto chips which have idled factories around the world.

Reuters


NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Cigna shareholders will vote next month on a proposal to revamp the health insurer’s board diversity policy. In a twist on the ESG theme, it’s a conservative group that’s pleading for extra protection, in what amounts to a right-wing brickbat being lobbed at corporate America. There will be more, and in a way it’s a healthy sign.
Stockholders have launched at least 435 environmental, social or governance-minded proposals for inclusion amid this year’s annual-meeting season, according to a report led by activist group As You Sow. Most advocate for progressive causes, but a few take the view that climate change is overblown, lobbying is good, or inclusion policies harmful.
Many pitches come from the National Center for Public Policy Research, a think tank that has targeted Verizon Communications and JPMorgan among others. Others include an Intel investor who for three years has lobbied to stop the chipmaker flying the gay pride flag. As You Sow counts 22 “conservative” resolutions this year, below 2015’s high but above the 10-year average.
Many don’t even make it to ballots. Companies can ask the Securities and Exchange Commission for permission to omit proposals if they interfere with “ordinary business,” although they’re non-binding anyway. The SEC has yet to stop a company from blocking a conservative proposal in 2021. The 2019 season was the first time more reached a vote than didn’t.
Conservative ESG activists make a poor case their interests aren’t well represented in corporate America, but they do shine a light on how easy it is for companies to bounce proposals away. The ordinary-business standard is often used to spare boards awkward questions or big investors like BlackRock the need to answer them publicly. Frivolous resolutions waste resources, but so does hiring elite lawyers to nix them. If a proposal doesn’t duplicate another and negotiation fails, there’s no good reason not to give shareholders their 15 minutes.
That appears to be how things are moving. The SEC is considering lowering some thresholds for filing proposals. It could do worse than gut the ordinary-business requirement, and free up its resources for better use. The regulator has logged nearly 300 corporate requests for cover this season. A lower bar would mean more proposals make it to a vote – including conservative ones. Companies might have to embrace the spirit of open debate.

2021-03-25 00:00:00+00:00,INTC May 7th Options Begin Trading,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intc-may-7th-options-begin-trading-2021-03-25,,,"Investors in Intel Corp (Symbol: INTC) saw new options begin trading today, for the May 7th expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the INTC options chain for the new May 7th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $60.00 strike price has a current bid of $2.30. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $60.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $57.70 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of INTC, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $61.69/share today.
Because the $60.00 strike represents an approximate 3% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 100%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 3.83% return on the cash commitment, or 32.54% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Intel Corp, and highlighting in green where the $60.00 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $62.50 strike price has a current bid of $2.33. If an investor was to purchase shares of INTC stock at the current price level of $61.69/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $62.50. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 5.09% if the stock gets called away at the May 7th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if INTC shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Intel Corp, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing INTC's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $62.50 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $62.50 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 3.78% boost of extra return to the investor, or 32.06% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.
Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $61.69) to be 42%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.

NEW YORK, March 24 (Reuters) - The S&P 500 and the Dow edged higher on Wednesday on rising financial and industrial stocks as Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen expressed optimism about the recovery outlook from the coronavirus pandemic.
The remarks by the top two U.S. economic officials mirrored what they told Congress the day before, with Powell saying on Wednesday the most likely case is 2021 will be ""a very, very strong year.""
Wall Street's main indexes have flipped up and down this week as falling bond yields prompted beaten-down technology stocks to rise while energy and financial shares that have rallied this year on growing economic prospects sold off.
The ongoing rotation could be seen in an 0.8% gain in underpriced value stocks and a 0.5% drop in growth stocks.
The 10-year yield fell to 1.617%, from 1.638% on Tuesday.
Investors have focused on the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note, pondering whether there is room for long-term interest rates to run, said David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management.
""We're in a little bit of a lull here. We know that the economy is primed to begin to really accelerate in the second quarter,"" Kelly said. ""But we haven't seen that acceleration yet so that's what we're waiting for.""
Adding to upward momentum was data showing U.S. factory activity picked up in early March amid strong growth in new orders. But supply chain disruptions continued to exert cost pressures on manufacturers, keeping inflation fears in focus.
""Everybody's bullish about the prospects of a recovery right now,"" said David Yepez, lead equity analyst and portfolio manager at Exencial Wealth Advisors. ""In order for the market to bottom we need to have more fear, and I don't feel like the market has fear right now.""

As some investors start to question whether stock valuations are getting ahead of themselves, the high-growth stocks within the Nasdaq are logical choices for short-term-minded traders to think about taking profits regardless of their long-term prospects. That's a big part of why the Nasdaq was up only slightly as of 11:30 a.m. EDT today, even as the rest of the market saw gains of as much as 1%.
But not all of the Nasdaq was stuck in the doldrums. One particular area saw substantial gains, with several big-name Nasdaq stocks rising on news that pointed to positive fundamental prospects for their respective businesses. In fact, it was an announcement from one non-Nasdaq manufacturing giant that helped spur further gains for these three tech companies.

General Motors faces a supply crunch
General Motors (NYSE: GM) isn't on the Nasdaq, but it relies on companies that are Nasdaq-listed to provide key components for its vehicles. On Wednesday, GM said that it would have to make further production cuts in order to deal with a global shortage of semiconductor chips.
GM idled its factory in Lansing, Michigan, last week, and has extended the production halt at that plant. It also said it would idle its Wentzville, Missouri, assembly plant starting March 29 as well. The company hopes that it'll be able to make up the lost production with higher capacity utilization later in the year.
Other automakers also feel the pinch. Ford Motor (NYSE: F) expects to reduce output of one of its van models from a Missouri-based factory. So far, production of other Ford vehicles hasn't been affected, but it's uncertain whether a prolonged chip shortage could cause problems.
The problem largely stems from the impact the pandemic had on demand. Last year, decisions to suspend production caused automakers to reduce their use of semiconductor chips. High demand for work-from-home computers and entertainment-based consumer electronic devices diverted semiconductor supply away from the auto industry. Now that demand for vehicles is on the rise, automakers find themselves competing for limited chip supplies.
Who's winning in the chip crunch?
It's therefore no surprise to see big jumps among companies that are directly involved in semiconductor chip manufacturing. Shares of Applied Materials (NASDAQ: AMAT) saw the biggest gains today, rising more than 6%. ASML Holding (NASDAQ: ASML) followed suit with a 5% rise, and KLA (NASDAQ: KLAC) shares were up more than 4%.
It's important to understand that for the most part, these three Nasdaq stocks don't themselves make semiconductor chips. Instead, they provide the sophisticated custom equipment that chipmakers use. Products include lithography systems, various equipment to ensure quality control and detect any potential defects, and related software platforms to operate semiconductor equipment at maximum efficiency.
Semiconductor equipment makers also got a lift on news that Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) is looking to boost its manufacturing footprint in an effort to bounce back from its recent slump. A rebound would provide another potential source of demand for semiconductor equipment.
Enjoy the upcycle
Semiconductors tend to be a cyclical business, with periods of tight supply leading to dramatic boosts in production capacity that eventually create gluts. For now, though, investors are riding the boom, and shares of KLA, ASML, and Applied Materials could see further gains from here.

Wall Street has seesawed this week as a months-long rotation into economically sensitive energy and financial shares, which have gained on a growing outlook, was upended by falling bond yields that prompted beaten-down technology stocks to rise.
The 10-year yield fell to about 1.6%, a slide that had propped up highly valued technology shares that led the Nasdaq to double from year-ago lows. Value-oriented shares on Wednesday outpaced a decline in growth stocks, which include tech shares.
Investors have focused on the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note, pondering whether there is room for long-term interest rates to run, said David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management.
