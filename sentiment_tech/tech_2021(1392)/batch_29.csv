Now is as good a time as any to rebalance one’s portfolio toward a more value-oriented approach. In fact, given that recent worries about inflation are beginning to manifest, it is a great time to look toward value stocks. 
Whether this inflation is transitory, as the Federal Reserve has stated, or indeed a longer-term issue remains to be seen. I’ll leave that up to you to decide, and I’ll reserve my own judgment, but I think it’s fair to say that it’s probably not the best idea to simply sit around passively, hoping for the best. 

7 High Quality Industrial Stocks to Buy Now
Consumers are bound to take a much more pragmatic view of markets and money as we shift into the pandemic aftermath throughout the rest of 2021. That should be a boon to the value side of the stock market and should mean less love for growth stocks. 
Owl Rock Capital Corp. (NYSE:ORCC)
Intel (NASDAQ:INTC)
CVS Health Corp. (NYSE:CVS)
OneMain Holdings (NYSE:OMF)
Raytheon (NYSE:RTX)
Hasbro (NASDAQ:HAS)
General Dynamics (NYSE:GD)
Value stocks: Owl Rock Capital Corp. (ORCC)

Owl Rock Capital is a finance company that provides loans and lending services to middle market companies. The company loans these mid-sized companies money for all of the things you probably imagine a company might be seeking: growth, acquisitions, market and product expansion, refinancing and recapitalization.  
Economists consistently argue that bolstering and growing mid-market firms is a boon to the greater overall economy. So, the investment theory bull case here is that by investing in Owl Rock Capital, you’ll be investing in the true economic growth engines. 
So, what makes Owl Rock Capital a particularly compelling stock within mid-market corporate financing?
By the commonly cited value indicator of P/E ratio the company stands out. Its 6.38 P/E ratio puts it higher than 83% of peers in the credit industry. Further, being that Owl Rock Capital makes investments in companies it makes sense to be curious about its investment income. In the three months ended March 31, 2021 the company received $221.6 million in investment income, up from $204.7 million in the same period a year earlier. 
A final reason to consider purchasing ORCC stock is its dividend. The dividend yields 8.73% and should serve to intrigue investors who understand the value of such payouts in the larger scheme of things. 
Value Stocks: Intel (INTC)

I continue to believe Intel is an extremely compelling value buy in the semiconductor space. Wall Street remains afraid to step out and say that it’s a very reasonable investment at present. Analysts covering INTC stock are quite evenly distributed between those who consider it a buy, and those who consider it a hold. They’d rather recommend overpriced AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) and NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares with their P/E ratios of 31 and 80, respectively. 
Intel carries a rock-bottom P/E ratio of 12.11, meaning investors are paying a far lower premium for its earnings than from those other two. Intel has shattered earnings predictions in the last 2 quarters, and bested them in three of the last four quarters. In fourth quarter 2020, it posted $1.52 EPS, well above consensus figures of $1.11. In Q1 2021, it bested them again. Its $1.39 EPS far outpaces the $1.15 analyst consensus. 

7 Cheap Stocks to Buy Now Under $3
Another way to look at the often made comparison between AMD, NVIDIA and Intel is year-to-date performance. AMD stock is down 20% year-to-date, NVDA stock is up 5%. However, Intel is up 9%. Intel also carries a dividend which pays a 2.51% forward yield. 
Value Stocks: CVS Health (CVS) 
Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com
CVS Health is a value stock with plenty of upside. In fact, it’s been trending upward this year, so now is probably the best time to get on board in order to maximize gains. CVS stock is already up 29%, from $69.99 to $87.94, since the beginning of the year. That should at least raise the question of whether it makes sense to buy in. Analyst target prices suggest that there is still room to run up, giving it an average target price of $89.37, running to a high of $107. 
InvestorPlace’s Doug Morse looks at CVS Health as a strategically savvy company in position to rise:
“CVS has spent the past several years positioning for a bright future via the acquisition of a pharmacy benefit manager and health insurance provider. Assuming these strategies come together to materially impact healthcare outcomes and expenses, the company is positioned for future earnings growth. This company is investable right now for patient investors willing to see results in the future and collect a dividend.”
Healthcare stocks are a traditional value play, and CVS Healthcare is a particularly good one to consider during this rebound. 
OneMain Holdings (OMF)

OneMain Holdings originates and services personal loans to non-prime customers. OMF stock has appreciated roughly 9% this year, and has ample room to rise if analyst target prices are indeed correct. 
Investors should be interested in OMF stock not only because of its traditional value metrics, but simply because of its growth in the past year. Q1 2020 net income hit $32 million at OneMain Holdings. By Q1 2021 that same figure had risen to $413 million, meaning net income growth of 1,191% over the period. 
A big driving factor for any loan origination and servicing company is its ability to mitigate risk. Specifically, such companies have to minimize delinquencies and charge offs in order to maximize profits. The company has been steadily reducing the rates of charge offs and delinquency over the past several years indicating that it is more astutely originating loans.

It hit record low 1-3 month delinquency rates recently and expects charge offs to remain under 5% in 2021. 
Raytheon (RTX) 
RTX) defense company logo hanging from glass building"" width=""300"" height=""169"">

The aerospace and defense industry is one in which there are many value stocks. Raytheon is one of the well-known names in the industry, and in my opinion, one of the best to consider right now. 
The company comprises several businesses including Collins Aerospace, Pratt & Whitney, Raytheon Intelligence & Space and Raytheon Missiles & Defense. Raytheon sells across commercial, military and government making it a very broad company within the aerospace and defense vertical. 
Like OneMain Holdings above, Raytheon is a company whose stock is rising yet has room for profitability still. Year-to-date, RTX stock is up 17%. Optimistic analyst expectations indicate there could be room for further 21% growth in share price moving forward. 
Admittedly, Raytheon isn’t the best value pick in the defense industry, but it is a well-regarded pick with growth in store. Even if it doesn’t tick some of the more often used value indicators like P/E ratio in comparison to peers, it does have value merit. 
Raytheon stock carries a dividend with yield which exceeds that of almost two-thirds of defense industry peers. That’s true both currently, and in forward dividend yield terms. 
Hasbro (HAS)

Hasbro is a company responsible for many classic children’s toys and games. Its brands including Magic the Gathering, Monopoly, My Little Pony, Nerf, Play-Doh and Transformers are bound to rouse feelings of nostalgia amongst readers. While that’s all well and good, the real reason to be interested in Hasbro as a stock has less to do with nostalgia and more with value. 
Although net revenues increased a modest 1% from Q1 2020 to Q1 2021, operations became markedly stronger. The net effect is that investors are now looking at a company which is much better run. 
Operating profit, net earnings, net earnings per share, and EBITDA all increased in excess of 100% during the period. Perhaps the most all-encompassing figure which best summarizes the shift is that of net earnings. Hasbro went from a company which recorded a loss of $69.7 million in Q1 2020, to one which recorded net earnings of $116.2 million in Q1 2021. Call it an about face, a complete 180, or whatever you like. But the result is great by any name. 

7 Great Growth Stocks to Consider for Your Short List
HAS stock is relatively fairly valued right now. If investors can recognize its turnaround, there’s a lot of reason to believe that capital could flow in and share prices rise rapidly. 
General Dynamics (GD) 
Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com
General Dynamics is another player in the aerospace and defense industry. Like Raytheon, General Dynamics has been growing in 2021.
GD stock has appreciated in price by almost 25% since the new year. GD stock differs from RTX stock in that it offers more traditionally value oriented metrics including a P/E ratio. Outside of value metrics, General Dynamics stock offers enticing profitability metrics including strong operating and net margins, and a return on equity among the upper 10% of aerospace and defense firms. 
Both the fact that revenues growth and dividend growth rate should entice value seeking investors interested in the defense vertical.

2021-05-19 00:00:00+00:00,Is Apple Preparing Redesigned MacBook Pros?,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/is-apple-preparing-redesigned-macbook-pros-2021-05-19,,,"Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL) fiscal second quarter of 2021 was nothing short of phenomenal. Helped by an array of recent product launches, revenue skyrocketed 54% year over year to $89.6 billion. And those sales didn't even include the company's more recently launched overhauled iMac, updated iPad Pro, and new Apple TV.
It's fair to say that Apple's product lineup is firing on cylinders.
Yet there may be more to come from the tech giant as far as new products go. The company is rumored to be readying a redesigned MacBook Pro for a release this summer. The new product would add fuel to Apple's strong business momentum.
Apple's November 2020-launched, 13-inch M1-powered MacBook Pro. Image source: Apple.
New Macs
Citing ""people familiar with the matter,"" Bloomberg reported on Tuesday that Apple is readying 14-inch and 16-inch versions of its MacBook Pros with in-house designed processors. This would build on Apple's move last November to replace Intel chips with its own M1 in a new MacBook Air, a 13-inch MacBook Pro, and a Mac mini.
The new MacBook Pros will also reportedly feature new designs and more ports for connecting to external devices. In fact, Bloomberg's sources say the new MacBook Pros may even bring back the HDMI port and SD card slot.
Apple may also release new versions of its MacBook Air, Mac Pro, iMac, and Mac mini, the sources told Bloomberg.
A key catalyst
Such an aggressive rollout of new Macs would extend the company's impressive momentum in the key segment. Apple said in its most recent earnings call that each of the last three quarters for Mac have set records for their respective periods.
Mac sales in fiscal Q2 were particularly impressive, surging 70% year over year with strong growth in every geographic segment.
""This amazing performance was driven by the very enthusiastic customer response to our new Macs powered by the M1 chip,"" said Apple CFO Luca Maestri in the company's fiscal second-quarter earnings call.
When Apple first unveiled the M1 last November as an integral component of its new 13-inch MacBook Pro, MacBook Air, and Mac mini, the company said it was the beginning of a two-year transition for Mac as the company transitions all of its Macs to Apple silicon.
If consumer response to the first M1 Macs is any indication of how well the company's rumored new MacBook Pros will be received, 2021 will likely shape up to be an incredible year for Mac.

2021-05-19 00:00:00+00:00,"Attention, Growth Stock Investors: Price Matters",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/attention-growth-stock-investors%3A-price-matters-2021-05-19,,,"If you can find the next Amazon.com or Apple early enough, the price you pay for the stock doesn't matter all that much. The main thing is that you're right about the company's growth potential.
This is not the same as saying price doesn't matter at all. For the past few years, and especially in 2020, buying the fastest-growing stocks without any regard for price has led to spectacular returns. Software stocks, electric car stocks, e-commerce stocks, and tech stocks in general have soared.
That situation has not remained true in 2021. The priciest growth stocks have been hammered, even though nothing has really changed in the underlying growth stories.
SNOW data by YCharts
Price matters. There are long periods where it doesn't seem that's true. The lead-up to the dot-com bubble is one example. 2020 was another. But price always matters in the end.
Buying shares of good companies and holding them for a long time is a great investment strategy. It works, but only if the price you pay is reasonable relative to the company's growth prospects. A great company can be a great investment at one price and a terrible investment at another.
Great companies, awful results
Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), and Cisco Systems (NASDAQ: CSCO) were great companies back in 1999, and they're great companies today.
Microsoft is dominant in PC operating systems and productivity software, and it's now the No. 2 player in the cloud infrastructure market. Intel was the leader in PC and server chips 20 years ago, and it's still the leader today. And Cisco is the largest provider of enterprise networking hardware by a long shot.
In 1999, Microsoft's revenue jumped 29% to $19.7 billion, and its net income soared 73% to $7.8 billion. By 2020, revenue had reached $143 billion, and net income had rocketed to $44.3 billion.
In 1999, Intel's sales rose 12% to $29.4 billion, and net income was up 21% to $7.3 billion. In 2020, Intel produced revenue of $77.9 billion and net income of $20.9 billion.
In 1999, Cisco's revenue increased 43% to $12.2 billion, and net income jumped 56% to $2.1 billion. By 2020, revenue had hit $49.3 billion, and net income was $11.2 billion.

If a time traveler had laid out these numbers for you in 1999, you would have thought investing in these stocks would be a sure thing. You would have bought these stocks thinking they would easily earn you market-beating returns. You would have been dead wrong for nearly 20 years, and mostly wrong after that.
Microsoft stock only overtook its dot-com bubble high a few years ago, while Intel and Cisco stock still haven't. If you had bought each stock at the beginning of 2000, not quite the peak, here's how you did, excluding dividends:

Microsoft
321%
Intel
35%
Cisco

Only Microsoft beaten the S&P 500 index, and it took almost 20 years for that to become the case. Intel and Cisco have lost badly to the index, even though both companies have remained dominant and grown both revenue and profit considerably. Instead of listening to the time traveler, you should have just bought an index fund.
Growth, but not at any price
A list of today's top growth stocks might include cloud data software provider Snowflake (NYSE: SNOW), connected fitness company Peloton (NASDAQ: PTON), payments company Square (NYSE: SQ), electric-car phenom Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA), and e-commerce giant Shopify (NYSE: SHOP). Valuations are extreme, to say the least, even after the recent sell offs.

Data source: YCharts, Shopify Q4 report.
Of course, valuation metrics vary across industries, particularly the price-to-sales ratio. For software companies, Microsoft's dot-com peak price-to-sales ratio was less than half of what Snowflake's is today. For car companies, traditional automakers generally have a price-to-sales ratio below 1. No matter how you slice it, these stocks are expensive.
Some stocks that seemed obscenely valued during the dot-com bubble have gone on to produce fantastic returns. Amazon may be the best example. But that was not the standard result. If you were lucky enough to only invest in Amazon back then, you've have made a killing. But if you spread out your investments among a bunch of companies that seemed to have great growth prospects, the picture is more muddled.
Can these high-flying growth stocks produce market-beating returns over the next 20 years? Some of them probably will. But not every stock is the next Amazon. Even if these companies continue to grow quickly, their stock charts could end up looking like Intel's or Cisco's. When valuations are this high, you can be right about the company but very wrong about the stock.
Price matters.

2021-05-19 00:00:00+00:00,Should You Buy the Dip in AMD Stock?,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/should-you-buy-the-dip-in-amd-stock-2021-05-19,,,"Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) is doing great. The perennial runner-up in the PC and server chip markets behind Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) has been winning market share over the past few years thanks to exceptional products. AMD's Ryzen PC chips have now caught up with Intel on all performance measures, and its EPYC server chips have finally provided data center customers with a viable alternative to Intel's pricy Xeon products.
On top of winning share in its core markets, AMD provides chips for the latest PlayStation and Xbox game consoles. Strong demand for those consoles has further boosted AMD's results.
Image source: AMD.
The numbers speak for themselves. AMD's revenue soared 93% in the first quarter, and net income more than tripled. Game console chips drove a lot of that growth -- the enterprise, embedded, and semi-customer segment nearly quadrupled revenue -- but sales of PC and graphics chips climbed 46% as well.
That's how things look for AMD the company. AMD the stock, however, hasn't been doing as well, at least not lately. Shares of the chip company peaked earlier this year at nearly $100. Since then, the stock has tumbled around 25%.
AMD data by YCharts
Is it time to buy AMD stock on the dip? Or should investors stay away?
Reasons to buy AMD stock
AMD's stellar financial performance is a pretty good reason to consider buying the stock. AMD expects the good times to continue for now, calling for an 86% rise in revenue for the second quarter. For the full year, AMD sees revenue growing by about 50%. This growth will come despite the global shortage in semiconductor chips.
Missteps by rival Intel are one factor behind AMD's success. Intel is still struggling with manufacturing after years of delays related to its 10-nanometer (nm) process. AMD uses Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSMC) to build its latest Ryzen and EPYC chips, giving it access to cutting-edge manufacturing processes. AMD's chips are built on TSMC's 7nm process, while Intel is still using its ancient 14nm process for many of its chips. Intel doesn't expect to launch its first 7nm chips until 2023.
Don't count Intel out in the long run, but for now AMD holds a manufacturing advantage thanks to TSMC. That should help the company continue to rack up market share gains. AMD still ships less than 20% of PC chips and less than 8% of server chips, leaving it plenty of room for growth over the next few years as it steals further share from Intel.
Reasons to stay away
Historically, AMD has never been able to hold on to market share gains for very long. The company topped a 20% share of the desktop and laptop CPU market back in 2006, for example, but it didn't last. Years of market share losses to Intel put AMD in a dire situation before the launch of its Ryzen and EPYC processors. AMD was a mess by 2015, with revenue plunging and massive net losses the norm.
Will it be different this time? Maybe. AMD no longer manufactures its own chips, so the company doesn't have to pour cash into keeping up with Intel on the manufacturing side. But AMD is also entirely dependent on securing capacity at third-party foundries. That could limit its market share gains, especially with capacity in short supply.
With a market capitalization of around $91 billion, AMD trades for 8 times sales and nearly 60 times adjusted earnings. Until recently, AMD had never managed this kind of rich valuation. Even during the dot-com bubble and when the company was gaining market share in the mid-2000s, AMD's price-to-sales ratio never exceeded 4. For comparison, Intel currently trades at less than 3 times sales.
AMD's valuation assumes that market share gains will continue unabated, and that Intel will never be able to stage a comeback. That may turn out to be the case, but it's certainly not guaranteed. And given the high valuation, the stock could continue to slump even if the company does well. Intel stock still hasn't surpassed its dot-com bubble high even though the tech giant has been absolutely dominant for much of the past 20 years.

2021-05-19 00:00:00+00:00,Should Investors Worry About the Global Semiconductor Shortage?,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/should-investors-worry-about-the-global-semiconductor-shortage-2021-05-19,,,"The global semiconductor shortage has disrupted many industries over the past year. Technical challenges in manufacturing new chips, tight industry bottlenecks, pandemic-related disruptions, pandemic-induced demand for consumer electronics, and the secular growth of new markets -- including 5G, AI, connected cars, and the Internet of Things -- have all sparked the crisis.
Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) CEO Pat Gelsinger recently predicted the chip shortage would continue for a ""couple of years,"" while Forrester analyst Glenn O'Donnell believes it could last through 2023. Those gloomy forecasts are alarming, but should investors be concerned?
Image source: Getty Images.
Which industries will be affected?
Investors in certain companies should consider the chip shortage to be a near-term headwind. Automakers, which have already suffered severe disruptions throughout the pandemic, could struggle to recover as the chip shortage throttles their production of newer and more advanced vehicles.
During Ford's (NYSE: F) latest conference call, CEO Jim Farley admitted the ""semiconductor shortage and the impact to production will get worse before it gets better."" But on the bright side, General Motors CFO Paul Jacobson told investors that the ""short-term semiconductor headwind"" would not impact its ""long-term earnings power.""
Many consumer electronics companies, including Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Sony, and Nintendo, also face chip shortage challenges. Apple expects the shortage to throttle its Mac and iPad sales, while Sony and Nintendo expect the crisis to reduce their supplies of PS5 and Switch consoles, respectively.
Meanwhile, data center customers, 5G network operators, cryptocurrency miners, and industrial IoT companies are gobbling up more chips and exacerbating the shortage.
That pressure could generate headwinds for companies like Nokia (NYSE: NOK), which needs to expand its 5G networks to keep growing. Nokia CEO Pekka Lundmark recently said the company was ""getting prepared for the upcoming component shortage,"" and noted the issue still ""deserves constant attention.""
Those warnings seem bleak, but investors in chip-starved industries should only be worried if they plan to hold their shares for a short time. Investors who plan to hold their shares for several years shouldn't be worried as long as the underlying demand for the companies' products remains healthy.
Pay attention to the industry bottlenecks
However, the chip shortage has also highlighted the industry's overwhelming dependence on TSMC (NYSE: TSM) and Samsung, the world's most advanced contract chipmakers.
Image source: Getty Images.
TSMC remains ahead of Samsung in the ""process race"" to create smaller and more powerful chips, and it currently serves a long list of fabless chipmakers like AMD, NVIDIA, Qualcomm, and Apple.
But TSMC's existing plants can't handle the current demand for new chips, so it recently announced it would spend $100 billion to expand its operations over the next three years. Samsung is also boosting its capex, and Intel recently launched its third-party foundry business to address the chip shortage.
These moves indicate a spending war between the top foundries is imminent, so investors in TSMC, Intel, and Samsung (which isn't listed on U.S. exchanges) should expect a lot of pressure on their margins over the next few years -- even if their home countries support their businesses with fresh subsidies.
Simply put, I believe investors in these industry bottlenecks could face longer-term challenges than the companies that are actually fueling that demand.
Spot the potential winners
The global semiconductor shortage is often considered a headwind, but it can also generate tailwinds for certain companies. Semiconductor equipment makers like ASML and Applied Materials will profit from the rising capex at chip foundries since they supply the machines that manufacture the chips.
Chipmakers that manufacture their own chips, such as Skyworks Solutions and Texas Instruments, should also generate more stable growth than their fabless peers. However, these IDMs (integrated device manufacturers) could still be affected by the slower production of products that require fabless chips.
That being said, there are still a lot of companies that consider the chip shortage to either be a strong tailwind or fairly inconsequential to their near-term growth.
The key takeaways
The semiconductor shortage can be bad, neutral, or good news depending on the stocks you're holding and your investment time horizon. This isn't a black-and-white issue, and it requires a much deeper dive into the affected companies.

2021-05-18 00:00:00+00:00,2 International Tech Stocks to Buy Right Now,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/2-international-tech-stocks-to-buy-right-now-2021-05-18,,,"Many American tech stocks surged last year, as remote work and stay-at-home trends boosted demand for cloud services, software, and components for consumer electronics. The tech sector was also better insulated from the pandemic than many other sectors.
But over the past few months, that trend reversed as rising bond yields sparked a rotation from growth to value stocks. Investors also pivoted from pandemic stocks toward reopening plays, and many high-flying tech stock prices have plunged.
It's tempting to fish for bargains right now in the U.S. tech sector, but investors shouldn't overlook the international tech stocks that were also rattled by the same market rotation. Here are two growing overseas companies that deserve a closer look.
Image source: Getty Images.
1. ASML
ASML (NASDAQ: ASML) is one of the world's most important semiconductor equipment makers. The Dutch company is the world's top supplier of photolithography systems, which etch circuit patterns into silicon wafers.
The world's most advanced chip foundries, including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM), Samsung, and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), all use ASML's systems. ASML's top customer is TSMC, which can't produce its smallest 5nm and 7nm chips without using ASML's top-tier EUV (extreme ultraviolet) systems.
Therefore, ASML is just as crucial to resolving the global semiconductor shortage as TSMC. ASML doesn't face any meaningful competition in the EUV market, since it developed its technology over the past two decades, and it will launch even more powerful high-NA EUV systems within the next few years.
ASML's revenue and net income rose 18% and 37%, respectively, in 2020. It shipped its 100th EUV system in the fourth quarter and generated 43% of its revenue from those higher-margin systems for the full year. That growth continued throughout the first quarter of 2021.
For the full year, analysts expect ASML's revenue to rise 49% and 72%, respectively, as the world's top foundries all ramp up their spending to resolve the semiconductor crisis. A lot of that capex will likely be spent on ASML's systems.
ASML's stock has more than doubled over the past 12 months, but it still looks reasonably valued at 35 times forward earnings and remains a solid all-around play on the semiconductor sector.
2. Adyen
Adyen (OTC: ADYE.Y) is a Dutch fintech company that gained a lot of attention after it replaced PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL) as eBay's (NASDAQ: EBAY) payment processor. Adyen generated most of its revenue in Europe last year, but it has a growing presence in North America, Latin America, and Asia. In addition to processing online payments, Adyen helps merchants issue their own virtual payment cards and sells third-party POS (point of sale) systems.
Image source: Getty Images.
Unlike PayPal and Square (NYSE: SQ), Adyen doesn't offer any cryptocurrency transactions. It also doesn't provide native peer-to-peer payments like PayPal's Venmo or Square's Cash App. Instead, it provides tools that allow businesses to facilitate both peer-to-peer and business-to-consumer within their own apps.
In other words, Adyen is a simpler play on the growing fintech market than PayPal and Square, which have both expanded their ecosystems far beyond basic digital payments.
Adyen's revenue rose 28% to 684.2 million euros ($825.4 million) in fiscal 2020, as the shift to online sales during the pandemic offset its loss of payments at physical stores. Its earnings grew 11%, and its adjusted EBITDA increased 27% to 402.5 million euros ($485.6 million).
Analysts expect Adyen's revenue and earnings to grow another 41% and 62%, respectively, this year. That acceleration can be attributed to the reopenings of brick-and-mortar businesses, its expansion into new markets, and the final stages of eBay's three-year transition away from PayPal.
Adyen's stock isn't cheap at about 120 times forward earnings, but its long-term growth potential in a cashless world might justify that premium valuation.
The bottom line
American investors might not be familiar with European tech stocks, but companies like ASML and Adyen stand out as great overseas investments. ASML is a crucial cog in the global semiconductor market, and Adyen could still attract plenty of businesses that rely on traditional POS systems.

2021-05-14 00:00:00+00:00,EXCLUSIVE-TSMC looks to double down on U.S. chip factories as talks in Europe falter,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/exclusive-tsmc-looks-to-double-down-on-u.s.-chip-factories-as-talks-in-europe-falter-2021,,,"By Stephen Nellis
May 12 (Reuters) - Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co 2330.TW is weighing plans to pump tens of billions of dollars more into cutting-edge chip factories in the U.S. state of Arizona than it had previously disclosed, but is cool on prospects for an advanced European plant, people familiar with the matter told Reuters.
TSMC is the world's most advanced chip-maker, and its investment plans are being closely watched amid a global chip shortage and new initiatives in the U.S. and Europe to subsidize semiconductor production. TSMC announced last year that it would invest $10 billion to $12 billion to build a chip factory in Phoenix.
Reuters this month reported that previously disclosed factory could be the first of up to up to six planned plants at the site. Now, company officials are debating whether the next plant should be a more advanced facility that can make chips with so-called 3-nanometer chipmaking technology compared to the slower, less-efficient 5-nanometer technology used for the first factory.
The more advanced 3-nanometer plant could cost $23 billion to $25 billion, one person familiar with the matter told Reuters. Details of TSMC's plans for the additional factories at the Arizona site have not been previously reported.
Officials have also sketched out plans for TSMC to make next-generation 2-nanometer and smaller chips as the Phoenix campus is built out the next 10 to 15 years, the person said.
In building the plants, TSMC is likely to compete against Intel Corp INTC.O and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd 005930.KS for subsides from the U.S. government. President Joe Biden has called for $50 billion in funding to support domestic chip manufacturing, and the U.S. Senate could take action on that as early as this week.
Some government officials worry that subsidies for TSMC could help Taiwan, where the company would likely continue to conduct research and development, more than the U.S. But the U.S. subsidy plan does not exclude foreign firms.
Government and industry officials say a strong domestic chip-making sector is critical for the economy and national security. Although U.S. chip firms such as Qualcomm Inc QCOM.O and Nvidia Corp NVDA.O dominate their markets globally, most of their chips are manufactured in Asia.
Intel has also committed to two more new fabrication plants, or fabs, in Arizona, while Samsung is planning a $17 billion factory adjacent to an existing facility in Austin, Texas.
A debate over how to boost chip-making is also playing out in the European Union. Intel has shown serious interest in those efforts, with chief executive Pat Gelsinger pitching a subsidy that could amount to $9 billion for a proposed ""Eurofab"" during a trip to Brussels last month.
EU industry commissioner Thierry Breton, who has championed the Eurofab idea, also spoke with TSMC's Europe president, Maria Marced, last month. Although Breton publicly called the TSMC talk a ""good exchange,"" a second person familiar with the matter said the TSMC talks in Europe have gone ""very poorly.""
A TSMC spokeswoman said that the company has not ruled out any possibilities, but that there are no plans for a plant in Europe.
European chip and auto companies, for their part, are mostly lined up against the idea. They would prefer subsidies for the older-generation chips that are heavily used by car manufacturers and are in short supply.
Many of TSMC's most lucrative customers, such as Apple, are U.S.-based, while its European customer base is made up of mostly of automakers buying less-advanced chips. In the first quarter, clients based in Europe and the Middle East only accounted for 6% of TSMC's revenue, far outpaced by the by 67% of sales from North America and 17% from Asia Pacific.
Sources said TSMC has not ruled out building an older-generation chip plant in Europe to serve auto customers.
POACHING FROM INTEL
TSMC this year hired Benjamin Miller, a 25-year Intel veteran, as its head of human resources in Arizona. The company says that it has hired 250 engineers there and that about 100 of them, along with their families, have been sent to Tainan, Taiwan, where they will complete a 12- to 18-month training program before returning to Arizona.
TSMC declined to comment on specific details of its Arizona plans, but its Chief Executive CC Wei last month said that ""further expansion is possible"" after an initial phase. He said the company would gauge efficiency at the site and customer demand and decide on the next steps.
TSMC chairman and founder Morris Chang, warned last month of higher operating costs and a thin talent pool for the U.S. plans in a rare public speech attended by Wei and chairman Mark Liu.
""In the United States, the level of professional dedication is no match to that in Taiwan, at least for engineers,"" Chang said. He warned that ""short-term subsidy can't make up for long-term operational disadvantage.""
TSMC's first Arizona factory will be relatively small, with a projected output of 20,000 wafers - 12-inch silicon discs that can each contain thousands of chips - per month. By contrast, TSMC's ""gigafabs"" in Taiwan can produce 100,000 wafers per month.
But TSMC leaders are taking a long view, starting with mature technology and ramping up volume while gradually introducing the most advanced processes, a third person familiar with the matter said. Like the others, the person declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the matter.
“You just don’t go into Phoenix, 10,000 miles away, and start fabricating on the leading edge,” the person said.

BOSTON, May 14 (Reuters) - Hedge funds Third Point LLC and Sachem Head Capital Management, which often push for changes at corporate targets, traded in some of the same companies early this year but reached different conclusions on whether to hold or sell, regulatory filings show.
Sachem Head, run by Scott Ferguson, listed communications company Alibaba Group Holding 9988.HK as a new holding during the first quarter of 2021, according to a filing. The New York-based hedge fund bought 605,000 shares, making it one of its biggest stock holdings on March 31, 2021.
At Daniel Loeb's Third Point, portfolio managers liquidated the firm's position in Alibaba, selling 1.4 million shares. New York-based Third Point had owned Alibaba since the second quarter of 2020.
Both firms late on Friday released their 13-F filings which show what money managers held at the end of the first quarter. While the filings are backward-looking, they are closely watched for hints on potential trends and insight into what specific stocks managers liked or soured on.
Sachem Head loaded up on International Flavors and Fragrances IFF.N, buying 6.5 million shares in the company and quickly asking for board seats. Ferguson then settled with the company, giving him the option to join IFF's board later this year.
At the same time, the filing showed that he liquidated his position in DuPont DD.N where he had held 2.6 million shares since the fourth quarter of 2020. Earlier this year IFF merged with DuPont's Nutrition & Biosciences business.
At Third Point, DuPont was listed as a new position, with the firm owning 2.7 million shares.
Third Point, which earlier this year helped install a new chief executive at Intel Corp INTC.O, also bought a new stake in ride hailing company Uber Technologies Inc UBER.N. But it cut its position in Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O by 21%, a holding it had added to the portfolio during the middle of the pandemic in 2020. It cut its investment in Alphabet Inc's GOOGL.O Google by 19% but raised its holding in Microsoft Corp MSFT.O by 23%.
Sachem Head cut its holding in Synchrony Financial SYF.N by 37% and added a new stake in software platform Porch Group PRCH.O, which helps match homeowners with everything from moving companies to utility companies.

2021-05-14 00:00:00+00:00,Will Apple's 5G Modem Development Sink Skyworks Solutions?,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/will-apples-5g-modem-development-sink-skyworks-solutions-2021-05-14,,,"For Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ: SWKS), it's a good time to be an Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) parts supplier. The 5G mobility upgrade cycle is underway as consumers buy new iPhones and other devices that can connect to new 5G networks, and these next-gen connectivity semiconductors that it designs fetch a higher price than older 4G and 3G mobile chips. Apple represented just over half of Skyworks' sales in 2020, and as more 5G capable iPhones ship, Skyworks' revenue is soaring, too.
But there's always a risk that Apple might pull the rug out from its suppliers and start developing its own silicon in-house. In fact, rumors abound that Apple is working on its own 5G baseband modem. Thus, in a multi-year effort to diversify its business away from the tech giant, Skyworks recently announced it's plopping down $2.75 billion to acquire the automotive and network infrastructure segment of Silicon Labs (NASDAQ: SLAB) -- a great long-term investment in case Apple ever decides to part ways.

5G modems vs. 5G RF front-ends
It's worth noting that not all references to 5G chips are the same. The semiconductors and circuitry that make up a 5G-capable smartphone are complex and include many semiconductors from various vendors. In simple terms, a new phone has radio frequency (RF) antennas that receive a wireless signal, a modem that allows a phone's operating system to communicate with a mobile network, power amplifiers that help with signal processing, and the like.
Skyworks specializes in RF chips and amplifiers, while companies like Samsung and Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM) lead in 5G modems. Apple currently utilizes Qualcomm's modems in the iPhone, but it acquired Intel's (NASDAQ: INTC) small smartphone modem business back in 2019 for $1 billion, which sparked concern Qualcomm could lose out on that lucrative business within the next couple of years if Apple is indeed developing its own in-house chips.
For the record, if Apple does develop its own smartphone modem, it won't automatically affect Skyworks' supply relationship for the iPhone since it makes different parts for use within a 5G device. Nevertheless, Qualcomm's tenuous relationship with Apple is a dire warning for any company that derives too much business from any one customer -- especially one like Apple, which has been bringing other electronic component design development under its roof. Thus Skyworks bid for Silicon Labs' infrastructure and automotive business, which is on pace to haul in about $400 million in revenue in 2021. Based on the roughly $4.4 billion in revenue Skyworks is on track to achieve in 2021 without Silicon Labs, the acquisition will boost sales by around 10% and help diversify Skyworks away from Apple and smartphones in general in a big way.
Progress outside of smartphones is already underway
During its fiscal 2021 second-quarterearnings call Skyworks' management reported great progress on sales outside of the smartphone market. Labeled ""broad markets"" and encompassing everything from consumer electronics to internet modems to connected industrial equipment, this segment generated $385 million in revenue -- one-third of Skyworks' total revenue and up 67% year over year. Given total sales advanced 53% year over year, this implies chips outside of smartphones are quickly catching up to the smartphone connectivity bread-and-butter.
And of the two-thirds of the business that is reliant on phones, it isn't just the high-end Apple iPhone that's driving results anymore. Management has been reporting growing sales of its 5G chips to mid-tier manufacturers like Samsung, and Chinese manufacturers like Oppo, Vivo, and Xiaomi. If the most recent trajectory holds, Apple could account for less than half of Skyworks' revenue this year -- not including the acquisition of Silicon Labs.
Put another way, Apple is always a looming risk for Skyworks Solutions' connectivity chip business. But as of right now, it's Qualcomm that is set to lose out on iPhone business in the new 5G era. There's no guarantee the smartphone leader won't change its plans and cut out Skyworks, too, but for the time being, the connectivity hardware company's move into network infrastructure and automotive technology will go a long way toward making it a more resilient business long-term.

2021-05-14 00:00:00+00:00,What Kind Of Shareholders Own Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC)?,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/what-kind-of-shareholders-own-intel-corporation-nasdaq%3Aintc-2021-05-14,,,"The big shareholder groups in Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) have power over the company. Institutions will often hold stock in bigger companies, and we expect to see insiders owning a noticeable percentage of the smaller ones. Companies that have been privatized tend to have low insider ownership.
With a market capitalization of US$218b, Intel is rather large. We'd expect to see institutional investors on the register. Companies of this size are usually well known to retail investors, too. Taking a look at our data on the ownership groups (below), it seems that institutions are noticeable on the share registry. Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Intel.
NasdaqGS:INTC Ownership Breakdown May 14th 2021
What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Intel?
Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.
We can see that Intel does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Intel's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.
NasdaqGS:INTC Earnings and Revenue Growth May 14th 2021
Since institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Intel. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 8.4%. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 8.0% and 4.4% of the stock.
On studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.
While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.
Insider Ownership Of Intel
The definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.
Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.
Our information suggests that Intel Corporation insiders own under 1% of the company. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$85m of stock. Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling.
General Public Ownership
With a 34% ownership, the general public have some degree of sway over Intel. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.
Next Steps:
It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Intel better, we need to consider many other factors. Be aware that Intel is showing 3 warning signs in our investment analysis , and 1 of those is significant...

2021-05-14 00:00:00+00:00,1 Game-Changing Factor You Missed From Poly's Earnings,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/1-game-changing-factor-you-missed-from-polys-earnings-2021-05-14,,,"Communications technology specialist Polycom (NYSE: PLT), recently rebranded as Poly (and formerly known as Plantronics), crushed Wall Street's targets in Thursday's fourth-quarter earnings report. Sales rose 18% year over year to $476 million, and earnings more than quadrupled from $0.30 to $1.23 per share. Your average analyst would have settled for earnings near $0.93 per share on revenue in the vicinity of $456 million.
Yet Poly's stock fell more than 20% in after-hours trading because management's guidance for the next quarter came in below expectations.
If you're selling Poly in a guidance-based panic today, I think you missed a crucial section of this report. In fact, this game-changing information makes today's big drop look like a juicy discount. Here's what I'm talking about.

The missing piece of Poly's puzzle
In Thursday's guidance update, Poly aimed for first-quarter revenue near $420 million and adjusted earnings in the neighborhood of $0.45 per share. At first glance, those targets are atrocious, and the plunging stock price makes perfect sense. Wall Street's consensus estimates were calling for earnings of $0.82 per share and sales of approximately $441 million, after all.
But here's the bit that the bears are ignoring today:
""The global semiconductor chip shortage has impacted companies worldwide and we expect we will continue to experience ongoing tightness in our supply chain,"" according to Poly's prepared statements. ""End market demand remains strong for Video and Headsets, while Voice demand is recovering. However, the Company's ability to execute on this demand is subject to availability of certain components.""
Without the semiconductor supply shortage, Poly would have aimed for ""sequential revenue growth"" in the first quarter, meaning that there is enough demand to support next-quarter sales of at least $476 million. That's not just better than the guidance that was given, but also far ahead of the analyst consensus of $441 million.
What's next?
Nobody knows exactly how long the tight semiconductor supply situation might last, but the right answer is not ""forever.""
The chip sector's production pipeline is under tremendous pressure as the world economy recovers from the pandemic. Unpredictable order flows -- both during the coronavirus crash and the subsequent rebound -- resulted in a unique market dynamic where politicians are playing an active role in deciding which orders that leading semiconductor foundries, including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) and United Microelectronics (NYSE: UMC), should handle first.
The foundries are adding manufacturing capacity as we speak, investing billions of dollars in additional infrastructure. Semiconductor giants Samsung and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) are also helping out by investing in their own chip-building facilities and offering their manufacturing services to other companies.

Is Poly a buy today?
Some experts expect the semiconductor shortage to last for two years or more. I think that's unreasonable, given how the chip industry is rallying to tackle this challenge.
And any improvement over the worst-case scenario should be good news for Poly. It wouldn't take much of a change to make a big difference, either. A 5% boost to Poly's first-quarter revenue guidance would match the Street's expected target. A 10% increase would let the company meet the incoming demand for professional-grade videoconferencing and communication products.
Long story short, I think that Poly's guidance is incredibly conservative. In the long run, investors should remember this drop as a wide-open buying window.

DoorDash (DASH, +22.2%), on the other hand, soared after its earnings report. The food delivery service unveiled higher-than-expected revenues for its first quarter and lifted its full-year gross orders value, which helped offset a wider-than-anticipated per-share loss.

BCA Research and BofA Global Research are among analyst outfits that have recently pointed to more bullish signs. The latter points out that performance trends in actively managed funds suggest investors still haven't made a fully committed pivot into value – and thus there's still more money that could flow into bargain-priced stocks.

2021-05-13 00:00:00+00:00,See Which Of The Latest 13F Filers Holds Intel,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/see-which-of-the-latest-13f-filers-holds-intel-2021-05-13,,,"At Holdings Channel, we have reviewed the latest batch of the 45 most recent 13F filings for the 03/31/2021 reporting period, and noticed that Intel Corp (Symbol: INTC) was held by 22 of these funds. When hedge fund managers appear to be thinking alike, we find it is a good idea to take a closer look.
Before we proceed, it is important to point out that 13F filings do not tell the whole story, because these funds are only required to disclose their long positions with the SEC, but are not required to disclose their short positions. A fund making a bearish bet against a stock by shorting calls, for example, might also be long some amount of stock as they trade around their overall bearish position. This long component could show up in a 13F filing and everyone might assume the fund is bullish, but this tells only part of the story because the bearish/short side of the position is not seen.
Having given that caveat, we believe that looking at groups of 13F filings can be revealing, especially when comparing one holding period to another. Below, let's take a look at the change in INTC positions, for this latest batch of 13F filers:
FUND NEW POSITION? CHANGE IN SHARE COUNT CHANGE IN MARKET VALUE ($ IN 1000'S)

JT Stratford LLC Existing +228 +$212
Aggregate Change: +255,963 +$1,085,877
In terms of shares owned, we count 10 of the above funds having increased existing INTC positions from 12/31/2020 to 03/31/2021, with 8 having decreased their positions and 2 new positions. Worth noting is that DCF Advisers LLC, and CM Management LLC, included in this recent batch of 13F filers, exited INTC common stock as of 03/31/2021.
Looking beyond these particular funds in this one batch of most recent filers, we tallied up the INTC share count in the aggregate among all of the funds which held INTC at the 03/31/2021 reporting period (out of the 2,933 we looked at in total). We then compared that number to the sum total of INTC shares those same funds held back at the 12/31/2020 period, to see how the aggregate share count held by hedge funds has moved for INTC. We found that between these two periods, funds reduced their holdings by 33,587,530 shares in the aggregate, from 757,140,527 down to 723,552,997 for a share count decline of approximately -4.44%. The overall top three funds holding INTC on 03/31/2021 were:
» FUND SHARES OF INTC HELD

Back on May 4, Intel Corp's Director, Dion J. Weisler, invested $249,984.00 into 4,464 shares of INTC, for a cost per share of $56.00. Bargain hunters tend to pay particular attention to insider buys like this one, because presumably the only reason an insider would take their hard-earned cash and use it to buy stock of their company in the open market, is that they expect to make money. In trading on Wednesday, bargain hunters could buy shares of Intel Corp (Symbol: INTC) and achieve a cost basis 4.5% cheaper than Weisler, with shares changing hands as low as $53.49 per share. It should be noted that Weisler has collected $0.35/share in dividends since the time of their purchase, so they are currently down 3.9% on their purchase from a total return basis. Intel Corp shares are currently trading off about 2.8% on the day. The chart below shows the one year performance of INTC shares, versus its 200 day moving average:
Looking at the chart above, INTC's low point in its 52 week range is $43.61 per share, with $68.49 as the 52 week high point — that compares with a last trade of $53.47. By comparison, below is a table showing the prices at which INTC insider buying was recorded over the last six months:
PURCHASED INSIDER TITLE SHARES PRICE/SHARE VALUE
01/25/2021 Robert Holmes Swan CEO 27,244 $55.57 $1,514,004.00

The current annualized dividend paid by Intel Corp is $1.39/share, currently paid in quarterly installments, and its most recent dividend ex-date was on 05/06/2021.

WASHINGTON, May 11 (Reuters) - The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) on Tuesday said it was seeking comments on the impact the continuing global shortage of semiconductors is having on the U.S. communications sector.
The supply shortage has especially hit the U.S. auto industry hard, the FCC noted, as automakers have sharply cut production because of a lack of chips. Ford Motor Co F.N has warned the shortage could halve second-quarter production.
An industry group warned in April that broadband providers were facing chip delays, resulting in delays delivering some cable TV boxes and seeing delayed ""network switches, routers, and servers.""
The group said semiconductors shortages ""will result in hundreds of millions of dollars in impact to the broadband and cable television industry this year.""
The FCC asks ""what steps can be taken to prevent similar challenges in the future, particularly those challenges related to unanticipated, catastrophic, global events?"" and to what extent shortages are driving ""changes to the communications industry more broadly.""
""We are pursuing a proactive strategy to help build a more secure, resilient, and next-generation communications supply chain,"" said Acting FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel in a statement.
On Tuesday, some of the world's biggest chip buyers, including Apple Inc AAPL.O, Microsoft Corp MSFT.O and Alphabet Inc's GOOGL.O Google, joined top chip-makers such as Intel Corp INTC.O to create a new lobbying group to press for government chip manufacturing subsidies.
The new group asked U.S. lawmakers to provide funding to boost U.S. chips production, for which President Joe Biden has asked Congress to provide $50 billion.
Automakers want the Biden administration to secure chip supply for car factories but tech companies oppose favoring a single industry.
Tech companies such as Apple are also being hit by the chip shortage, but less severely.
The iPhone maker said last month it will lose $3 billion to $4 billion in sales in the current quarter ending in June because of the chip shortage, but that equates to just a fraction of the $72.9 billion in sales analyst expect for Apple's fiscal third quarter, according to Refinitiv revenue estimates.

In a sense, adding undervalued stocks to one’s portfolio is the ultimate contrarian move. That’s simply because what is contrary is inherently unpopular. It is often en vogue to move toward flashy, attractive growth stocks. The market bore witness to this phenomenon over the past year. Growth stocks garnered massive attention and investment evidenced by the rise of electronic vehicles (EVs) particularly, and speculative investment vehicles including special-purpose acquisition companies (SPACs).
The truth is that it can be harder to criticize growth stock investment. When growth stocks catch on, those with positions therein tend to look brilliant. Undervalued stocks on the other hand catch a lot of flak for being boring and overly conservative. So the argument here is that in choosing to seek value now is a contrarian move. 
I probably can’t convince readers that undervalued stocks are sexy, but it is important to consider stability. Value stocks weather the ups and downs better than their growth counterparts.

And in the turbulent economy that we’re all dealing with it is arguably more important than ever to find stability. That said, let’s get into a few undervalued stocks that really deserve your attention right now. If these stocks are truly undervalued, then the market is wrong and investors will look very smart indeed. 
Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) 
KeyCorp (NYSE:KEY)

Undervalued stocks: Alibaba (BABA)

I’ve been keen on Alibaba over the last few weeks in spite of, or perhaps because of the trouble it is facing. The Chinese government levied a record $2.8 billion fine against one of its own dominant e-commerce forces in Alibaba on April 9. Shares jumped up immediately following the news. That seemed odd, but the logic was that the worst was behind the company with a $2.8 billion fine, a mere drop in the bucket given the company’s revenues. Share prices have come back down and are now at the same levels they were prior to the fine being announced. 
That’s why I’d argue that now represents a moment in which Alibaba is undervalued and attractive. Investors who look at Alibaba from the perspective of a traditional value determinant like price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio may miss the point. After all, BABA stock carries a P/E ratio of 25.6, worse than about 57% of competitors. 
Make no mistake though, Alibaba share prices will rise again taking that P/E ratio higher. But it won’t matter because Alibaba is essentially one of a kind. That’s why I’d argue that its P/E ratio is somewhat irrelevant. The company’s revenues increased nearly 30% in 2020, which is far more important than temporary headwinds. 
KeyCorp (KEY)

A few weeks ago, on April 20, KeyCorp reported first-quarter earnings. Fortunately, they were strong. The company announced that net income attributable to shareholders increased to a record $591 million in the quarter. KeyCorp reported EPS of 61 cents per share. Both of these figures exceeded those from the previous quarter at $549 million net income, and a 56 cent EPS. 
That difference was strong in and of itself. However, looking back at the year-over-year growth tells an even more compelling story. In Q1 2020, KeyCorp reported a net income of $118 million and a corresponding EPS of 12 cents. 

7 Stocks to Buy Right Now With All Eyes on Crypto
While the growth is undeniably a good thing, it does represent a bit of a double-edged sword for investors currently. KEY stock now trades at a higher price than in the past few years. Its P/E ratio puts it in the middle of the pack relative to other banks. I’d ignore that along with the historically high price as well. The company’s growth will attract investment as more learn about it. Those who establish a position now will benefit from that. 
Undervalued stocks: Barrick Gold (GOLD)

To be completely honest, Barrick Gold is pretty much fairly valued. Investors who consider the company’s P/E, price-to-book (P/B), and price-to-sales (P/S) ratios — three common value metrics — will see it trades where it should. 
What then makes it “undervalued?” That is, what about this stock is the market missing, and why should it actually be trading higher? The company’s name, stock ticker, and business sector should make that obvious. GOLD stock is a play against inflation and a bet that the shiny commodity metal can serve as a buffer. 
Barrick Gold is not a household name, but it is a major force in the gold sector. It produced 4.76 billion ounces of gold in 2020. That was second only to Newmont (NYSE:NEM) and its 5.91 billion ounces. 
The company is debt free. That’s a clear financial strength for any company to possess. From a profitability perspective, Barrick Gold really deserves a bit more love. Its operating margin, net margin, return on equity, and return on assets all rank well above the 80th percentile of metals and mining peers. 
Barrick Gold also either owns, or has interest in 6 of the 13 mines in the world that have the capacity to produce 500,000 ounces of gold annually at below average operating costs. Even if investors weren’t looking at gold in light of inflationary concerns, Barrick Gold would be worth strongly considering. 
Intel (INTC)

In the summer of 2020 the main headline regarding Intel was that it had been overtaken by Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) as the world’s most valuable chipmaker. According to pundits, Intel was dead in the water and smart investors ought to pile into Nvidia or AMD (NASDAQ:AMD). 
The truth is, Nvidia remains the more valuable company from a market capitalization perspective. While Intel’s market cap sits at $223 billion, Nvidia is worth $356 billion. AMD sits at a relatively small $93 billion in market cap. 
However, the fact also remains that investors are simply willing to pay more, much more, for a dollar of Nvidia’s earnings than they are for a dollar of Intel’s earnings. Nvidia’s P/E ratio sits at 82.7, while Intel carries a very low 12.96 P/E ratio. 
Yes, Nvidia has cornered the market for desktop gaming CPUs and GPUs. However, Intel remains a force to be reckoned with and the true contrarian will disregard the negative headlines and consider its chances moving forward.

Does it really make sense to believe that Intel will stay down for the long term? No. 
Undervalued stocks: eBay (EBAY)

eBay seems to be perpetually undervalued. Investors who look back at its performance over the past few years will see that it certainly hasn’t received the love that some of its more prominent ecommerce peers have. I’m largely referring to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) here. While this isn’t perhaps fair, the two firms are intertwined as early American e-commerce success stories. 
It’s clear that investors are much more interested in AMZN stock than EBAY stock based on the traditional P/E ratio as a measure of value. Amazon sits at about 62.57, and eBay, 16.21. Thus, Amazon is about four times as attractive. Anyway, enough of the comparison because eBay is attractive in its own right.
Recently announced earnings validate that idea. Revenues increased by 42%, to $3 billion in Q1. Further, eBay saw strong growth in its customer base. Annual active buyers grew 7%, to 187 million customers. And annual active sellers grew 8%, to 20 million. eBay expects that its revenue figures in Q2 will be similar to the $3 billion it recorded in Q1. If that is indeed the case, eBay will grow on a Q2 year-over-year basis of about 9%. 
So, if eBay continues on this trajectory, it’s hard to imagine that investors won’t soon give it some love. 
Verizon (VZ)

There’s a lot for investors to like about Verizon as an underappreciated stock. From a high-level perspective the company looks reasonable as a 5G play. The markets have hyped up 5G buildout in the U.S., and indeed there will be massive windfalls to be had. Verizon is almost always a part of that conversation as a data provider consumers know as a household name. 
Earlier in the year Verizon made a heavy investment to secure its spot as a leader in the 5G revolution. The U.S. government held a spectrum auction in February in which $81 billion worth of airwave rights were sold. Verizon spent $45.5 billion in that auction, securing midrange spectrum rights. 
Part of the reason Verizon was so willing to spend so much was the T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) Sprint merger in 2020. Verizon simply understood the land grab opportunities present in the auction. 

8 Blue-Chip Stocks With Strong Earnings
This win represents a big part of the narrative behind a Verizon investment. Yet, VZ stock remains discounted. Its P/E ratio of under 13 is quite low. Roughly three-quarters of the telecommunications industry can garner more money for a dollar of their earnings. But that’s the contrarian play here. Investors who follow the narrative that Verizon is undervalued will also be purchasing a stock with a nice dividend. Verizon’s quarterly dividend carries a 4.22% yield at 63 cents. 
Undervalued stocks: Toyota (TM)
Source: josefkubes
I’d be willing to bet that most readers have a certain image of Toyota. The brand is associated with reliability and longevity. I’d argue that it’s one of the best companies in the world and that its conservative stance is attractive. However, conservative companies which build vanilla vehicles tend not to inspire the market. 
That’s fine. It’s a good part of the reason that Toyota carries P/E and P/B ratios that are lower than two-thirds of the automotive sector. 
I’d argue that Toyota ticks many of the boxes that automotive investor dollars have flooded into of late. Yet, the market hasn’t caught on to the value Toyota presents. 
Toyota announced it will have 70 electrified vehicles in its lineup by 2025. Of course EVs were all the rage in 2020, much of which has settled. But Toyota is an established name in EVs and it’s safe to say that it will be producing EVs for decades to come. By that time, a good number of 2020’s SPAC EVs will be dustbin relics. 
Another often discussed automotive technology is solid state EV batteries. While QuantumScape (NYSE:QS) garnered massive headline space recently, Toyota has quietly plodded along with its own battery development. There is good reason to believe that it will bring a solid state battery EV to market before any other manufacturer does. I believe that Toyota remains undervalued due to its staid, conservative nature. Perhaps it will pay to view it differently.

2021-05-11 00:00:00+00:00,What Would a Chinese Invasion of Taiwan Mean for Intel Stock?,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/what-would-a-chinese-invasion-of-taiwan-mean-for-intel-stock-2021-05-11,,,"In recent years, the loss of its technological lead in semiconductor chip design and manufacturing has come to define the plight of Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) stock. Chip designs from companies like Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD), Apple, and NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) are beating the longtime tech darling at its own game, and its stock performance has lagged its rivals as a result. For some, Intel's comeback looks impossible.
However, CEO Pat Gelsinger appears intent on reclaiming Intel's technological lead and eventually its industry lead, and some recent national security threats faced by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) could play a key role in that effort.
The effects on the chip industry
The threat of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan has received increasing news coverage in recent weeks following reports of rising concerns from some U.S. military officials. Chinese President Xi Jinping said in 2019 that Taiwan ""must and will be"" reunited with the People's Republic. According to Newsweek, Taiwan's intelligence agency has become more fearful lately of such a prospect as Xi faces reelection in 2022.
Image source: Getty Images.
From the perspective of chip stock investors, this threat from mainland China highlights TSMC's most significant vulnerability. AMD, Apple, NVIDIA, and others depend on TSMC for at least part of their chip production. While Intel has sometimes contracted with TSMC on some chip production recently, it has historically designed and produced all of its own semiconductor chips.
Tech Centurion reported that TSMC built a technological lead over Intel and Samsung based on achieving a higher level of transistor density. Transistor density pertains to the number of transistors that can fit on a single chip. This technological advantage likely explains why TrendForce estimates that TSMC now claims 56% of the global foundry market. If one includes Taiwanese peers United Microelectronics, PSMC, and VIS, Taiwan-based companies hold 66% of that current market share.
For TSMC, most of its production also occurs in its home country. Taiwan is home to 14 of its 17 fabs, and two of the other three are in China. TSMC has begun construction on an additional fab near Phoenix, Arizona. However, that fab will only produce 240,000 wafers per year, accounting for less than 2% of the 12.4 million wafers TSMC manufactured in 2020.
Intel's Gelsinger weighed in on the topic earlier this month in an interview with CBS's 60 Minutes. He discussed the implications of China invading Taiwan and taking over TSMC. Gelsinger pointed out that Asia makes 75% of the world's chips, while only 12% of semiconductor manufacturing occurs in the U.S. According to the Congressional Research Service, 20 fabs currently operate in the U.S., eight of which Intel owns.
To this end, Intel has lobbied the U.S. government for subsidies to bring some of this manufacturing back to the U.S. The White House has responded with a proposed $50 billion industry subsidy, which President Joe Biden will incorporate into his proposed infrastructure plan. Since Intel is the largest owner of U.S.-based fabs, it would likely receive the largest benefit from such an outlay.
Intel's financials
Judging by the behavior of Intel stock, investors seem to have focused heavily on Intel's lackluster financials. In 2020, revenue increased 8% from year-ago levels, though GAAP net income fell 1% during that period amid rising tax and interest expenses.
Still, that boost proved temporary as first-quarter 2021 revenue slipped by 1% year over year. GAAP net income for the quarter declined 41% as the company took a hit of just over $2 billion in restructuring charges.
Investors sold off Intel stock following its first-quarter news, and now, Intel stock price is down about 2% from where it stood one year ago.
INTC data by YCharts
Intel's valuation has followed these financials. It currently sells for about 13 times its earnings. This dramatically lags AMD's price-to-earnings ratio of about 34, NVIDIA's 86 earnings multiple, and even the valuation of TSMC, which sells for about 36 times its current profits.
Implications for Intel and its peers
If judging by financials only, the revenue and profit growth numbers appear to explain why Intel sells for such a low multiple. However, with Intel seeming to trade only on financials, its low valuation probably does not reflect the advantages of owning fabs within the U.S. Moreover, the multiples for AMD, NVIDIA, and TSMC do not seem to reflect the tremendous vulnerabilities that a possible Taiwan invasion poses.
Perhaps China will invade Taiwan soon, or maybe it will not seize the island nation at all. Still, this threat has become increasingly concerning. Given the lack of control investors and industry leaders have under such a circumstance, investors may need to rethink the valuations of Intel and chip stocks in general.

2021-05-11 00:00:00+00:00,What Intel Stock Investors Need to Watch in Friday’s Shareholder Meeting,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/what-intel-stock-investors-need-to-watch-in-fridays-shareholder-meeting-2021-05-11,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Intel’s (NASDAQ:INTC) May 13 annual shareholder’s meeting will be the first under new CEO Pat Gelsinger. The company — and investors — have high hopes for Gelsinger, who has a 30-year history with Intel. INTC stock is down 7.68% since he took the reins of the company on Feb. 15.

He first joined the company when he was 18, working under founders Robert Noyce and Gordon Moore, eventually becoming Intel’s first CTO. With the company struggling and INTC stock down even more over the past month, shareholders will be listening closely to what Gelsinger has to say.
Intel faces a wide range of challenges and opportunities. Here are three of the critical storylines that INTC stock investors need to be watching for on Thursday.
Will Intel Chips Regain Former Glory?
For shareholders and the public, the story of Intel over the last five years has been the company’s dramatic stumble in computer processors — the company’s core product. Intel has traditionally dominated the market for PC processors. As 2016 wound down, the company produced 82.5% of all computer processors sold. Rival Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) was a distant second and its processors were primarily used in cheap PCs.
However, 2016 also marked a turning point. AMD released its new Ryzen processors that year. As Intel began to struggle with maintaining a regular product release roadmap, AMD executed and began to relentlessly eat into Intel’s customer base. In 2020, AMD was already selling high-performance chips based on an advanced 7 nanometer (nm) process. Intel, meanwhile, was struggling to produce a consistent supply of 10nm chips. 
Last July, after announcing its own 7nm chips would be delayed until 2022, Intel’s chief engineering officer left the company. Intel’s then-CEO openly pondered the possibility of turning to other semiconductor manufacturers to make the company’s chips. The next day, INTC stock dropped 16% while AMD shares popped by close to 17%.
At this point, Intel computer processors have a 60.6% market share. AMD has continued making gains, including eating into the laptop and server markets, and now has 39.4% of the market. Premium laptops are advertising AMD processors instead of Intel chips as a major selling point.
Shareholders need to know what Intel’s plans are to wrestle the momentum away from AMD, and begin winning back the PC processor market.
Apple’s M1 Processors Pose Real Threat 
If you own INTC stock, you’re worried about Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Last November, the company announced Macs would transition from Intel processors to Apple’s own, custom M1 chips. The move will result in a small loss of revenue for Intel once complete — Apple accounts for an estimated 2% to 3% of Intel’s revenue. That’s small enough that INTC stock would shrug it off.

7 Stocks to Buy Right Now With All Eyes on Crypto
The really bad news is that Apple’s chips are good. They are holding their own against, or outperforming high-end Intel chips. And the M1 is Apple’s first whack at it. You can bet new versions will be tweaked to be measurably more powerful. This isn’t the first crack in the Intel (and AMD) computer processor hegemony. In 2019, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) put Intel on notice by releasing the new Surface Pro X. The 2-in-1 Windows 10 tablet was powered by a custom Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) processor. And yes, that announcement pushed INTC stock down.   
The big danger is that if these custom processors catch on, other PC manufacturers will follow suit. Shareholders need to know what Intel’s strategy is to prevent custom PC processors from eventually gutting its core business.
The answer is likely tied up with the first question. Apple was known to be frustrated with Intel’s processor roadmap. The company ultimately decided that developing its own chips was the path to avoiding the shortages and delays that plague Intel.
Seeking Status as Global Contract Chip Powerhouse
The world is in the midst of an unprecedented shortage of semiconductors. The lack of chips is hitting PC availability, but also impacting a huge range of products ranging from TVs to cars. Chipmakers can’t keep up with the demand.
Unlike many tech companies, Intel operates its own foundries. It is an actual chip producer. So why not take advantage of this know-how to tap into the demand? The global chipmaking industry is valued at $400 billion, making it a very lucrative target. In March, Intel announced a plan to spend $20 billion expanding its foundries. It would then enter into the custom chip business, manufacturing semiconductors for other companies.

If Intel is actually able to pivot from being so bad at it that it was looking at contracting out the job for its own chips, to building more capacity and taking on fabrication for other companies, that would be a big win for INTC stock. However, that is a huge leap to be making in the space of just two years. Shareholders need to hear more about this plan — the expenditures, the timeline, and whether any potential customers have been identified.
Thursday, May 13 is the big day. Expect Intel’s new CEO to address these big storylines and more. And keep an eye on INTC stock on Friday. Odds are we’re going to see some movement, one way or another.

2021-05-11 00:00:00+00:00,Tech giants join call for funding U.S. chip production,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/tech-giants-join-call-for-funding-u.s.-chip-production-2021-05-11,,,"By Stephen Nellis
May 11 (Reuters) - Some of the world's biggest chip buyers, including Apple Inc AAPL.O, Microsoft Corp MSFT.O and Alphabet Inc's GOOGL.O Google, are joining top chip-makers such as Intel Corp INTC.O to create a new lobbying group to press for government chip manufacturing subsidies.
The newly formed Semiconductors in America Coalition, which also includes Amazon.com's AMZN.O Amazon Web Services, said Tuesday it has asked U.S. lawmakers to provide funding for the CHIPS for America Act, for which President Joe Biden has asked Congress to provide $50 billion.
""Robust funding of the CHIPS Act would help America build the additional capacity necessary to have more resilient supply chains to ensure critical technologies will be there when we need them,"" the group said in a letter to Democratic and Republican leaders in both houses of the U.S. Congress.
A global chip shortage has hit automakers hard, with Ford Motor Co F.N saying it could halve second-quarter production.
Automotive industry groups have pressed the Biden administration to secure chip supply for car factories. But Reuters last week reported administration officials were reluctant to use a national security law to redirect computer chips to automakers because doing so could hurt other industries.
The new coalition includes some of those other chip-consuming industries, with members such as AT&T T.N, Cisco Systems CSCO.O, General Electric GE.N, Hewlett Packard Enterprise HPE.N and Verizon Communications Inc VZ.N. It cautioned against government actions to favor a single industry such as automakers.
""Government should refrain from intervening as industry works to correct the current supply-demand imbalance causing the shortage,"" the group said.
Tech companies such as Apple are also being hit by the chip shortage, but far less severely than automakers.
The iPhone maker said last month it will lose $3 billion to $4 billion in sales in the current quarter ending in June because of the chip shortage, but that equates to just a few percent of the $72.9 billion in sales analyst expect for Apple's fiscal third quarter, according to Refinitiv revenue estimates.
