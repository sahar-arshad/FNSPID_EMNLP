Adds details
TAIPEI, Oct 14 (Reuters) - Taiwan chip giant TSMC 2330.TW posted a 13.8% jump in third quarter profit on Thursday on the back of booming demand for semiconductors to power smartphones and other gadgets during the COVID-19 pandemic amid a supply crunch.
July-September net profit for TSMC, the world's largest contract chipmaker and a key supplier to Apple Inc AAPL.O, came in at T$156.3 billion ($5.56 billion), well ahead of the T$149 billion average of 22 analyst estimates compiled by Refinitiv.
Advanced chips made by TSMC, formally known as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co TSM.N, are used in everything from high-end smartphones like Apple's newly unveiled 5G iPhone 13, to artificial intelligence, cars and a wide variety of lower-end consumer goods.
TSMC and Taiwan in general have also become central in efforts to resolve a pandemic-induced global chip shortage that has forced automakers to cut production, and hurt manufacturers of smartphones, laptops and even consumer appliances.
TSMC's revenue for the quarter climbed 22.6% to $14.88 billion, in line with the company's prior estimated range of $14.6 billion to $14.9 billion.
Shares of TSMC have risen about 8.5% so far this year, giving it a market value of $526.3 billion, more than double that of competitor and client Intel Corp INTC.O.

SAN FRANCISCO, Oct 13 (Reuters) - Hyundai Motor's 005380.KS global operating officer said on Wednesday the automaker wants to develop its own chips to reduce reliance on chipmakers.
A global shortage of semiconductors, triggered partly by surging demand for laptops and other electronic products during the pandemic, has shuttered some auto production lines globally this year.
Hyundai temporarily suspended some factories, but the company’s global chief operating officer Jose Munoz told reporters the worst has passed for the industry chip shortage, adding it had the ""toughest months"" in August and September.
""The (chip) industry is reacting very, very fast,"" he said, saying Intel INTC.O is investing a lot of money to expand capacity.
""But also in our case, we want to be able to develop our own chips within the group, so we are a little bit less dependent in a potential situation like this,"" he said.
""This takes a lot of investment and time, but this is something we're working on.""
He said the company's parts affiliate Hyundai Mobis 012330.KS would play a key role in the in-house development plan.
He also said Hyundai Motor aims to deliver vehicles at the level of its original business plan in the fourth quarter, and offset some of its production losses next year.

2021-10-13 00:00:00+00:00,Ex-Intel executives' startup aims to tackle spiraling costs of AI,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/ex-intel-executives-startup-aims-to-tackle-spiraling-costs-of-ai-2021-10-13,,,"By Stephen Nellis
Oct 13 (Reuters) - After Intel Corp INTC.O bought Naveen Rao and Hanlin Tang's startup in 2016, their job was to help the chip giant make money off artificial intelligence, which requires vast computing power and had become lucrative for the chip industry.
But after leaving Intel last year, the pair on Wednesday revealed a startup called MosaicML. It aims to help businesses and researchers carry out artificial intelligence more efficiently - in other words, by using less computing power and fewer chips. It has raised $37 million in funding from DCVC, Lux Capital, Future Ventures, Playground Global and other venture investors.
MosaicML's founders said that artificial intelligence models, which must be ""trained"" using huge troves of data, have jumped in complexity since 2018. Training a model can now require million of dollars worth of computing, putting it out of reach for all but large companies.
""Businesses can't do this anymore - they can't have access to the latest methods,"" Rao told Reuters in an interview. ""It's not good for our field.""
Rao and Tang linked up with Professor Michael Carbin and Jonathan Frankle, a doctoral candidate in his research group, respectively, at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who had published work on how to make machine learning more efficient. What the group found is there is no single technology for reducing AI computing costs, but instead a mosaic - hence the company's name - of different approaches emerging among researchers.
MosaicML puts those existing ideas into a more polished form that is directly usable by businesses. It then also offers paid services, such as tools for estimating the tradeoffs between the speed, cost and accuracy of using different kinds of computing hardware for training an AI model.
David Kanter, executive director of MLCommons, an AI industry group that is not involved with MosaicML, said that predicting and controlling computing costs have become a key issue for businesses looking to tap into the latest advances in AI technology, making work like MosaicML's important to watch.
""Removing hassle, making it faster, making it more affordable, all these things are potentially beneficial to the industry,"" Kanter said.

2021-10-13 00:00:00+00:00,3 Top 5G Stocks to Buy for the Long Haul,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-top-5g-stocks-to-buy-for-the-long-haul-2021-10-13,,,"5G has been a buzzword for years now, but investors haven't really seen the full fruits of this powerful technology transition yet. The first 5G iPhone was only introduced last year, and leading telecom companies are still building out their 5G networks, which likely won't be completed for years. A study from Juniper Research predicts 5G phones won't even gain a majority market share of the smartphone market until 2025.
That still leaves years of growth ahead for leading 5G-related companies. Given the strong tailwinds for the overall industry, picking competitively advantaged leaders seems like a no-brainer for long-term investors.

Apple
Sometimes, good investments are obvious and right in front of you. While the Wall Street community tends to obsess of the next quarter's iPhone sales, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) is a beloved brand, which should enable it to keep up growth through the 5G era. Last quarter, not only did Apple see customers upgrading to 5G phones at double-digit rates, but Apple also saw ""switchers"" from Android to iPhone also grow double-digits. And when someone switches to the powerful Apple ecosystem, they tend to stick around.
It's not only the iPhone that should benefit from 5G, but also new advanced services Apple is likely to develop for its 1.65 billion-device user base. After all, many were skeptical Apple could develop a viable video streaming service with large and entrenched competitors. Yet it appears Apple has at least some early success with critics, as Apple TV+'s Ted Lasso swept the recent Emmy awards.
On its July conference call, Apple's management highlighted that paid subscriptions had increased by 150 million over the past year to 700 million. One can easily imagine that increasing as 5G enables new services across healthcare, AR/VR, video games, and other must-haves for Apple's loyal users.
Finally, Apple has also been developing its own in-house hardware for its Macs and iPads, with its M1 chip. And while Apple has developed its own processor for the iPhone, it also has plans to develop its own mobile modem in the years ahead, having bought Intel's modem division back in 2019. More chip-making capabilities would further differentiate Apple's hardware against rivals to an even greater degree, setting it up for continued dominance in the 5G era.
ASML Holdings
5G capabilities will require leading-edge semiconductor capabilities, and all leading-edge semiconductor manufacturers depend upon machines made by ASML Holdings (NASDAQ: ASML), the only company with extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography technology.
As the distance between semiconductor transistors has progressed below the seven nanometer mark in the past few years, EUV lithography has become essential. Of course, that distance will only continue to shrink in the years ahead, so ASML is set up for years and years of profitable growth.
ASML also just held its investor day, where it gave 2025 revenue guidance between 24 billion and 30 billion euros, up from its prior 2018 guidance of 15 billion to 24 billion euros. The increase has been driven by accelerated demand for semiconductors brought on by the pandemic, as well as developed nations all wanting EUV production capacity on their own shores.
Image source: ASML.
Of course, there's a good chance ASML beats that guidance, since it raised the 2025 guidance by so much in just three years' time. And management doesn't see growth slowing in 2025, but rather continuing at high rates through 2030, when the semiconductor market is projected exceed $1 trillion. In fact, ASML sees revenue growth growing at an 11% average rate through 2030. While 11% may not shoot the lights out in any one year, a compounded 11% growth rate over 10 years is extremely good and difficult for most companies to achieve, especially those already as large as ASML. Throw in annual share repurchases and a rising dividend, and ASML's stock looks like an unstoppable compounder for the next decade.
Having already had a big run in 2021, shares of ASML have sold off recently with other growth stocks amid fears of rising interest rates. ASML shares never get particularly cheap, so now may be a good time to scoop up this 5G leader for the long term.
Kulicke & Soffa
While 5G will require leading-edge semiconductors in order to work, those chips will also need to be packaged in new and innovative ways with accelerators and memory. That's where Kulicke & Soffa (NASDAQ: KLIC) comes in, a leader in wire bonding machines that enable semiconductor advanced packaging.
Kulicke & Soffa will not only benefit from the shortage of semiconductor production capacity this year and next, but 5G and other advanced applications will also require increased packaging intensity, further expanding K&S's market.
Furthermore, Kulicke & Soffa has been developing machines for micro and mini LED displays. Micro/miniLED is a new technology only available in the most advanced premium displays today, but it has the potential to penetrate computers, wearables, and even smartphones by 2024. Based on these three bullish factors, management expects its total addressable market to grow from $3.5 billion in 2021 to $5.5 billion by 2024.
Like ASML, Kulicke & Soffa's stock also sold off hard recently after an impressive rally this year. After the recent dip, the stock trades around $53 per share. That seems incredibly cheap, given that management expects more than $6 in earnings per share in 2024. Kulicke & Soffa also has a lot of extra cash on its balance sheet, with over $600 million in cash and no debt. That is over $9 per share, so backing that out, Kulicke & Soffa only trades around seven times that 2024 figure.
There's also reason to think that 2024 guidance is incredibly conservative. After all, last quarter, K&S made $1.87 in adjusted (non-GAAP) earnings per share, which annualizes to $7.48. Yes, sales are booming thanks to the current shortage, so that might cool off a bit. However, management has also been very conservative with this year's guidance too. Should K&S step up share repurchases, it could retire a good chunk of its stock at these bargain-basement levels.
For value investors having trouble finding cheap stocks in the 5G tech sector, Kulicke & Soffa should be at the top of your list.

2021-10-13 00:00:00+00:00,Internet Infrastructure Stocks To Watch,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/internet-infrastructure-stocks-to-watch-2021-10-13,,,"Our indicative Theme of Internet Infrastructure Stocks – which includes a diverse set of companies that sell hardware and software that underpin the Internet – has returned about 17% year-to-date, roughly in line with the S&P 500. The theme has also returned about 60% year-to-date, compared to the S&P 500 which returned about 52% over the same period. That said, there are a couple of factors that could help the stocks in the near-to-medium term. The U.S. infrastructure bill has earmarked about $65 billion to bring broadband into unserved and underserved areas of the U.S. and this could spur demand for internet infrastructure players. The broader shift to hybrid and distributed workplaces following Covid-19 could also drive demand for better connectivity and broadband, helping the stocks in our theme.
Within our theme, Nvidia stock (NASDAQ:NVDA) has been the strongest performer, rising by about almost 60% year-to-date, driven by robust demand for its GPUs from data centers and gaming consoles and its recent stock split. On the other side, Lumentum Holdings (NASDAQ:LITE), a company best known for its optical networking products, has been the worst performer, with its stock declining by about 11% year-to-date.
[6/23/2021] Three Reasons Why Internet Infrastructure Stocks Are A Buy
Our indicative Theme of Internet Infrastructure Stocks – which includes a diverse set of companies that sell hardware and software that underpin the Internet – has returned about 14% year-to-date, marginally outperforming the Nasdaq-100 which is up by about 12% over the same period. The theme is also up by a relatively solid 47% since the end of 2019. We think that this theme could outperform going forward for several reasons. Firstly, Covid-19 and the remote working trend are likely to accelerate the pace of digitization of businesses and the economy, translating into higher demand for the products and services provided by the companies in our theme. Moreover, the Biden Administration’s plan to spend $65 billion to bring broadband into unserved and underserved areas of the U.S. is also likely to help. Separately, most of the stocks in the theme are value bets, which could benefit as investors rotate out of highly valued growth names as interest rates rise in the coming years.
Within our theme, Nvidia stock (NASDAQ:NVDA) has been the strongest performer, rising by about 45% year-to-date, driven by robust demand for its GPUs from data centers and gaming consoles and its recent stock split announcement. On the other side, Lumentum Holdings (NASDAQ:LITE), a company best known for its optical networking products, has been the worst performer, with its stock declining by about 15% year-to-date due to weaker than expected Q3 FY’21 earnings.
[3/18/2021] How Are Internet Infrastructure Stocks Faring?
Our indicative Theme of Internet Infrastructure Stocks – which includes a diverse set of companies that sell hardware and software that underpins the Internet and data centers – has gained about 11% year-to-date, outperforming the S&P 500 which is up by 5.5%. The theme is also up by a solid 43% since the end of 2019, compared to a return of about 23% for the S&P 500. These stocks should stand to gain in the medium to long-term, driven by the increasing digitization of the economy through and post the Covid-19 pandemic.
Within our theme, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) has been the strongest performer, rising by about 29% year-to-date, driven by robust semiconductor demand, some changes at the top management levels, and stronger than expected quarterly earnings. Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) has also done well, rising by 22% year-to-date, as demand for DRAM is likely to pick up driven by stronger demand from cloud data centers and personal computers. Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) stock is also up 10% year-to-date, as corporate IT spending is expected to rebound as the Covid-19 pandemic wanes. However, NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) has been a relative underperformer remaining largely flat year-to-date, due to its relatively rich valuation and its big rally last year.
Other related sectors that stand to benefit from the digital shift include companies that provide cybersecurity software and wireless equipment and services. Check out our themes on Cyber Security Stocks and 5G Stocks for more details.
[12/8/2020] Internet Infrastructure Stocks
Our indicative Theme of Internet Infrastructure Stocks – which includes a diverse set of companies that sell hardware and software that underpins the Internet and data centers – has gained about 32% year-to-date, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 which is up by about 15% year-to-date. (as of 12/7/2020). We see these stocks as a key play on the increasing digitization of the economy through and post Covid-19. Below is a bit more about how these stocks have fared over the last month.
While Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) remains the biggest winner in our theme, up 131% year-to-date, its performance has been mixed over the last month or so as news related to the Covid-19 vaccines saw investors shift focus to lower growth and value stocks. Micron Technology (NASDAQ: MU)  stock, on the other hand, has rallied by 30% over the last month as demand for its DRAM chips is expected to rise significantly next year particularly from cloud data centers, smartphones, and gaming consoles. Although Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) has been the worst performer in the theme year-to-date due to delays in its next-gen process technology and mounting competition from AMD and Apple’s well-reviewed proprietary chip,  it has done reasonably well over the past month, rising by about 10%. Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) stock has also lagged this year, down by about -7% year-to-date. However, the stock rallied by about 16% over the last month, driven partly by stronger than expected Q1 FY’21 results, with the company continuing to transition to a more software-centric model.

Our indicative Theme of Internet Infrastructure Stocks which includes a diverse set of companies that sell semiconductor products, networking equipment, and related products that underpin the Internet – has gained about 19% year-to-date, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 which is up by about 5% year-to-date. (as of 10/28/2020). These stocks should benefit from the growing requirement for connectivity and computing power, as the Covid-19 pandemic accelerates the shift online. While Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) remains the strongest performer, up 130% year-to-date, Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) and Cisco (NASDAQ: CSCO) have underperformed significantly, and are down by almost 20%.
Nvidia (NVDA) is a semiconductor company best known for its graphic processing units (GPUs) that are increasingly used in servers for machine learning and artificial intelligence. In September, the company said that it would acquire U.K based chip designer ARM which specializes in power-efficient central processing units (CPU). The stock is up 131% year-to-date.
Lumentum Holdings Inc. (LITE) manufactures optical networking products such as tunable transponders, transceivers, and transmitter modules,  lasers, receivers, and modulators. The company also provides components such as 3D sensors that are used on mobile phones, including the iPhone. The stock is up 6% year-to-date.
Micron Technology (MU) is a memory manufacturer that sells DRAM and NAND memory. Although the stock is down -1.7% year-to-date, due to some weakness in memory prices, it’s possible that pricing for DRAM could pick up in the coming quarters, driven by the launch of new video game consoles and higher demand from the server space.
Cisco (CSCO) is a networking major that sells networking software, and products such as switches and routers.  While the stock has underperformed, declining by about -19% year-to-date, it could pick up as data centers start upgrading to the next generation 400G network technology, which improves data capacity significantly.
Intel (INTC) one of the largest producers of CPUs for servers and PCs, has seen its stock drop by about -19% this year, due to delays with its next-generation 7-nm chips and strong competition from rivals such as AMD – which has been broadening its portfolio of CPUs and GPUs targeted at data centers, and Nvidia, which could play a larger role in the CPU space via its ARM deal.

*Stock Advisor returns as of September 17, 2021
Brian Withers: What is one wide moat stock that you like? Describe the moat and how it helps the company be successful. Nick, I love this. We'll have you on first. [laughs]
Nicholas Rossolillo: Do you want to start with the inflation thing?
Withers: Yes. I wanted to hear your, I guess, discussion on Elon Musk's quote on [laughs] moats.
Rossolillo: Sure. We can talk inflation later, I guess. Who knows what's going to happen next?
Withers: I assume that we don't know any better than anybody else. [laughs]
Rossolillo: Good assumption.
Withers: There you go.
Rossolillo: [laughs] Wide moats, I always think of this Elon Musk quote during a quarterlyearnings call I think it was back in 2018. He said 'moats are lame.' [laughs] I just thought it was really insightful especially with the day and age where technology is disrupting and changing the economy at such a rapid pace. Basically, what you're saying is like a good offense is your best defense. Sitting on your castle and surrounding yourself with moat and just waiting for the invading army to come is [laughs] not the best business strategy at this particular stage.
Withers: It sounds like one of the Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) founders that said only the paranoid survive, [laughs] I can see that description fitting Elon Musk very well.
Rossolillo: Yeah, and the paranoid go on the offense. Companies with wide moats are, I like NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) and not because I think it has this massive moat but because it is always on the offensive. Obviously they have the whole GPU business that started in video games and has just steadily expanded, but I really like what they've been doing in recent years with software. I think it's this under the radar segment of business that they've been steadily building up, based on the semiconductor bread and butter that they've developed. The software is just really picking up speed.
I think some of the components of business where it's most obvious is like the GeForce now, business subscription, Cloud subscription to the gaming service, even the automotive segment where NVIDIA gets talked about a lot. They're partnering with automakers to get self-driving cars, develop into market quicker. But behind the scenes, it's a hardware business, but it's behind the scene of software business too. There's a lot of software, algorithm training that has to happen inside data centers to get these vehicles, these platforms up and running. They're doing a lot with AI as well. Have launched there own AI services that organizations can tap into to help accelerate their transition to some of these next-gen software services, so I like NVIDIA.
Toby Bordelon: I went the same direction as you, Nick, in terms of the type of company, I'm going with a tech company too. I think I like a lot of them, there's not a lot of them, but several of the big tech giants. You talked about that trillion dollar plus club out there. I think when you see a company that's got a trillion dollar market cap, you got to ask yourself why and why are they in such an elite group? There's probably a moat there, right? Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), I think is a good example of this.
You think, what does the moat of these companies? Microsoft, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL). You can do Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) too, it's a good one. Microsoft, a lot of their revenue comes from the Azure. If you're thinking about an inflationary environment, we're talking Cloud computing, clients aren't going to stop using their services because of a little bit of inflation. It's so fundamental to their business. They have to have it. They're just going to keep going. There's a little bit of pricing power, Microsoft is going to be able to pass on some cost increases their customers.
Again, you can make a similar argument for Amazon, at least with the AWS part. What is the specific moat? It's hard to say. Is it brand name, is it just they're so big? I think a lot of it is cash, cash flow and cash on hand. When they see a little threat, think about Microsoft with respect to Slack. They can say that is some great innovation, that's some good ideas, what Slack is doing, let's integrate all that into Teams. If it costs us $10 billion to do it, man, who cares? It's probably going to be good for our customers. We couldn't even get to them for free because we don't care. The point is not to make money, it's to increase the stickiness of the relationship.
You're talking about a moat involved in, the cash that allows you to compete, and then the variety of services you're offering that create that sticky relationship and make a customer think, well, I could go somewhere else and get this and pay for it, or I can just use your free or included offering and see how you evolve that over time that might work. That allows them to be these trillion-dollar companies and to continue to grow. I really like them, but again, I think any of the big tech companies could fall into that category as really awesome in an inflationary environment.

2021-10-12 00:00:00+00:00,Sum Up The Parts: EQWL Could Be Worth $92,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/sum-up-the-parts%3A-eqwl-could-be-worth-%2492-2021-10-12,,,"Looking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at ETF Channel, we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. For the Invesco S&P 100 Equal Weight ETF (Symbol: EQWL), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $91.97 per unit.
With EQWL trading at a recent price near $81.45 per unit, that means that analysts see 12.92% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of EQWL's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are Intel Corp (Symbol: INTC), Chevron Corporation (Symbol: CVX), and Broadcom Inc (Symbol: AVGO). Although INTC has traded at a recent price of $53.44/share, the average analyst target is 15.51% higher at $61.73/share. Similarly, CVX has 14.43% upside from the recent share price of $107.13 if the average analyst target price of $122.59/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting AVGO to reach a target price of $557.42/share, which is 13.22% above the recent price of $492.34. Below is a twelve month price history chart comparing the stock performance of INTC, CVX, and AVGO:
Below is a summary table of the current analyst target prices discussed above:
NAME SYMBOL RECENT PRICE AVG. ANALYST 12-MO. TARGET % UPSIDE TO TARGET
Invesco S&P 100 Equal Weight ETF EQWL $81.45 $91.97 12.92%
Intel Corp INTC $53.44 $61.73 15.51%
Chevron Corporation CVX $107.13 $122.59 14.43%
Broadcom Inc AVGO $492.34 $557.42 13.22%
Are analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past. These are questions that require further investor research.

2021-10-12 00:00:00+00:00,3 Dividend-Paying Tech Stocks to Buy Right Now,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-dividend-paying-tech-stocks-to-buy-right-now-2021-10-12,,,"Tech stocks often fall into two categories: those that are owned for growth, and those that are owned for stability and income.
The former usually outperform the latter during bull markets, but dividend-paying blue-chip tech stocks often shine when the market declines. Therefore, adding a few dividend-paying tech stocks to your portfolio might soften the blow of a market crash.
Let's take a look at three stocks that fit the bill: Texas Instruments (NASDAQ: TXN), United Microelectronics (NYSE: UMC), and Corning (NYSE: GLW).
1. Texas Instruments
Texas Instruments sells analog and embedded chips to a wide range of industries. Its chips are less capital-intensive to manufacture than higher-end chips, so they generate plenty of free cash flow (FCF).
Image source: Getty Images.
TI's FCF has increased by an average of 12% annually from 2004 to 2020, and it's repeatedly committed to returning all of that cash to shareholders via buybacks and dividends. It reduced its share count by 46% between 2004 and 2020, and it's raised its dividend annually over the past 17 years.
TI spent 56% of its FCF on its dividends over the past 12 months, and it currently pays a forward yield of 2.4%. Investors who stuck with TI over the past 10 years and reinvested its dividends are now sitting on a total return of 745%, which crushes the S&P 500's total return of 350%.
TI's momentum will likely continue as it sells more chips for new vehicles, industrial machines, mobile devices, and networking infrastructure. TI is also fairly well insulated from the global chip shortage since it manufactures its own chips instead of outsourcing its production to third-party foundries.
Analysts expect TI's revenue and earnings to rise 24% and 36%, respectively, this year against easy comparisons to the pandemic. Its growth will likely decelerate next year, but its stock is still reasonably valued at 24 times forward earnings -- and it offers a solid balance of diversification, value, and income for long-term investors.
2. United Microelectronics
I recently highlighted United Microelectronics, TSMC's (NYSE: TSM) much smaller competitor in Taiwan's contract chipmaking market, as an undervalued growth stock. Unlike TSMC, UMC doesn't manufacture the world's smallest chips. Instead, UMC only accepts orders for older and larger chips, which are less capital-intensive to produce.
Three years ago, UMC stopped pursuing TSMC and Samsung into advanced chips beyond the 14nm node, and pivoted toward the lower-end automotive and Internet of Things markets instead. Analysts expect UMC's revenue to rise 18% this year, and for its net income to more than double as it focuses on expanding its margins and generating stronger FCF growth.
UMC's dividend yield fluctuates from year to year, but it aims to pay out more than 50% of its earnings as dividends. It paid out a trailing dividend yield of 2.6% over the past 12 months, and CFO Qi Dong Liu predicted the company would ""distribute a stable and hopefully increasing cash dividend along with our improved EPS"" during last quarter's conference call.
UMC's high dividend yield, along with low forward P/E ratio of 13, indicate its stock still has plenty of room to run after nearly doubling over the past 12 months. Investors who are looking for a cheaper alternative to TSMC -- which plans to significantly boost its capital expenditures over the next three years to maintain its lead against Intel (NASDAQ: INTC)-- should take a much closer look at UMC.
3. Corning
Corning manufactures the chemically hardened Gorilla Glass for consumer electronics, glass substrates for display panels, optical communications hardware, lab equipment for life science companies, and particulate filters for cars. The company's revenue and earnings both dipped last year as the pandemic disrupted its core end markets and their supply chains.
But this year, Corning's growth stabilized -- led by robust demand for Gorilla Glass on new 5G devices, strong sales of glass substrates for new TVs and monitors as more people stayed at home, optical upgrades at network operators, new life science contracts related to the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, and sales of more particulate filters for environmentally-friendly vehicles.
As a result, analysts expect Corning's revenue and earnings to rise 23% and 53%, respectively, this year, before cooling off next year. Its stock trades at just 15 times forward earnings and it pays a forward yield of 2.6%. It spent just 49% of its FCF on its dividends over the past 12 months, and it's raised its payout every year since its first payment over a decade ago.
Corning isn't an exciting growth stock, but it provides a balanced way to invest in the long-term expansion of the mobile, optical, life science, and auto markets. Corning's end markets are cyclical, but its current growth cycle hasn't peaked yet -- and its dividends should continue rising for the foreseeable future.

These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.

Tech stocks are in a slump. Sure, the damage isn’t that bad on the headline Nasdaq 100 Index, which has fallen as much as 8% from the recent highs. However, under the surface, speculative growth stocks are getting killed. Cathie Wood’s Ark Innovation ETF (NYSEARCA:ARKK), for example, is down 32% from its peak. Amid such selling, tech investors are looking for safety. And few companies meet that standard better than Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) stock.

Intel has underperformed the tech stock indexes over the past few years. It’s perceived, with some good reason, as a slow-moving and fairly stodgy firm that has been outpaced by more nimble competitors. However, people writing it off prematurely will be surprised. Intel is still a dominant firm throwing off immense profits and which will shelter investors whenever markets turn sour.
The Semiconductor Boom
The price of tech stocks has soared over the past few years. That’s doubly true for semiconductor firms in particular. The industry has enjoyed an incredible ramp up in demand. This has come from a variety of factors, such as cryptocurrency mining, increasing usage in smart connected devices such as home appliances, and a lack of sufficient investment in the semi sector in recent years.
7 Great Travel Stocks to Buy for Q4
Now throw in the pandemic and its ensuing supply chain mayhem, and semiconductor firms are having historically good fortune. Unfortunately, their share prices already account for all that… and then some.
INTC Stock: A Cheap Option Amid Overheated Sector
Consider AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). Since 2015, AMD has soared from trading at less than 1x sales to 9x sales now. Nvidia, meanwhile, surged from 5x revenues to 23x revenues over the same period. Maybe these companies have gotten so much better over that time span that they are worth five or ten times as much per dollar of revenues as they used to be. In all likelihood, however, they have not.
On an earnings basis, NVDA stock is now going for 73x trailing revenues. That’s amazing. We’re near the top of the semiconductor demand cycle. As if that weren’t enough, cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD) are set to switch to proof-of-stake mining algorithms which will eliminate large chunks of graphic chip demand.
Intel, by contrast, is selling for less than 3x revenues. Its valuation ratios haven’t inflated dramatically in recent years. Indeed, INTC stock is trading at around 11x earnings, which is downright cheap in this market. While the company has had its technical stumbles in recent years, the business is still steady, and analysts see it returning to outright growth in 2023.
Intel’s Situation Is Much Better Than Folks Realize
Intel has ceded some market share in both data center and personal computing chips in recent years. The company has failed to reach needed technical specifications on several fronts, letting AMD in particular regain its momentum.
However, traders have vastly overestimated the scope of Intel’s problems. It has grown revenues each of the past five years through 2020. While 2021 will likely be a down year, it should return to growth in the near future. The company’s earnings have also grown sharply in recent years even with the company’s well-publicized technical issues.
Indeed, in 2020, Intel generated $35 billion in cash flow from operations and $23 billion of operating income. Both of those represent record highs for Intel in a year. AMD, by contrast, generated just $1.1 billion of cash flow and $1.4 billion of operating income for full-year 2020.
Despite Intel being ten times as profitable and cash flow generative as AMD, it sells for just a 50% greater market capitalization. Notably, Intel also spends $13 billion per year in research & development as opposed to just $2 billion at AMD. Over time, be wary of counting out the dominant player with a huge advantage in scale, profitability, and research capacity.
INTC Stock Verdict
For traders that think that the current growth correction is almost over, Intel isn’t the best buy today. Intel isn’t going to be a stock that can likely double or triple in six months. However, if you’re looking for a more defensive name that can hold its ground if the current sell-off turns into a full-on collapse, INTC stock is a strong pick.
The company’s large and predictable cash flow streams insulate it from near-term shocks. It pays a healthy dividend. Its research & development budget is enormous, giving it ample firepower to develop industry-leading new products. And its various other ventures, such as self-driving vehicle technology, offer an appealing upside beyond the core business.

2021-10-08 00:00:00+00:00,Better Semiconductor Stock: TSMC vs. UMC,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/better-semiconductor-stock%3A-tsmc-vs.-umc-2021-10-08,,,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) has attracted a lot of attention as the global chip shortage has worsened over the past two years. As the world's largest and most advanced contract chipmaker, TSMC is a linchpin of the semiconductor sector, and the chip shortage probably won't end until it significantly increases its capacity.
However, TSMC's smaller Taiwanese rival, United Microelectronics (NYSE: UMC), attracts a lot less attention. That's probably because UMC manufactures larger and older chips instead of the cutting-edge ones that dominate TSMC's manufacturing plants.
Image source: Getty Images.
Over the past 12 months, UMC's stock price has rallied nearly 120% as TSMC's stock price advanced about 30%. Over the past five years, UMC's stock price skyrocketed nearly 480% as TSMC's stock rose about 250%.
Have investors been paying attention to the wrong Taiwanese chip foundry all this time?
The key differences between TSMC and UMC
TSMC controlled 52.9% of the pure wafer foundry market in the second quarter of 2021, according to TrendForce. Samsung ranked second with a 17.3% share, followed by UMC with a 7.3% share.
TSMC manufactures chips of all sizes, but it generated 49% of its revenue from its smallest 5nm and 7nm nodes in its most recent quarter. TSMC and Samsung are the only two foundries that manufacture 5nm and 7nm chips, but TSMC's chips have a higher transistor density than Samsung's -- which makes its manufacturing process the most advanced in the world.
That's why the world's top fabless chipmakers, including Advanced Micro Devices, Apple, and Qualcomm, all outsource their highest-end chips to TSMC. That's also why there's a major traffic jam at TSMC's plants.
UMC doesn't manufacture any chips beyond the 14nm node. Three years ago, it abandoned its efforts to develop smaller chips and focused on manufacturing less advanced chips for the automotive and Internet of Things (IoT) markets instead. UMC noted that developing more advanced chips would be too capital-intensive and that its market opportunity was smaller than its market for older chips.
UMC has the capability to manufacture 14nm chips, but it isn't generating any meaningful revenue from that higher-end node yet. Instead, it generated 58% of its revenue by manufacturing 65nm, 40nm, 28nm, and 22nm chips last quarter, while the rest came from even older nodes.
UMC's plants have been operating at maximum capacity this year, but it faces less pressure to aggressively build new plants like TSMC because other foundries -- like GlobalFoundries and China's SMIC -- can also manufacture comparable chips for the automotive and IoT markets.
Which company is growing faster?
TSMC's revenue grew 4% in 2019 and jumped 25% in 2020, and analysts expect its revenue to rise 18% this year. They expect its revenue to grow another 18% in 2022 as the chip shortage drags on.
UMC's operating revenue declined 2% in 2019 as it retreated from higher-end chips. But its revenue rose 19% in 2020 as demand for its mid- to lower-end chips accelerated, and analysts anticipate 18% sales growth this year followed by 10% growth in 2022.
UMC's underlying technologies and revenue growth rates are less impressive than TSMC's, but its shift toward lower-end nodes enabled it to generate stronger earnings growth. TSMC's net income increased 50% in 2020, but UMC's net income nearly tripled.
Analysts expect TSMC's net income to rise 12% this year, even as it starts executing an ambitious three-year $100 billion plan to boost its capacity. But they expect UMC's net income to more than double this year as it maintains stable capex levels and avoids the spending war between TSMC and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), which has set an ambitious goal of reclaiming its lead in the process race from TSMC by 2025.
The tortoise or the hare?
TSMC is still growing rapidly, but it's paying a high price to maintain its lead against Samsung and Intel. UMC is also generating robust growth, but it's maintaining a lower profile, serving lower-end markets, and isn't allocating tens of billions of dollars toward the construction of new cutting-edge plants.
TSMC's stock looks reasonably valued at 21 times next year's earnings, but UMC trades at just 13 times next year's earnings -- even though it's already outperformed its larger rival over the past 12 months.
UMC is essentially the tortoise of the foundry sector to TSMC's hare. Both of these companies are still sound long-term investments in the semiconductor sector, but I believe UMC's more conservative approach will enable it to generate bigger gains than TSMC for the foreseeable future.

2021-10-08 00:00:00+00:00,"If You Invested $1,000 in AMD in 2014, This Is How Much You Would Have Today",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/if-you-invested-%241000-in-amd-in-2014-this-is-how-much-you-would-have-today-2021-10-08,,,"When Lisa Su became Advanced Micro Devices' (NASDAQ: AMD) CEO on Oct. 8, 2014, the chipmaker's stock traded at about $3 per share. Today, AMD trades at just over $100 per share -- so a $1,000 investment in the chipmaker on Su's first day would be worth more than $31,000 today.
During those seven years, a $1,000 investment in AMD's rival Intel would be worth less than $1,600 today. Let's look back at how AMD generated such massive gains in such a short time.
AMD CEO Lisa Su. Image source: AMD.
How did AMD become a penny stock?
Between the first quarter of 2006 and the fourth quarter of 2014, AMD's share of the x86 CPU market plunged from 48.4% to 23.4%, according to PassMark Software. Intel's share increased from 51.6% to 76.6%.
AMD struggled against Intel for three main reasons: First, its acquisition of ATI in 2006, which formed the foundation of its discrete GPU business, diverted resources from its CPU business and forced it to aggressively compete against Nvidia.
Second, Intel struck back at AMD's budget CPUs with a new generation of 45nm chips in 2007, a year before AMD rolled out its first 45nm chips. Intel pulled PC makers away from AMD, and AMD struggled to match Intel's research & development and marketing firepower as it integrated its new GPU business.
Lastly, AMD's 32nm Bulldozer CPUs, which arrived in 2011, disappointed original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and consumers with its dismal single-thread performance. All those mistakes caused AMD's revenue growth to stall out and decline from $5.65 billion in 2006 to $5.51 billion in 2014. Its stock, which traded in the low $40s in 2006, became a penny stock by the time Dr. Lisa Su took over.
How AMD made a comeback
Su brought AMD back from the brink with three main strategies: First, she diversified AMD's business beyond PCs and into gaming consoles.
Su previously led the development of custom APUs, which merged together AMD's CPUs and GPUs, for gaming consoles before she became the company's CEO. Sony's PS4 and Microsoft's Xbox One both used AMD's APUs when they arrived in late 2013, and sales of those chips turned AMD's enterprise, embedded, and semi-custom (EESC) business into a major growth engine.
Stable sales of gaming APUs generated fresh cash for AMD, reduced its dependence on CPU and GPU sales for PCs, and bought it more time to develop new chips. Sony and Microsoft also continued to use AMD's APUs in their newest PS5 and Xbox Series S and X consoles, respectively.

Second, AMD went back to the drawing board to design new chips which addressed the Bulldozer generation's shortcomings. In 2017, it launched its Ryzen CPUs for PCs and Epyc CPUs for servers -- which were widely praised for their robust performance.
Lastly, AMD switched from GlobalFoundries, its former foundry unit which was spun off in 2009, to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSMC) as its main manufacturing partner for higher-end chips in 2018.
As a result, AMD started to produce more advanced chips than Intel, since TSMC had already surpassed Intel's internal foundry in the ""process race"" to manufacture smaller and denser chips. Intel also struggled with constant shortages and delays, which caused more OEMs to switch to AMD.
The market embraced AMD's new chips. Between the third quarter of 2016 and the second quarter of 2021, AMD's market share in CPUs jumped from 17.5% to a 15-year high of 44.1%, according to PassMark Software. Intel's market share tumbled from 82.5% to 55.8%.
Between 2015 and 2020, AMD's annual revenue soared from $3.99 billion to $9.76 billion. Its adjusted gross margin expanded from 28% to 45%, and its adjusted net income surged from $132 million to $1.58 billion. That's why its penny stock became a growth stock again.
But can AMD maintain its momentum?
Analysts expect AMD's revenue and adjusted earnings to rise 60% and 93%, respectively, this year, but its growth will likely decelerate next year for a few reasons.
AMD could still struggle with the ongoing chip shortages, and its shares of the CPU and GPU markets have been gradually shrinking in the second half of 2021 as Intel and Nvidia rolled out newer chips. The chip shortages have also been curbing Sony's and Microsoft's shipments of the PS5 and Xbox Series consoles, respectively, which were expected to boost AMD's EESC sales in 2020 and 2021.
I'm still bullish on AMD's long-term prospects with Dr. Lisa Su at the helm, but I doubt it will replicate its multibagger gains over the next seven years. Nonetheless, I still believe AMD's market cap could eclipse Intel's over the next few years -- especially if Intel's ambitious turnaround plans flop. It remains a great long-term investment in the semiconductor sector.

1. Nvidia
It's easy to become distracted by the noise surrounding Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) right now. Some are worried about how long the chip shortage will go on. Others are concerned about the possibility that Intel will recapture market share from Nvidia in the gaming market.
All of this misses the big picture. Nvidia's long-term growth prospects remain outstanding. Even if the company surrendered some market share in gaming (which isn't a foregone conclusion), the market continues to expand enough for Nvidia to continue winning.
It's a similar story with the data center market. Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) should enjoy robust demand for a long time to come in powering data center servers. That will be likely even if rivals become more competitive.
Increased adoption of artificial intelligence in apps and in self-driving cars presents massive growth opportunities for Nvidia. The emergence of the metaverse -- a 3D virtual universe that many predict will be the future of the internet -- should provide an even greater catalyst for the company. Nvidia is an unstoppable stock because it's poised to profit from these unstoppable trends.
2. Square
Speaking of unstoppable trends, the shift away from cash to digital payments is definitely one of them. And Square (NYSE: SQ) stands out as one of the top fintech stocks that are making this shift happen.
Square started out enabling small businesses to process credit card payments. Over the years, the company has built out a full-blown ecosystem supporting small to medium-sized businesses. Square has plenty of room to grow this seller ecosystem by offering new products and services, expanding internationally, and targeting larger customers.
Arguably the most important growth driver for Square's seller ecosystem in the future is that the company recently obtained a banking charter. But this charter is also critical for Square's other ecosystem targeting individuals -- Cash App.
Cash App already enables users to transfer money to their friends, invest, prepare taxes, and more. It will soon allow customers to buy now and pay later thanks to Square's acquisition of AfterPay.
Look for Square to add banking services in the not-too-distant future. The company could disrupt traditional banking in a big way. In doing so, its stock seems likely to be a huge winner for investors over the next decade and beyond.
3. Vertex Pharmaceuticals
Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: VRTX) hasn't been a winner so far this year. The biotech stock is down more than 20%. However, Wall Street analysts think that Vertex could rebound in a major way. They have good reasons for this optimism.
Most importantly, Vertex's cystic fibrosis (CF) drugs still have plenty of room for sales growth. The company estimates that there are 83,000 individuals with CF in the U.S., Canada, Europe, and Australia. More than 30,000 of them could benefit from Vertex's CF drugs but aren't yet.
Meanwhile, Vertex hopes to expand beyond CF. The company and its partner, CRISPR Therapeutics, hope to file for regulatory approvals of gene-editing therapy CTX001 in 2023 for treating rare blood diseases beta-thalassemia and sickle cell disease. Vertex expects to report key data this year from a phase 2 study of VX-147 in treating focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, a rare genetic kidney disease.
The big biotech is also targeting a couple of not-so-rare diseases. Vertex is evaluating VX-548 in phase 2 clinical studies as a treatment for acute pain. It's also testing gene therapy VX-880 in an early stage clinical study in treating type 1 diabetes. In addition, Vertex has a growing cash stockpile that it's likely to use in funding business development deals that bolster its pipeline.

2021-10-07 00:00:00+00:00,November 26th Options Now Available For Intel (INTC),INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/november-26th-options-now-available-for-intel-intc-2021-10-07,,,"Investors in Intel Corp (Symbol: INTC) saw new options become available today, for the November 26th expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the INTC options chain for the new November 26th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $54.00 strike price has a current bid of $2.21. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $54.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $51.79 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of INTC, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $54.57/share today.
Because the $54.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 55%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 4.09% return on the cash commitment, or 29.85% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Intel Corp, and highlighting in green where the $54.00 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $56.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.63. If an investor was to purchase shares of INTC stock at the current price level of $54.57/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $56.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 5.61% if the stock gets called away at the November 26th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if INTC shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Intel Corp, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing INTC's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $56.00 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $56.00 strike represents an approximate 3% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 2.99% boost of extra return to the investor, or 21.79% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.
The implied volatility in the put contract example above is 33%.
Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $54.57) to be 33%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

2021-10-07 00:00:00+00:00,3 Reasons Qualcomm's Acquisition of Veoneer Could Make It an Unstoppable Connected Car Stock,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-reasons-qualcomms-acquisition-of-veoneer-could-make-it-an-unstoppable-connected-car,,,"A more connected mobile world is being built in earnest. However, a key piece of consumer hardware squarely in technology companies' crosshairs is vehicles. Often running on chips and circuitry that are decades old, many automakers are scrambling to get their models up to date with the latest in connectivity, electric drivetrains, and advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS).
To that end, it shouldn't go unnoticed that Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM) and investment firm SSW Partners just reached a definitive agreement to acquire auto tech company Veoneer (NYSE: VNE). The deal values the small technologist at $4.5 billion (to be paid as $37 per share in cash to Veoneer shareholders). This buyout could let Qualcomm, a leader in mobile chips for smartphones and related devices, seriously ramp up its presence on the road. Here are three reasons why.
Image source: Getty Images.
When chip designers also become auto suppliers
It's clear Qualcomm really wants in on the auto industry, and for good reason. Tens of millions of vehicles are sold globally every year, and by the end of this decade, an estimated half of a car's cost of production will be electronic components (up from about 40% now). As a result, one of the most profitable parts of the auto industry supply chain is high-end tech.
Thus the agreement to acquire Veoneer, which reports in two primary segments: Active safety (i.e., ADAS) and restraint control systems (tightening of seatbelts and deployment of airbags in case of an accident). Qualcomm and SSW Partners actually outbid Canadian auto supplier Magna (NYSE: MGA) for Veoneer, which had offered Veoneer shareholders $31.25 per share in cash this past summer.
But Qualcomm isn't interested in airbags and seatbelts. SSW Partners will retain that business segment and sell the active safety division to Qualcomm, which will augment its own ADAS platform with Veoneer's software and designs for sensors including radar, LiDAR, camera-based vision, and the like. Paired with Qualcomm's mobile processors, the auto industry will have a new powerful product partner for designing advanced safety controls, progressively more autonomous vehicle functionality, and connectivity features.
Creating compelling reasons to upgrade chip designs
Unifying more parts and systems of a car to a single supplier can help an automaker boost profit margins. After all, bulk orders often mean lower average cost per unit purchased.
But for Qualcomm, its strategy is more than just boosting how many pieces of a vehicle's tech system it can sell. It's also about creating a compelling platform that automakers will spring for in the first place. After all, many components are mission-critical in a car, so a tried-and-true system is better than upgrading to the latest circuitry designs that might require a total overhaul for auto engineers.
Thus, Veoneer is only part of a grander strategy. This past summer, Qualcomm also purchased CPU designer NUVIA. NUVIA's CPUs will find primary use in smartphones and laptops. But at the time the acquisition was made, Qualcomm said NUVIA will also be applied in other emerging departments for Qualcomm, like digital cockpits (the multiple digital screens displaying info within new cars that have mostly replaced traditional instrument clusters) and driver-assist systems.
Put another way, Qualcomm is stitching together multiple technologies via acquisition and its own in-house development for all sorts of tech within the modern vehicle. If it can update enough of these components and get them all working together fluidly, it might be able to convince automakers to start upgrading to newer (and more profitable, for Qualcomm) semiconductors and related hardware.
Diversifying away from future ""legacy"" products
Through the first nine months of its 2021 fiscal year, over three-quarters of Qualcomm's business is derived from the mobile industry -- mostly component designs for smartphones. Qualcomm has a stranglehold on some of these mobility chips, but it could be facing losses in this department in the years ahead. Apple, for example, acquired Intel's mobile modem business. This is clearly a shot at Qualcomm's very profitable smartphone supplier relationship as Apple may intend to bring modem design in-house.
But Veoneer will help Qualcomm up its game on a new front. Qualcomm's auto segment hauled in just $253 million in the last reported quarter (or a measly 4% of total revenue). Veoneer's active safety division hauled in $197 million in its latest quarter. Once combined, Qualcomm could be looking at a nearly 80% jump in automotive sales including the acquired business -- with much more growth on the way if it can convince more automakers to use its expanding connected vehicle platform.
To be sure, automotive products would still represent a small fraction of Qualcomm's total business even after adding Veoneer, but it's well on its way to extending its mobility chips to the auto world. Advanced driver assist systems, vehicle autonomy, and connectivity are still early on in development, and Qualcomm clearly has its sights set on being a leader in this space.

This article was originally published on Simply Wall St News
Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) is a US$218b market cap company which had a volatile last three years. The stock had many ups and downs, and ultimately has made 15.9% return over that period. The volatility has selected out a certain type of investor, and we will be examining if the stock is appropriate for long-term holders.
Value in stocks can be derived in multiple ways, the two most frequent approaches are the growth stock, when a company is in a high-growth phase, and the other being the value phase, when a stock's cash flows are mispriced and have the potential to increase due to efficiencies, value maximization policies or other catalysts.
See our latest analysis for Intel
Before estimating the value of Intel's cash flows, we will preview a snapshot of the performance of the company:
NasdaqGS:INTC Performance Snapshot, October 6th 2021
Intel is making US$77.6 in revenues and has a relatively high profit margin of 23.9%. The earnings are estimated to slowly decrease and keep a stable level around US$17b. This may caution some investors, and that is why we will see jut how much of the net income will translate to free cash flows for investors.
Today we will run through one way of estimating the intrinsic value of Intel by using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model.
We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you.
Crunching the numbers
Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:

Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$102b
After calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage.
For a number of reasons, a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth.
In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.3%.
Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2031 × (1 + g) ÷ (r * g) = US$18b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (7.3%* 2.0%) = US$353b
Present Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$353b÷ ( 1 + 7.3%)10= US$175b
The total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$277b.
Relative to the current share price of US$54.0, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 21% discount to where the stock price trades currently.
The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.
NasdaqGS:INTC Discounted Cash Flow October 6th 2021
We can see that although Intel may not be a company that is growing, the vast cash flows in the company might be undervalued even at current levels.
Our model suggests that in a period of stability or the appearance of a catalyst, the stock has some upwards potential. Keep in mind that this might not necessarily happen, as macro trends and competitors may draw investors away from Intel.
Key Takeaways
Intel has the potential to converge to value even at current levels. The stock's cash flows seem to be mispriced and this might leave an opportunity for investors.
The company has a volatile stock price and reduced growth. This could have possibly led some investors to pull away from the company as it transitions to a value stock. The company itself can still innovate and increase efficacy, which is an additional reason why the current stock price might not be capturing the full potential of the technology.

It seemed natural for shares of Chinese electric vehicle maker Nio (NYSE:NIO) to correct after surging from $2.11 in March 2020 to a high just below $67 in January — a gain of more than 3,000% in less than 10 months. Additionally, factors like the chip shortage and regulatory headwinds in China negatively impacted investor sentiment. So far this year, NIO stock is down around 30%.

However, I believe that current levels are attractive for accumulation. NIO stock seems positioned for a strong rally in the coming years. And I would not be surprised if shares take out their previous highs in the next few quarters.
Nio Seeing Strong Growth in Its Home Market
Overall auto sales have slowed in China, and much of the rest of the world, due to the continued shortage of computer chips crimping production. However, Chinese electric vehicle makers are still poised to benefit from spectacular growth.
That’s because China has set ambitious targets for sales of new energy vehicles (NEVs), which include battery-powered and hybrid electric vehicles. By 2025, the Chinese government expects 20% of new car sales to be new energy vehicles. By 2030, Chinese automakers estimate NEV sales will make up 70% to 90% of market share.
7 Top-Rated Pharmaceutical Stocks To Invest in for October
According to Cui Dongshu, secretary general of the China Passenger Car Association, China’s NEV sales accounted for close to half of the world’s NEV sales in the first seven months of 2021. And Fu Bingfeng, executive vice chairman of the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers, said in June that he expects NEV sales in China to grow more than 40% annually for the next five years.
This growth pathway spells huge opportunity for Nio, which was the highest-producing EV startup in China for the month of September, beating out competitors Xpeng (NYSE:XPEV) and Li Auto (NASDAQ:LI). Nio sold 10,628 electric vehicles last month, ahead of the company’s guidance despite the ongoing chip shortage. This represented a 126% increase from a year ago.
For the third quarter, Nio doubled the number of vehicle deliveries year over year to 24,439 vehicles, which also came in ahead of expectations. Once the temporary chip shortage headwind subsides, it’s likely Nio’s vehicle deliveries will accelerate further.
Another factor that will support sales growth is the launch of Nio’s ET7 sedan in early 2022. The company expects to sell 50,000 units next year.
Nio’s introduction of battery-as-a-service is also worth noting. As the company explains it: “Enabled by vehicle-battery separation, battery subscription and the chargeable, swappable and upgradable batteries, NIO BaaS is a breakthrough innovation in both technology and business model.”
The program launched in August 2020, with the goal of providing an improved power service experience to its fast-growing user base. This summer, Nio announced its NIO Power 2025 battery swap station deployment plan. By the end of 2025, Nio plans to have 3,000 battery swap stations in China and another 1,000 around the world. BaaS provides Nio with another avenue for revenue and should help the company create loyal customers.
Nio Is Expanding Internationally
China is clearly the biggest market for Nio, but the company is expanding internationally as well.
At the end of September, Nio launched the ES8 SUV in Norway. The launch of ET7 in the country is scheduled for next year, and the ET7 is expected to debut in Germany toward the end of 2022.
This is likely to be just the beginning, as Nio founder William Li has said the company is eyeing launches in four more European countries in addition to Germany. These new markets should help accelerate growth in vehicle deliveries in 2022 and beyond.
Another development that’s likely to have a positive impact on Nio’s international growth plans is the pilot launch of Mobileye’s autonomous taxis and ride-hailing services in Germany and Isreal next year. Mobileye, Intel’s (NASDAQ:INTC) self-driving vehicle technology unit, struck a deal with Nio to use its SE8s for the program.
This program should provide Nio with more exposure and credibility in European markets. And given Mobileye’s plans to bring self-driving cars to the masses by 2025, a successful pilot program could result in further collaboration between the companies.
The Bottom Line on NIO Stock
With the rapid growth in deliveries, Nio saw vehicle margin expand significantly in the second quarter to 20.3%, compared with 9.7% in the same quarter of 2020. It seems likely key margins will improve further with operating leverage. And significant investment in research and development is likely to keep Nio ahead of the curve in an increasingly competitive market.
Nio has ample financial headroom for growth in China. Nio’s joint manufacturing agreement with Jianghuai Automobile Group has an annual production capacity of 240,000 vehicles, positioning the company to meet the growing demand for electric vehicles in China. What’s more, Nio is making moves internationally to expand its market.
Overall, with several positive developments and ambitious growth plans, NIO stock looks attractive. Strong upside in shares is likely in the coming quarters.

The world has been chasing the digitization revolution for decades. The pandemic shutdown accelerated the push and the world is at full throttle to get into full digital mode. For this to happen, we need exponentially more computing power. This plays right into technology companies like Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). INTC stock, however, is not feeling the love yet this year.

In fact, the slump started a long while ago, so it’s not a new development. The current share price is the same as it was in 2018. Moreover, this was also a point of contention during the dot-com battle in 2000.
There have been big rallies in the company’s stock, especially from 2017. But there were also pretty deep valleys offsetting the rallies.
INTC Stock Sleeper Trade
In the last 12 months, INTC stock is languishing only up 5%. Its two main competitors Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) are up four and 10 times more, respectively. These two are hogging the headlines because they are being more innovative.
Consensus on Wall Street is that Nvidia is the trendsetter, but I prefer AMD stock. Even though they are both very fast growers and valuation shouldn’t matter, AMD stock is much cheaper.
7 Financial Stocks to Buy to Get Ready for the Fed’s Next Move
Speaking of cheap stocks, Intel is most definitely the king of that among its peers. My thesis today is that it is a sleeper winning trade into the middle of next year.
Perception does sometimes influence price in wrong directions. Today, the “loser” tag it carries is the opportunity for patient investors. In reality, Intel is still a behemoth in the field. The good news is that INTC stock does not get the respect it deserves.
All Substance, No Filler
This is a high-tech company that has an 11 P/E, which is lower than Bank of America (NYSE:BAC). A giant tech stock should not be cheaper than a bank stocks. INTC price-to-sales is almost embarrassing at 2.8. In reality, they still grow revenues and net income, and generate $35 billion in cash from operations. Moreover, their gross profit is five times bigger than AMD and three times than Nvidia. It may lack pizazz but it certainly doesn’t lack substance.
This prism is the fault of the management team. It is their job to raise awareness and excitement. Experts are starting to come around on that point, so there might be some green shoots coming. Wall Street has a habit of over-focusing on one side, while forgetting about a sleeper in another corner.
INTC stock could be the one to surprise us soon, but it is definitely taking its time. The window is closing because this bull market is aging. Recently, investor sentiment has soured to the point that we have one foot out the door. The macroeconomic conditions have not deteriorated, but some of the tailwinds are leaving via the taper process.
The Economy Is Fine
Source: Charts by TradingView
We will still have a QE until at least the middle of next year. This is not counting the very low rates, and the trillions already in the economy. If the stock markets stabilizes, INTC stock has opportunities into the holiday season. The political headlines about the debt ceiling are adding to the fears. That’s what politicians do, they take us to the brink to force decisions.
Therefore and first, the Intel bulls have to hold support above $51 per share. This is important so they can tackle the resistance near $58. Until then, INTC stock investors have to sit patiently or use options strategies to put their assets to work. Selling calls against positions in stagnant stocks makes sense for some people. This is like creating synthetic dividends from an asset that is languishing.
I am optimistic, but loading up long Intel stock now is not an obvious winning strategy. Taking partial positions makes for smarter risk management. It really comes down to investor time frames.
There isn’t one answer that fits all investors the same. It is OK to have a very long-term outlook and not care about short-term generations. As it is acceptable to trade around the shorter-term action. Either case, investors would do well not going all in mostly because of extrinsic factors and risks.

2021-10-06 00:00:00+00:00,"U.S. Senate Democrats plan debt-limit vote, Biden hints filibuster could go",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/u.s.-senate-democrats-plan-debt-limit-vote-biden-hints-filibuster-could-go-2021-10-06,,,"By Andy Sullivan and Susan Cornwell
WASHINGTON, Oct 6 (Reuters) - Senate Democrats are set to try again on Wednesday to extend the U.S. government's borrowing authority to head off a catastrophic default, after President Joe Biden suggested they could change the chamber's rules to bypass a Republican roadblock.
Republicans for months have refused to help raise the self-imposed $28.4 trillion borrowing cap, instead trying to force Democrats to use a different parliamentary maneuver to do so in hopes of scoring political points with voters.
With less than two weeks to go before the Treasury Department expects to run out of ways to meet the government's expenses, Democrats are looking at all their options.
Biden said on Tuesday that it was ""real possibility"" that Democrats might use their current razor-thin majority to drop the Senate's filibuster rule, which requires 60 of the chamber's 100 members to agree to pass most legislation.
Biden, himself a former Senator, had previously opposed changes to the filibuster, which is meant to help maintain government stability through election cycles.
If Democrats follow through, they could easily suspend the debt ceiling before the deadline of about Oct. 18. That would head off the risk of a crippling default and allow them to focus on passing two mammoth spending bills that make up the bulk of Biden's domestic agenda.
In an effort to underline the severe economic risks of a default, Biden will meet on Wednesday with a group including CEOs of major corporations including JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N, Intel Corp INTC.O and Nasdaq Inc NDAQ.O.
Many Democrats have long argued that the Senate should dump the filibuster entirely, saying it prevents progress on climate change, voting rights and other priorities. The chamber already allows federal judges, including Supreme Court justices, to win approval on a straight majority vote.
Centrist Democratic senators including Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema have said repeatedly they are not willing to dump the filibuster, which would leave the party short of the votes they need to change the rule, however. They could not be reached for comment on whether Biden's words would change their minds.
Democratic Senators John Hickenlooper and Ron Wyden on Tuesday said they were open to dropping the filibuster requirement for the debt-limit vote. Manchin declined to comment when asked about it prior to Biden's remarks.
The Senate was due to hold a Wednesday afternoon procedural vote that would allow them to begin debating a bill that would suspend the debt limit until December 2022, after the elections that will determine control of Congress for the next two years.
That passed the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives last week but Republicans have stalled it in the Senate with the filibuster.
Without a quick resolution, some government services might be suspended, such as delivering Social Security benefit checks to the elderly.
Even a close call would likely be damaging. A 2011 debt ceiling dispute, which Congress resolved two days before the borrowing limit was due to have been reached, caused stocks to tumble and prompted a first-ever credit downgrade for U.S. debt.
The Bipartisan Policy Center on Wednesday issued forecasts on when some federal payments could be postponed as a result of the standoff. Among them: Unemployment insurance payments due Oct. 20 could be delayed five days, federal salaries for civilian employees due Oct. 29 could be pushed back to Nov. 9 and Medicare payments to doctors could be delayed from Nov. 1 to Nov. 19.
Moody's Investors Service said on Tuesday it expects Washington will raise the debt limit.
Democratic Senator Mark Warner said Congress was already risking U.S. creditworthiness, however.
""We're in the danger zone right now,"" he told reporters on Tuesday.

2021-10-06 00:00:00+00:00,Thinking Of Buying Intel Stock? Buy Texas Instruments Instead,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/thinking-of-buying-intel-stock-buy-texas-instruments-instead-2021-10-06,,,"We think that Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN) currently is a better pick compared to Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). TI stock trades at about 11x trailing revenues, compared to around 3x for Intel. Does this gap in the companies’ valuations make sense? We believe so. While both the companies have benefited in the pandemic, with an overall increase in demand for their products, Intel has struggled due to delays in its next-generation chipsets, combined with gradually losing Apple as a client (Apple has shifted to in-house chipsets for their laptops). On the other hand, Texas Instruments has seen strong revenue and EBIT growth, which reflects in its surging valuation multiples. TI’s revenues have jumped from $14.4 billion in FY’19 to $16.8 billion on an LTM basis. Operating margins have risen strongly from 39.8% to 45.2% over this period. Meanwhile, Intel has seen revenue rise from $72 billion in FY ’19 to $77.6 billion on an LTM basis, with EBIT margins, in fact, dropping from 32.8% to 29.1% over this period. However, there is more to the comparison, which makes TI a better bet than Intel at these valuations. Let’s step back to look at the fuller picture of the relative valuation of the two companies by looking at historical revenue growth as well as operating income and operating margin growth. Our dashboard Texas Instruments vs Intel: Industry Peers; Which Stock Is A Better Bet? has more details on this. Parts of the analysis are summarized below.
1. Texas Instruments Is The Clear Winner On Revenue Growth
Texas Instruments had a hard time in FY 2019, amidst the semiconductor supply glut, with revenue dropping to $14.4 billion from $15.8 billion in FY 2018. Back then, Intel saw its revenues rise from $70.8 billion in FY ’18 to $72 billion in FY ’19. However, Intel has had a tough time since then, amidst delays in its next generation processors and gradually losing Apple as a customer. Since FY 2019, Intel’s revenues have risen from $72 billion to $77.6 billion on an LTM basis, a growth of 7.8%. On the other hand, TI’s revenues rose from $14.4 billion to $16.8 billion over the same period, a rise of 19%.
While Intel is a larger company, with almost 5x the revenue of that of Texas Instruments, TI’s significantly stronger revenue growth makes it a better bet.
2. Texas Instruments The Winner Again On Margins
TI’s EBIT margins rose from 39.8% in FY 2019 to 45.2% on an LTM basis. In comparison, Intel has seen its margins drop, going from 32.8% in FY 2019 to 29.1% over the last four quarters. While the dent in Intel’s revenues has dripped down to its margins, TI’s cost-cutting initiatives have been paying off, leading to consistent EBIT margin growth in line with the jump in revenues.
3. Texas Instruments In A Better Net Cash Position
TI’s debt-to-equity ratio currently stands at 3.5%, almost one-fifth that of Intel’s 16.3%. Further, TI has a better cash cushion, with cash as a % of assets standing at 35.9%, significantly higher than Intel’s 5.3%. We believe that TI is at a significantly lower financial risk as compared to Intel.
The Net of It All
While Intel’s revenues are much larger than that of TI, the latter has seen stellar growth in revenues and operating margins compared to Intel. Looking at the post-Covid recovery, TI has fared far better than Intel, with LTM revenues more than 19% higher than the pre-Covid fiscal year (FY 2019), while Intel’s LTM revenues stand only around 8% higher than those in FY 2019. While TI has a significantly higher P/EBIT ratio of 24x vs Intel’s 10x, and a higher P/S ratio at 11x vs Intel’s 3x, TI has the potential to continue on its run, supported by strong financials. We think this gap in valuation could further widen over time. As such, we believe that Texas Instruments is currently a better buying opportunity compared to Intel stock.

2021-10-05 00:00:00+00:00,Which ‘Old Tech’ Stocks Will Benefit From Windows 11 Launch?,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/which-old-tech-stocks-will-benefit-from-windows-11-launch-2021-10-05,,,"W
indows 11 officially launched today, and if past updates are anything to go by, the reaction will follow a pattern. First, tech reviewers will generally like it, since the new OS version will offer improvements and be more technologically advanced than its predecessor. Then, as users start to download, there will be complaints on social media and elsewhere. Some complaints will have to do with actual, addressable issues in the software, but others will be from people who got used to Windows 10 and find any change disconcerting. After a while, 11 will become the norm, the confused will get used to it, and even the holdouts will look to download it. Currently, there are 1.3 billion devices running Windows 10, so clearly the change will be an investment opportunity of some kind.
The best opportunities, however, may not be in Microsoft (MSFT). I am bullish on MSFT, but not because of Windows 11. The new OS will be a free download for existing Windows 10 users, so won’t produce revenue there. But there will inevitably be problems, which will take time and money to fix. If anything, the launch could be a drag on MSFT for a while. However, the strength that Microsoft has shown in their commercial and cloud business will more than offset that, and the recent weakness will make the stock look attractive on that basis alone.
That said, those looking to profit specifically from the launch should concentrate elsewhere.
We don’t know at this point exactly how many PCs won’t be able to take the upgrade, but there are system requirements, which probably means that it will be a decent percentage of those 1.3 billion currently running Windows 10. We can’t live without computers and Windows 10 is being phased out by 2025. That will inevitably cause a boost to PC sales of some kind in the coming months, and even a smallish percentage of 1.3 billion is a big number. That means a period of growth for PC makers like HP (HPQ) and Dell (DELL).
Of those two, my preference would be for HPQ. Even without the boost from Windows 11, a strong case can be made for it at current levels.
As you can see, HPQ is down more than 20 percent from its high in May. That is a result of the chip shortage that has been restricting sales, but, logically, that situation must end before too long. And when it does end, there will be some pent-up demand even without the boost from Windows 11.
What makes HPQ so attractive is that it is a great value based on the currently anticipated growth level, so any beat of that will result in an exaggerated response in the stock. It has trailing and forward P/Es of 8.6 and 7.3, respectively, and a PEG ratio, where anything below 1.0 represents value, of 0.89. No matter how you look at it, HPQ is cheap, especially by current standards.
Of course, if PC sales are growing, suppliers to the industry will also benefit. Once again, when looking there, there is one value that stands out: Intel (INTC).
Like HPQ, Intel stock has struggled since the spring. It too has been hit hard by supply issues in the industry and has disappointed in terms of growth. However, Intel is still the biggest chip manufacturer in the world and is positioned to benefit more than anyone from a boost to demand as PC users are forced to upgrade.
Again, like HPQ, INTC is value even without that boost. Both forward and trailing P/Es are below 12 as compared to the average for the S&P 500 of 30. That is largely down to disappointing growth, so the effects of a surge as PC users are forced into an upgrade cycle will be exaggerated, and a significant rise in the stock over the next few months is on the cards.
Both HPQ and INTC are in a category that I have, in the past, labelled “old tech.” They aren’t trendy names with triple-digit multiples. Instead, they are solid, mature companies with stocks that even pay a decent dividend. That makes them less sexy than some other tech stocks, but when 1.3 billion Windows users are upgrading, they have advantages that make them great buys, sexy or not.

2021-10-05 00:00:00+00:00,Amazon and Google set to attend White House forum on quantum technology,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/amazon-and-google-set-to-attend-white-house-forum-on-quantum-technology-2021-10-05,,,"By Trevor Hunnicutt
WASHINGTON, Oct 5 (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O, Google GOOGL.O and Microsoft Corp MSFT.O are expected to join a Biden administration conference on Tuesday focused on quantum technologies as the U.S. government works to head off hacking threats and corner a burgeoning growth industry.
The White House's Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) is hosting the event that will discuss critical applications of quantum computing, which is expected to operate millions of times faster than today's advanced supercomputers.
Boeing Co BA.N, Honeywell International Inc HON.N, International Business Machines Corp IBM.N, Intel Corp INTC.O and Northrop Grumman Corp NOC.N are also expected to attend, according to an administration spokesperson.
""There's a lot of excitement about quantum computers and quantum sensors, and there's some hype associated with that,"" said Charlie Tahan, assistant director for quantum information science at OSTP.
""But what we really want to get down to: what are the applications that a future quantum computer could run that could really benefit our society.""
The technology, which is based on core principles of physics, is still in its infancy but has become a darling of investors aspiring to revolutionize healthcare, finance, artificial intelligence, weather forecasting and other areas.
President Joe Biden's administration is especially focused on the national security implications of quantum technology, which promises the ability to easily crack encryption standards in use today.
China, which Washington regards as its chief rival abroad, has also made significant efforts to develop the technology.
The Biden administration is also hoping to encourage more students to enter the field and to increase cybersecurity around private research and development to prevent snooping, Tahan said.
Congress has already funneled hundreds of millions of dollars into the industry, including quantum research laboratories, and bills currently under consideration now could add billions more.
The White House meeting will also include the organizations ColdQuanta, D-Wave, IonQ, QC Ware, Quantum Economic Development-Consortium, Rigetti Computing, Vector Atomic and Zapata.
