2021-07-23 00:00:00+00:00,"Intel, TI split leaves chip outlook in doubt",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intel-ti-split-leaves-chip-outlook-in-doubt-2021-07-23-0,,,"By contrast, Intel Corp INTC.O on Thursday raised its full-year forecast, with Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger saying it could take the chip industry two years to catch up with ""explosive demand"" and predicting that a boom in PC sales driven by pandemic work-from-home arrangements would carry through next year.
Analysts, however, saw the bump in Intel's outlook as driven by a strong, already-ended second quarter, and said that it pointed to a weaker final quarter of 2021. Investors agreed, knocking as much as 6.3% off the company's shares by 1:30 p.m. Eastern Time on Friday.
Kinngai Chan, analyst at Summit Insights Group, simply did not believe Intel's predictions that the PC market will keep growing through next year.
""We disagree with Intel's view that the PC (total addressable market) will grow year-over-year in 2022,"" Chan said. ""We have seen inventory build-up for Chromebooks and gaming desktops already, and we believe supply will catch up to demand by early 4Q21 for PC notebooks as well.""
Analyst Chris Caso at Raymond James said there could also be longer-term trouble in Intel's data center business, where it predicts growth this quarter despite rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD) AMD.O having a faster chip on the market.
""We agree that capacity constraints at AMD are likely to check further significant near-term share gains - but it's just a matter of time before AMD gets access to more capacity, AMD's product cycle next year will be a catalyst, and the delay of Intel's Sapphire Rapids (data center processor chip) doesn't help,"" Caso wrote in a note.
SQUEEZE TO LAST
Still, Intel's raised forecast chimes in with a bullish outlook given by its bigger foundry rival Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC) 2330.TW, which expects strong sales growth in the current quarter, boosted by solid demand from smartphones, high-performance PCs and autos.
Auto industry executives also continue to suggest that the squeeze in semiconductor supply, also spurred by a boom in car sales this year, will stretch into next year.
Other economists and industry executives agree, and say that even if the shortage for car producers abates, other manufacturers will suffer.
For now, investors likely need to wait until next week for more clarity, with AMD, Qualcomm Inc QCOM.O, Samsung Electronics 005930.KS and SK Hynix 000660.KS all reporting results.
Combined with Intel, AMD's results should give a comprehensive view of the PC and data center markets when the company updates its outlook for the full year.
Qualcomm traditionally only forecasts one quarter in advance, but the company's dominant position in mobile phones means that investors often read its third-quarter forecast as a proxy for fall smartphone launches, including Apple Inc's AAPL.O closely watched iPhone.

2021-07-23 00:00:00+00:00,Why Intel Stock Plunged Today,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-intel-stock-plunged-today-2021-07-23,,,"What happened
Shares of Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) fell 5.3% on Friday, following the semiconductor giant's second-quarter earnings release and conference call.
So what
Intel's revenue was flat year over year at $19.6 billion, while its adjusted earnings per share rose 12% to $1.14. That was well above Wall Street's expectations, which had called for EPS of only $1.06.
""There's never been a more exciting time to be in the semiconductor industry,"" CEO Pat Gelsinger said in a press release. ""The digitization of everything continues to accelerate, creating a vast growth opportunity for us and our customers across core and emerging business areas.""

However, investors appeared to focus more on Intel's warning that the global chip shortage could persist into 2023.
Now what
Although strong demand for semiconductors and industrywide manufacturing bottlenecks are helping to preserve chipmakers' margins, they are also weighing on Intel's sales. ""We remain in a highly constrained environment where we are unable to fully supply customer demand,"" CFO George Davis said during a conference call with analysts.
Moreover, the situation is likely to get worse in the coming months before it begins to improve. ""While I expect the shortages to bottom out in the second half, it will take another one to two years before the industry is able to completely catch up with demand,"" Gelsinger said.

Today's gains come despite a 6.4% drop in Intel's (NASDAQ: INTC) share price following the company's second-quarter earnings report, released yesterday after market close, making it easily the worst performer in the index of 30 major U.S. large cap stocks.
Today's decline from Intel is being offset by a bevy of modest gains across the index, led by a 2.5% move higher by McDonald's (NYSE: MCD), with Visa (NYSE: V) and American Express (NYSE: AXP) also moving up after the latter company reported its second-quarter results, which earned a far better reception than those of Intel.

Dow on track to set an all-time high on mostly positive earnings
It's been a busy week for earnings for Dow component stocks. Yesterday brought results from Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO), Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ), and Verizon Communications (NYSE: VZ), all of which generally met investors' expectations and showed that their businesses were indeed quickly recovering from the tough year-ago periods and that the economic recovery was driving stronger sales.
Yesterday afternoon, American Express kept the streak alive, announcing 33% revenue growth and $2.3 billion in net income, up nearly tenfold. The company said part of its earnings were due to reversing $866 million in credit default reserves it took last year to bolster its balance sheet during the pandemic. In short, its customers have proven able to continue to pay their bills.
And it looks like things are on track to continue strengthening. The company said Card Member spending in June ""exceeded pre-pandemic levels,"" a huge positive for American Express, and the broader economic recovery.
Visa investors seem to think this is a positive sign for that company, too, sending its shares up over 2% at this writing despite no direct news. Visa reports earnings on July 27.
Company outlook, analyst price cuts, send Intel shares down sharply
It's been a tough year-plus for the semiconductor giant, and expectations were low heading into Intel's earnings report yesterday. Yet even with those low expectations, and results that exceeded most of them, Intel's share price is plunging today, down over 6% at this writing.
So what happened? First, Intel's quarterly results. The company reported revenue of $19.6 billion, about the same as the year-ago quarter, while adjusted earnings per share of $1.28 was a whopping $0.23 per share higher than the company's guidance from its first-quarter earnings update. That's a big beat.
However, it wasn't enough to offset continued worries about the company's progress in making up for lost ground to its competitors. This was reflected in company guidance, which called for $19 billion in revenue and adjusted earnings of $1.08 per share, a step backward from the second quarter.
Despite its full-year guidance actually being higher than it was after last quarter, Wall Street reacted quickly, with many of the analysts who follow the company lowering their price targets. It was perfect recipe for a sell-off.
Can Intel turn things around? As one analyst noted, we won't really know how its turnaround plan is working out until later this year. Intel remains solidly profitable, but major organizational changes and tens of billions in needed spending are still needed to regain its fading relevance in the semiconductor space. If you think it's on the right track, it's certainly getting more compelling. Shares are down more than 20% from the 52-week high, and the dividend yield is back above 2.5% at this writing.

NEW YORK, July 23 (Reuters) - Wall Street gained ground for the fourth straight session on Friday, extending a rally that pushed all three major U.S. stock indexes to record closing highs as upbeat earnings and signs of economic revival fueled investor risk appetite.
The S&P 500, the Nasdaq and the Dow all notched weekly gains.
""We see a continuation of the last couple days. It's roller coaster in reverse. We did the drop first, and we’ve been climbing back to the top ever since,"" said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Independent Advisor Alliance in Charlotte, North Carolina.
Growth .IGX and value .IVX stocks seesawed for much of the week as market participants weighed spiking infections of the COVID-19 Delta variant against strong corporate results and signs of economic revival.
""There’s push and pull, there’s clearly conflict in the market,"" Zaccarelli added. ""There’s a strong difference of opinion as to whether the future’s bright or whether there are clouds on the horizon.""
Market participants now look toward next week with the Federal Reserve's two-day monetary policy meeting and a series of high-profile earnings.
The Fed's statement will be parsed for clues regarding the timeframe for tightening its accommodative policies, although Chairman Jerome Powell has repeatedly said the economy still needs the central bank's full support.
Unofficially, the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 238.34 points, or 0.68%, to 35,061.69, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 44.33 points, or 1.02%, to 4,411.81 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 152.39 points, or 1.04%, to 14,836.99.
Second-quarter reporting season is firing all pistons, with 120 of the companies in the S&P 500 having reported. Of those, 88% have beaten consensus, according to Refinitiv.
""We’re seeing companies, on average, beat on the top and on the bottom line,"" Zaccarelli said. ""We’re seeing the resilience of the consumer and that’s been the story of the earnings season so far.""
Analysts now expect aggregate year-on-year S&P 500 earnings growth of 78.1% for the April to June period, a sizeable increase from the 54% annual growth seen at the beginning of the quarter.
Shares of chipmaker Intel Corp INTC.O fell after said late Thursday that it still faces supply constraints and provided disappointing guidance.
American Express Co AXP.N gained following the release second-quarter results, which handily beat expectations on the strength of a global recovery in consumer spending.
Social media firms Twitter Inc TWTR.N and Snap Inc SNAP.N advanced on the back of their upbeat results.
Those reports gave a boost to shares of Facebook Inc FB.O, which is due to post second-quarter results next week.
Other high-profile earnings expected next week include Tesla Inc TSLA.O, Apple Inc AAPL.O, Alphabet Inc GOOGL.O, Microsoft Corp MSFT.O and Amazon.com AMZN.O.
Industrials Lockheed Martin Corp LMT.N, Boeing Co BA.N, Ford Motor Co F.N, General Dynamics Corp GD.N, 3M Co MMM.N Caterpillar Inc CAT.N, Chevron Corp CVX.N and Exxon Mobil Corp XOM.N, along with a host of healthcare, consumer goods and others, are also on deck.

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.

July 23 (Reuters) - The semiconductor shortage that has gripped the world could last well into 2022 and hit smartphone production next, foreshadowing deficient supply for a range of appliances and industrial equipment, industry executives and an economist said.
The automotive sector has suffered the most this year but supply to the sector could improve relatively soon, with China taking up some production demand that Taiwan could not meet, ING Greater China chief economist Iris Pang told Reuters Global Markets Forum this week.
Taiwanese semiconductor companies have boosted production in China as blackouts and ongoing COVID-19 social distancing measures disrupted factory output and port operations in Taiwan, she said.
""China gained 5% on the chip shortage in terms of GDP - Taiwan semiconductor companies have planned well and built large factories in mainland China,"" Pang said, predicting that smartphone makers will be the next segment to face disruptions.
""Taiwanese semiconductor companies are tailoring making chips for autos, so the chip shortage should be solved for autos in a few weeks, but other electronics' chip shortage problem persists,"" Pang said, adding that could delay shipments of some new model smartphones.
Companies across industries globally have warned of an ongoing struggle to source chips.
ASML ASML.AS, one of the world's biggest suppliers to semiconductor makers, hiked its sales outlook this week on strong orders as chip giants such as TSMC 2330.TW and Intel INTC.O raced to boost output.
The broader supply crunch could last until the second quarter of 2022, said Adam Khan, founder of AKHAN Semiconductor, although he noted this timeline was ""aspirational.""
Andrew Feldman, CEO of chip startup Cerebras Systems, echoed that view, saying vendors were quoting lead times as long as 32 weeks for new chips and components.
ING's Pang said even crypto miners are seeking ways to recycle ""used"" chips, which implies the shortage wasn't going away.
Higher demand for chips, fuelled by one-off purchases to meet work-from-home needs and continuous demand for smartphones and other electronics, is expected to spur investment and growth in the sector.
The chips industry could grow between 21% to 25% in 2021, with ""electronics having its best showing since 2010,"" said Dan Hutcheson, CEO of chips-focused VLSI Research.
So far this year, the Philadelphia SE Semiconductor index .SOX has outpaced the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite .IXIC with gains of over 16% versus 13%.

2021-07-23 00:00:00+00:00,"Amkor, eBay: Value Tech Stocks Offer The Best Of Both Worlds",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/amkor-ebay%3A-value-tech-stocks-offer-the-best-of-both-worlds-2021-07-23,,,"Our theme of Value Tech Stocks – which is comprised of tech stocks with a market cap of over $5 billion and a price to earnings multiple of under 20x – has rallied by about 19% year-to-date, outperforming the S&P 500 index which is up by about 15% over the same period. We see this outperformance continuing in the coming quarters as well, as the stocks in the theme stand to benefit from increasing digitization of the economy following Covid-19 and higher corporate IT spending, without being weighed down by potentially higher interest rates and inflation concerns, unlike other high-growth, high multiple-tech stocks.
Within our theme, Amkor Technology (AMKR), a company that provides semiconductor product packaging and test services, has been the strongest performer, rising by about 48% year-to-date. The rally is being driven by strong demand for semiconductor products and recent speculation of a takeover bid by a private equity player. eBay (EBAY) stock has also fared quite well, rising by around 38%, driven by a higher interest in e-commerce through the pandemic. On the other side, video game maker Electronic Arts (EA) has been the weakest performer, with its stock down by about 2% year-to-date.
[6/3/21]  Value Tech Stocks Are Back In Favor
Our theme of Value Tech Stocks is up by about 16% year-to-date, significantly outperforming the Nasdaq-100 index which is just about 8% higher over the same period. The theme is comprised of large-cap technology stocks that trade at a trailing price to earnings multiple of under 20x. We think the outperformance is likely to continue for a couple of reasons. Firstly, inflation has been trending higher globally and this could cause Central banks to re-think their stance on ultra-low interest rates. This should cause investors to continue rotating out of growth stocks into value stocks.  Moreover, most of the companies in our theme are mature tech names and should remain a play on increasing digitization of the economy following Covid-19.
Cybersecurity player NortonLifeLock (NLOK) has been the strongest performer within our theme, with its stock up by about 37% year-to-date, driven by better than expected Q4 2021 results, which were driven by higher demand for the company’s software, following high-profile cyber attacks in recent quarters. The company also recently announced plans to carry out a $1.5 billion share repurchase program. eBay (EBAY) stock has also fared quite well, rising by around 26%, driven by higher interest in e-commerce through the pandemic. On the other hand, video game maker Electronic Arts (EA) has been the weakest performer, with its stock down by about 1.5% year-to-date.
[5/5/21] Which Value Tech Stock Should You Pick?
Our theme of Value Tech Stocks is up by about 10% year-to-date, compared to the Nasdaq-100 which is up by just about 5% over the same period. The theme includes stocks from the tech sector that have a market cap of over $10 billion, trading at a trailing price to earnings multiple of under 20x. With Covid-19 cases well off their highs in the U.S. and about a third of the U.S. population now fully vaccinated,  investors are moving away from high growth stocks and Covid-19 winners toward cyclical and value stocks. Moreover, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen says that interest rates may have to rise somewhat to keep the economy from overheating and this is another factor that could help value names. We think that value technology stocks, in particular, look attractive at this juncture, considering that they also play on the broader theme of digitization and higher corporate IT budgets post the pandemic. Below is a bit more about how the stocks in our theme have been faring.
Intel stock (NASDAQ:INTC) has been one of the strongest performers within our theme, rising by about 17% year-to-date, driven by strong semiconductor demand, large new investment plans in the foundry space, and some changes at the top management level. Cisco stock (NASDAQ:CSCO) is up by about 14% year-to-date, as enterprises are likely to increase spending on network infrastructure post the pandemic, with overall corporate IT budgets also likely to trend higher. eBay stock (NASDAQ: EBAY) is also up 14% year-to-date, as the company sees some tailwinds from the shift to e-commerce through Covid-19. However, the stock has come under pressure lately due to lighter than expected guidance for the current quarter. Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) has been the worst performer within our theme, with its stock declining by -3.5% year-to-date.
[3/8/21] Will Rising Bond Yields Help Value Tech Stocks?
Our theme of Value Tech Stocks includes technology names with a market cap of over $10 billion that are trading at a trailing P/E of under 20x.  Although the theme has underperformed since 2017, rising by just about 31%, compared to the Nasdaq-100, which has more than doubled over the period, it has fared better this year, rising 1.5% year-to-date compared to the Nasdaq-100 which is down by over 4%. There’s a good chance these stocks could continue to outperform in 2021, as rising bond yields take some sheen off higher growth names with investors potentially rotating into value stocks. For perspective, the 10-year Treasury yield has risen from around 1.1% to 1.6% in just about a month. Now, value tech stocks might hit the sweet spot in this market as they trade at reasonable valuations while playing on the broader Covid-19 theme of greater digitization and higher corporate IT spends. Moreover, most of the names in our theme are mature tech companies that are incumbents in their respective segments. Within our theme, Intel stock (NASDAQ:INTC) has been the strongest performer, rising by about 20% year-to-date driven by strong semiconductor demand and some top management changes. On the other side, Marvell (NASDAQ: MRVL) a company that develops and produces semiconductors and related technology has underperformed on account of mixed quarterly earnings, with its stock declining by about 13% year-to-date.
[2/22/2021] Will Tech’s Old Guard Beat The Market In 2021?
Our theme of Value Tech Stocks has underperformed the market in recent years, rising by just about 29% since the end of 2017, compared to the S&P 500 which is up by about 46% over the same period. The theme includes tech companies that offer essential technology products and services, have a market capitalization of over $10 billion, and trade at a trailing price to earnings multiple of under 20x. In comparison, the broader NASDAQ index trades at a much higher 40x trailing P/E. However, we believe that the stocks in our theme have lower price risk in the current market environment, and at the same time could offer reasonable upside from increasing digitization and higher corporate IT spends following Covid-19. Below is a bit more about the stocks in the theme and some trends that could help to drive them higher in the near-term.
Intel stock (NASDAQ:INTC) stock has been the best performer within our theme this year so far, rising by about 26% since early January, driven by stronger than expected Q4 results and guidance for the current quarter, and also due to the appointment of new CEO Pat Gelsinger. Moreover, demand for semiconductors has been strong across the board, with many end-markets facing chip shortages. Intel, with its sizable production capacity, should stand to gain.
Cisco stock (NASDAQ:CSCO)  is up by about 2% year-to-date. The company has been witnessing weaker demand for its networking gear as the Covid-19 pandemic caused customers to postpone deployments and also due to stronger competition. However, IT spending is expected to rebound sharply as the pandemic wanes and Cisco should be well poised to benefit. Additionally, Cisco’s pivot to a more software-centric model should also help the stock.
Oracle stock (NYSE:ORCL) stock is down by about -5.5% year-to-date. Although revenues have faced pressure in recent years as the hardware and services segments have taken a hit, the company’s cloud operations, particularly its public cloud business, could unlock a lot of value. During its most recent quarter, the company said that revenue from its Gen 2 cloud was up over 100% year-over-year. As the public cloud business continues to gain scale and the company provides more transparency, investors could potentially re-rate the stock higher.
[Updated 1/20/2021] Value Tech Stocks 
Our indicative theme of Value Tech Stocks includes relatively mature businesses that offer essential technology products and services and trade at reasonable valuations. Specifically, we have picked tech companies that are trading at a trailing price to earnings multiple of under 20x and have a market capitalization of over $10 billion. Although these stocks haven’t really rallied since our last update in November, with the Covid-19 vaccines roll out gathering steam globally, it’s likely only a matter of time before broader economic growth returns, helping value stocks, including reasonably priced technology names. Here’s a quick rundown of some value stocks in our Value tech stocks theme.
Intel (INTC) has been out of favor with investors due to increasing preference for lower-cost ARM-based chipsets and a delay in its rollout of its next-generation 7nm CPUs. However, the stock is up by about 16% year-to-date, as investors have a favorable view of Intel’s recently announced top management shakeup, which will see VMware CEO and former Intel CTO Pat Gelsinger succeed current Intel CEO, Bob Swan.
Cisco (CSCO) stock has also been listless as corporations paired back on spending on networking gear through the Covid-19 recession. However, IT spending is likely to rebound sharply over 2021 and Cisco being the go-to company for enterprise networking solutions should benefit. The company’s gradual pivoting to a more software-driven model should also help the stock. The stock is up by about 1.5% this year.
Oracle (ORCL) is a provider of database, cloud, and enterprise software products. The stock has seen steady growth over the last several years, driven by expanding earnings and its share repurchase program. The company has been expanding sales of its cloud-based applications, such as Fusion and enterprise resourcing planning services, helping to offset the slow growth of its legacy offerings. The stock is down by about -4.5% this year.
NetApp (NTAP) is a company that sells hardware and software focused on data management. While the company has seen a mixed performance in recent quarters, due to weak demand from large customers and its significant reliance on hardware sales, its increasing focus on the cloud computing market should help the stock. The stock is down 2.5% year to date.
[ Updated 11/24/2020] Is it A Good Time To Double Down On Value Tech Stocks?
Value Tech Stocks such as Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) have had a mixed year. There was good reason for this, as the deep Covid-19 recession, abundant liquidity following interest rate cuts, and the growing at-home economy drove investors to hyper-growth software as service stocks, high-risk, high reward sectors such as electric vehicles, and fast-growing platform players such as Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).
However, with the availability of multiple highly effective Covid-19 vaccines (Pfizer, Moderna, and AstraZeneca have published strong efficacy data on their vaccines) looking likely in 2021, things are likely to gradually start returning to normal. Moreover, the Fed could also eventually revisit its stance on ultra-low interest rates as the economy shows signs of picking up.  As this plays out investors could re-visit lower growth stocks that represent compelling value. While positive news about the vaccine earlier this month has already buoyed cyclical sectors such as energy, industrials, and financials we think it’s likely that funds will flow to value tech stocks in the near-to-medium term.
Our indicative theme of Value Tech Stocks includes relatively mature businesses that offer essential technology products and services and trade at reasonable valuations. Specifically, we have picked companies that are trading at a trailing price to earnings multiple of under 18x and have a market capitalization of over $10 billion. Key names in the theme include Oracle (ORCL) , VMware Inc (VMW), Seagate Technology (STX), Cisco (CSCO), and Intel (INTC).
[Updated 11/10/2020] Can Intel Stock Recover?
Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) stock has had a rough year, driven by delays in the company’s transition to the next generation 7-nano meter technology for its chips, some recent headwinds at its cloud and data center business, and strong competition from rival AMD in the PC and server CPU space. The stock is down by about 25% this year, significantly underperforming the NASDAQ which is up by over 28%. That said, there have been some positive developments that could help the company get back on track. In October, Intel announced a deal to sell its NAND business to SK Hynix for about $9 billion in a move that could allow the company to focus on its core CPU business, while bolstering its liquidity. Intel also appears to be more flexible with its manufacturing, recently noting that it could produce its next-gen chips in-house, or outsource them, or even use a hybrid model that leverages both internal and external fabs. Intel stock looks like good value at the moment, trading at just about 9.5x projected 2020 earnings. While growth could remain tepid in the near-term, Intel’s scale, its vast marketing and distribution footprint, and its large base of corporate customers, who rely on Intel processors and are likely averse to switching, should help the company in the medium to long-term.
See our indicative theme on Value Tech Stocks for a complete list of technology companies – including Intel, NetApp, and Oracle – that look like good value at the moment. The theme has underperformed this year, remaining roughly flat year-to-date, versus the S&P 500 which is up by about 10%.
[Updated 9/3/2020] Value Tech Stocks
While high-growth information technology stocks have rallied sharply this year, with valuations looking increasingly stretched, we’ve picked a few stocks including Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), and NetApp (NASDAQ:NTAP) that have relatively stable and mature businesses and still offer good value. Specifically, we have picked companies that are trading at a trailing price to earnings multiple of under 18x and have a market capitalization of over $10 billion. See our analysis Value Tech Stocks for more details on the returns and performance of these stocks. Parts of the analysis are summarized below.
Intel ($215 billion market cap, -15% YTD), the largest CPU vendor has been somewhat out of favor with investors on account of increasing competition from lower-cost ARM-based chipsets and the company’s delay in its rollout of its next-generation 7nm CPUs. However, Intel looks like good value considering its large base of existing customers, who rely on Intel processors and are likely averse to switch and also due to its vast marketing and distribution footprint. The stock trades at about 11x 2019 earnings.
Cisco ($178 billion market cap, -10% YTD), one of the largest network equipment providers, has also underperformed the market as it has struggled with top-line and bottom-line growth. However, the increasing digitization caused by the Covid-19 pandemic could drive demand for connectivity, in turn improving sales of Cisco’s networking software, and products such as switches and routers. The stock trades at about 16x FY’19 earnings.
NetApp ($10 billion market cap, -25% YTD) is a company that sells hardware and software focused on data management. While the company has seen a mixed performance this year due to weak demand from large customers and its significant reliance on hardware sales, it is looking to double down on the cloud computing market. Last month, NetApp closed a deal to acquire Spot, a leader in compute management, and cost optimization for public clouds. The stock currently trades at about 13x last fiscal year earnings.

2021-07-23 00:00:00+00:00,"Intel, TI split leaves chip outlook in doubt",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intel-ti-split-leaves-chip-outlook-in-doubt-2021-07-23,,,"By contrast, Intel Corp INTC.O on Thursday raised its full-year forecast, with Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger saying it could take the chip industry two years to catch up with ""explosive demand"" and predicting that a boom in PC sales driven by pandemic work-from-home arrangements would carry through next year.
Analysts, however, saw the bump in Intel's outlook as driven by a strong, already-ended second quarter, and said that it pointed to a weaker final quarter of 2021. Investors agreed, knocking 3% off the company's shares.
Kinngai Chan, analyst at Summit Insights Group, simply did not believe Intel's predictions that the PC market will keep growing through next year.
""Most of the CEO's comments just don't make any sense,"" Chan said. ""We disagree with Intel's view that the PC (total addressable market) will grow year-over-year in 2022. We have seen inventory build-up for Chromebooks and gaming desktops already, and we believe supply will catch up to demand by early 4Q21 for PC notebooks as well.""
SQUEEZE TO LAST
Still, Intel's raised forecast chimes in with a bullish outlook given by its bigger foundry rival Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC) 2330.TW, which expects strong sales growth in the current quarter, boosted by solid demand from smartphones, high-performance PCs and autos.
Auto industry executives also continue to suggest that the squeeze in semiconductor supply, also spurred by a boom in car sales this year, will stretch into next year.
Other economists and industry executives agree, and say that even if the shortage for car producers abates, other manufacturers will suffer.
For now, investors likely need to wait until next week for more clarity, with AMD, Qualcomm Inc QCOM.O, Samsung Electronics 005930.KS and SK Hynix 000660.KS all reporting results.
Combined with Intel, AMD's results should give a comprehensive view of the PC and data center markets when the company updates its outlook for the full year.
Qualcomm traditionally only forecasts one quarter in advance, but the company's dominant position in mobile phones means that investors often read its third-quarter forecast as a proxy for fall smartphone launches, including Apple Inc's AAPL.O closely watched iPhone.

Pat Gelsinger -- Chief Executive Officer
Thank you, Tony. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining our second-quarterearnings call It's a thrilling time for both the semiconductor industry and for Intel.
We're seeing unprecedented demand as the digitization of everything is accelerated by the superpowers of AI, pervasive connectivity, cloud-to-edge infrastructure and, increasingly, ubiquitous compute. Our breadth and depth of software, silicon and platforms and packaging and process, combined with our at-scale manufacturing, uniquely positions Intel to capitalize on this vast growth opportunity. Our Q2 results, which exceeded our top- and bottom-line expectations, reflect the strength of the industry, the demand for our products, as well as the superb execution of our factory network. As I've said before, we are only in the early innings of what is likely to be a decade of sustained growth across the industry.
Our momentum is building as we once again beat expectations and raised our full-year revenue and EPS guidance. Since laying out our IDM 2.0 strategy in March, we feel increasingly confident that we're moving the company forward toward our goal of delivering leadership products in every category in which we compete. While we have work to do, we are making strides to renew our execution machine. Seven-nanometer is progressing very well.
We've launched new innovative products, established Intel foundry services and made operational and organizational changes to lay the foundation needed to win in the next phase of our company's great history. Here at Intel, we're proud of our past, pragmatic about the work ahead but, most importantly, confident in our future. Now let me share some more detail on what we are seeing in the market. As compute is becoming more ubiquitous, we're seeing sustained strength in client demand.
The ecosystem is back to shipping over 1 million PC units a day despite grappling with component shortages. I expect PC TAM growth will continue in 2022 and beyond driven by three factors. First, PC density or PCs per household is increasing as COVID has irreversibly changed the way we work, learn, connect and care for each other. For example, even as we emerge from COVID, we're seeing many companies opt for hybrid work models versus full return to the office.
Second, replacement cycles are shortening on the larger and aging installed base. The shift to notebooks, the deployment of new operating systems and new better experiences, such as our Evo platform, will continue to drive refresh on the 400 million PCs over four years old that are running Windows 10. Finally, new markets and users are adopting the PC as the device of choice, and penetration rates are increasing as worldwide GDP growth makes the PC more affordable to more people. In areas like education, we see huge potential as the number of PCs per 100 students and teachers remains in the single digits.
These trends underpin my belief that we are still in the early stages of a sustainable cycle of PC growth, and our OEM and channel partners have resoundingly affirmed this perspective. Beyond client, we are seeing near-term recovery across traditional data center market, as well as explosive long-term demand from the cloud to the intelligent edge. Our digital society is creating data at an unspeakable pace, and AI is the key to unlocking the value from this data and turning it into information. As the appetite for meaningful data grows and the cost of compute falls, AI workloads are proliferating into more areas.
And as a result, we expect the AI market to grow at more than 20% a year. This is why we are infusing AI across everything we do. Similar revolutions are occurring in the areas of connectivity where the data center will be transformed by silicon photonics and 5G, which is hitting its stride with open RAN, and in autonomous driving, all markets in which we have substantial leadership positions. On the other side of the equation, the strong demand environment continues to stress the supply chain.
While I expect the shortages to bottom out in the second half, it will take another one to two years before the industry is able to completely catch up with demand. IDM 2.0, which combines our internal manufacturing capacity with the use of third-party foundries, best positions us to weather these challenges and work with our ecosystem partners to build a more resilient supply chain. With major fab construction projects underway in Oregon, Arizona, Ireland and Israel, we are investing for the future. But we are also taking action today to find innovative ways to help mitigate industry constraints.
For example, on our Q1 call, I talked about using our internal assembly test network to help with portions of the substrate manufacturing process, a benefit uniquely enabled by our IDM 2.0 strategy. I am pleased to say that this effort is now online and is significantly accelerating the availability of millions of substrates for our products. We are also working to build the EUV ecosystem, which require significant support around the equipment, including photoresist, mass generation and metrology. A great example is IMS Nanofabrication, a wholly owned subsidiary of Intel.
Using a novel multi-beam technology, IMS provides the large majority of EUV mask writing tools to the industry, and we plan to accelerate investments to advance this pivotal ecosystem capability. In the second quarter, we continued to see Intel Foundry Services build momentum. We are now engaged with more than 100 potential customers on the basis of our three key value propositions. First, IFS will have the widest offering of IP ranging from x86 to ARM to RISC-V, which allows our customers the flexibility to design products using our IP catalog, as well as their own.
Second, we will offer our customers comprehensive access to a range of mature and leading-edge process and packaging capabilities. I am pleased to announce we recently signed our first major cloud customer to use IFS packaging solutions. I'll have even more news to share on IFS customer momentum on Monday. Third, IFS will offer scale manufacturing that gives our customers confidence we can meet their demand.
As part of that, we are committed to creating a more robust, geographically balanced and secure supply chain. Along with our $20 billion fab investment in Arizona and $3.5 billion advanced packaging investment in New Mexico, we plan to build additional capacity to support both internal and IFS growth. The U.S. Innovation and Competition Act is a tremendous step forward to catalyze investments in manufacturing here in the U.S.
and will serve as a tailwind to our IFS efforts. After my recent visit to Europe, we are seeing similar enthusiasm from EU governments, customers and overall ecosystem. And we expect to announce our plans for our next U.S. and European sites by the end of this year.
Moving to our continued focus on execution. As I said at the start of the call, we are pragmatic about the work in front of us but supremely confident of our future. Under IDM 2.0, our factory network continues to deliver, and we are now manufacturing more 10-nanometer wafers than 14-nanometer. As 10-nanometer volumes ramp, economics are improving, with 10-nanometer wafer cost 45% lower year over year with more to come.
We will talk more about our plans for process and packaging leadership in our Intel accelerated event this Monday. I hope you will join me for the critical update. On our path back to unquestioned product leadership, customers continue to choose Intel. Using our broad portfolio of assets, we will continue to compete aggressively for market segment share.
In Q1, we gained PC share with record notebook sales, following that with record Q2 revenue. We launched 12 new processors, and Tiger Lake is ramping even better than expected with more than 50 million units shipped to date. Finally, our future client road map remains strong, and we expect to ship several million units of Alder Lake to customers in the second half. And Meteor Lake remains on track for production in 2023.
Beyond the CPU, we reached a major milestone with our partners at Microsoft with the announcement of Windows 11. We deepened our co-engineering efforts to enable new experiences, including running Android applications seamlessly on PCs and optimized for Intel-based platforms. We're gaining similar momentum through the year in the data center. Q1 was the low point in revenue for the year, and we exceeded our plan in Q2.
We expect DCG to grow sequentially, achieving double-digit year-on-year growth in the second half as it accelerates through the year. Ice Lake is ramping broadly to customers, including Microsoft, Alibaba, Baidu, Oracle and other major service providers and enterprise customers. Additionally, we continue to extend our leadership in networking by delivering a truly cloud agnostic platform using Xeon scalable processors and accelerators in partnership with Ericsson. This will allow operators like Verizon to introduce a virtualized RAN solution across all deployment scenarios, including existing footprints.
Finally, Mobileye further solidified its position as the leading supplier of advanced driver assistance platforms. In Q2, we announced a major win with Toyota and closed 10 additional design wins for over 16 million total lifetime units. Earlier this week, we had another exciting milestone as Mobileye became the first industry player to start testing autonomous vehicles in New York City, a challenging driving environment for humans, let alone AVs. With vehicles in Israel, Germany, Detroit, Tokyo, Shanghai and coming soon to Paris, Mobileye has the largest global footprint in the AV industry, enabled by our unique REM distributed mapping technology.
By year-end, we will have over 1 million vehicles providing telemetry for dynamic crowdsourced mapping, a unique and powerful advantage of Mobileye. At Intel, we have a saying, ""We begin with sand and the rest is our people."" At no other point in our history have our people and culture been more important to our success. We've recently made strategic organizational changes to further strengthen our technology leadership and accelerate our execution. We have restructured our data platform group into two business units: the data center and AI group led by Sandra Rivera, an Intel veteran with deep knowledge of data center silicon and software; and the network and edge group, which will be led by Nick McKeown, a renowned leader in the networking industry.
We have also created the accelerated computing systems and graphics group led by Raja Koduri, to increase the company's focus in key growth areas of high-performance computing and graphics. We're also highly encouraged to have Shlomit Weiss rejoin to strengthen our design engineering core. Finally, Greg Lavender, who joins as Intel CTO and GM of our software and advanced technology group, will drive a unified vision for our software strategy across Intel and ensure it remains a competitive differentiator for us. I have the utmost confidence in our leadership team to drive the future of Intel.
Together, we will continue to sharpen our focus on execution, accelerate innovation and unleash the talent inside Intel. While there is more work ahead, we are moving at a torrid pace, and I look forward to providing several updates in the coming months. On Monday, I invite you to attend Intel accelerated where we will lay out our road map to regain process performance leadership and share what comes next for our world-class packaging technologies. In October, we will hold our Intel innovation event, a geek fest for the industry to come together and explore the technology that will drive the next decade and beyond.
Finally, at our investor day on November 18, we'll pull it all together and present a compelling long-term business plan to drive sustained growth and shareholder value creation. As you can see, we have a lot planned for the rest of the year. But for now, I'll turn it over to George to discuss our Q2 performance and outlook.
George Davis -- Chief Financial Officer
Thanks, Pat, and good afternoon, everyone. As Pat said, we had a very strong Q2 and are raising full-year revenue guidance by $1 billion despite a highly constrained supply environment. Q2 revenue was $18.5 billion, exceeding our guidance by $700 million. This upside was led by continued strength in our PC business and earlier-than-expected recovery in both our IOTG business and the enterprise portion of the data center segment.
The PC and Mobileye businesses both achieved record Q2 revenue. Gross margin for the quarter was 59.2%, exceeding guide by 220 basis points, primarily due to improved mix and strong flow-through on higher revenue. Q2 EPS was $1.28, up $0.23 versus guide, largely on strong operational performance across the board. In Q2, we generated $8.7 billion of cash from operations, free cash flow of $5.1 billion and paid dividends of $1.4 billion.
Moving to segment performance in the quarter. CCG revenue was $10.1 billion, up 6% year over year. The growth of our core client business is up 14% when we exclude the impact of the ramping-down Apple modem business and the exit of our home gateway business. This shows the strong underlying growth in our client business despite a supply constrained environment.
Platform ASPs in client were up 4% sequentially on richer mix within notebook and increased desktop volume. On a year-over-year basis, the strength in consumer entry and education led to lower overall ASPs. Operating income was $3.8 billion, up 32% year over year on higher revenue, lower inventory reserves and reduced 10-nanometer cost. DCG revenue was $6.5 billion, exceeding our expectations, but down 9% year over year versus a challenging compare and a continued competitive environment.
Sequentially, DCG grew 16%, with all segments growing quarter over quarter and enterprise returning to year-over-year growth. Operating income was $1.9 billion, down 37% year over year, primarily on lower revenue, the 10-nanometer production ramp and increased R&D investment. IOTG revenue was $984 million, up 47% year over year on a broad-based recovery from COVID-driven lows and up 8% quarter over quarter led by strength in the retail segment. Operating margin was $287 million, up 310% year over year, returning to pre-COVID levels of profitability.
Mobileye revenue was $327 million, up 124% year over year but down sequentially due to COVID-related slowdowns at automotive OEMs. Operating margin was $109 million. Mobileye continues to execute extremely well, and we are seeing continued design win momentum. PSG revenue was $486 million, down 3% year over year due to significant supply constraints.
Demand continues to significantly exceed supply for FPGAs. Operating margin was $82 million, up 3% year over year. Moving to our Q3 and full-year outlook. For Q3, we are guiding revenue of $18.2 billion, up 5.4% year over year.
We remain in a highly constrained environment where we are unable to fully supply customer demand. In CCG, we continue to see very strong demand for our client products and expect TAM growth to continue. However, persistent industrywide component and substrate shortages are expected to lower CCG revenue sequentially. We expect supply shortages to continue for several quarters but appear to be particularly acute for client in Q3.
In data center, we expect enterprise and government and cloud to show further recovery in Q3. As a result, we expect to see strong year-over-year growth in the quarter. Sequentially, we are expecting modest growth that is expected to accelerate further in Q4. Gross margin is expected to be approximately 55%, down approximately 150 basis points year over year as seven-nanometer gains momentum and the Meteor Lake pilot line ramps.
We are also seeing pre-PRQ reserves on our Alder Lake product. We are forecasting EPS of $1.10 per share and a tax rate of approximately 4%. The forecast includes approximately $0.10 of onetime tax benefit from our onshoring of certain entities as part of our long-term tax planning. Turning to our full-year outlook.
We are raising our revenue guidance by $1 billion to $73.5 billion with gross margin of 56.5% and EPS of $4.80, up $0.20 from our prior guide. Consistent with the investment mode we are in under IDM 2.0, we expect capex of $19 billion to $20 billion this year and free cash flow to be $11 billion, up $500 million versus prior expectations. In our CCG business, we expect full-year revenue to be flat to slightly down year over year as growth from an increasing TAM is offset by supply constraints and the ramp down of our Apple modem and CPU revenue and the exit of our home gateway business. Adjusting for all of the Apple and home gateway business, CCG would have been up high single digits year over year.
For DCG, we expect full-year revenue to be slightly down year over year but with second-half revenue significantly higher than first half as E&G and cloud recovers. As a result, we expect data center will return to year-over-year growth in both Q3 and Q4. Gross margin percent is expected to be lower in the second half of the year, predominantly due to seven-nanometer factory ramp, worsening supply constraints impacting client volume and mix and a onetime charge in Q4 related to our Intel federal business. For your models, absent this onetime charge, the implied Q4 gross margin would be approximately flat to Q3.
It is good to remember that our investment in seven-nanometer represents a normal impact to introducing new process technologies. Since April, we have seen supply chain inflation happening faster than we are electing to pass-through to our customers, further impacting our second-half gross margin outlook. We expect increased R&D through the year as we invest in our road map and IDM 2.0 strategy, resulting in year-over-year growth in opex of approximately 10%. With that, let me turn it back over to Tony and get to your questions.
Tony Balow -- Head of Investor Relations
All right. Thank you, George. Moving on now to the Q&A. As is our normal practice, we would ask each participant to ask just one question.
Operator, please go ahead and introduce our first caller.
Questions & Answers:

Operator
Certainly. Our first question comes from the line of Tim Arcuri from UBS. Your question please.
Tim Arcuri -- UBS -- Analyst
Hi, thanks. Pat, there were some headlines recently about you potentially looking at maybe building out your foundry business by M&A. And I'm wondering, can you just comment? Broadly, do you think that M&A would significantly accelerate your foundry efforts? I know, right now, you're basically offering the 22-nanometer process, and you probably have to offer more processes to sort of pull those efforts forward. So I'm wondering if you can comment on the headlines that were out there.
Thanks.
Pat Gelsinger -- Chief Executive Officer
Hey, thanks for the question, Tim, and great to be with you all today. So first, I'd say, obviously, we can't comment specifically on the speculation that you've been hearing but feel well to say we are very happy with the build-out of the IFS business. As you say, it will include mature nodes, our 22FFL. It will also include our leading-edge nodes, as well our packaging offerings.
Overall, we're just seeing great momentum over 100 customers in our pipeline, and we fully expect that this is gonna be a great business for us. At this point, we would not say that M&A is critical but nor would we rule it out. Our view is that industry consolidation is very likely. The intense R&D, the need to move to modern and leading-edge nodes, the massive capital investments required, we just simply view that smaller players simply won't be able to keep up, and foundries without leading edge capabilities will be left behind.
And we're continually seeking ways to accelerate our plans with IFS. If an acquisition can help, we will certainly not rule it out.
Tim Arcuri -- UBS -- Analyst

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse from Evercore. Your question, please.
C.J. Muse -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst
Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. Just wanted to clarify, George, the onetime charge in Q4, roughly $300 million, can you give a little more color on that? And then, I guess, Pat or George, a bigger picture question. As you're going through this transformation IDM 2.0 strategy, is there a free cash flow target that you have in your mind in the coming one or two years or no? Thank you.
George Davis -- Chief Financial Officer
Yeah, let me -- I'll start with the onetime charge. Without going into too much detail, it is related to our high-performance compute activities through our Intel federal. It's crystallized in Q4 at the time that we execute a contract. So that's the reason for the timing.
Pat Gelsinger -- Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, and I would just say the HPC business for us, consistent with the reorg that we just announced, C.J., we just see a huge opportunity for us. As we start delivering our GPU, HPC specialized versions of the Xeon product, we see a great opportunity. The reorg brings more focus on this business. So even though there's a onetime charge in Q4, we see this as a great business for us for the long term and one that just will bring many, many technological market and business benefits.
So George, I'll let you answer the second half.
George Davis -- Chief Financial Officer
In terms of free cash flow, obviously, very important. We're focused on that. We raised it this year, as you saw on the call. We will go through not only free cash flow but capital and all of the normal key financial metrics for the company at the November analyst meeting.
So we'll defer until that time on that question, but thanks.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Pitzer from Credit Suisse. Your question, please.
John Pitzer -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst
Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for letting me ask the question. Pat, I wanted to ask a bigger picture question just on pricing in the quarter and your philosophy around pricing. It sounds like within the client business, mix explains a lot of the decline in ASPs year over year.
But when I look at the data center group, especially with enterprise up and calms down year over year, I was a little bit surprised to see ASPs in that group down about 7% year over year. Can you help us understand what's mix versus like-for-like? And as you think about regaining product dominance, how do you use pricing to kind of maintain a share as you get sort of your feet back underneath you?
Pat Gelsinger -- Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. And broadly speaking -- my comments will be a little bit specific, to start with, on the data center business proper. Data center business, good, good recovery in Q2. And with that, there was some ASP decline, some of that's competitive driven.
A little bit of that is mix driven but a bit more competitive. Our outlook there is that we see fairly stable pricing and market segment share in the data center business for the second half of the year. And that's driven by, I'll just say, we are bringing everything we got to the table to continue to win back the market and, with that, our software resources, our deep investments with our customers, the increasing strength of our product line. I'd also highlight that we have a very strong ramp for the Ice Lake product, which is very competitive, a clear leadership on a number of metrics, the critical ones such as AI performance.
And we're also starting to see the return to growth in cloud, as you note, but stronger growth in the enterprise portion of the market. So overall, DCG, good growth second half over first half. We'll be very competitive with that business. But it's a supply constrained environment overall, which is the similar case for the client business.
So overall, we don't see a lot of movement on ASP first half to second half in either of those businesses. It really is about supply limitations. And as George commented, we are not passing through all of our supply constraint, price increases that we're seeing, from our supply chain. We really see as an opportunity to be investing with our customers, rebuilding their confidence and partnership for the future.
And we're feeling very good about our overall strength, momentum and competitiveness as we go into the second half.
George Davis -- Chief Financial Officer
Yes. And C.J., I would just add, the Q2 number, which looks like a double-digit ASP decrease for CCG, I would just remind you that that's a year-over-year comparison where we have a much bigger mix of the small core products, which is really driving that. You saw units were up 33%, and ASPs were down 15%. It's really the mix that is reflected there.
John Pitzer -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research. Your question, please.
Stacy Rasgon -- Bernstein Research -- Analyst
Hi, guys, thanks for taking my questions. I had a question on depreciation. It's been coming down sequentially for the last several quarters. It was actually down again sequentially this quarter.
How is that possible given the capex ramp? Like, what's going on there? And how do we think about depreciation's impact on gross margin going forward given it's sort of run rating under $10 billion annually and your capex is now going to $20 billion annually? Like, how do I think about those?
George Davis -- Chief Financial Officer
Yeah, Stacy, so the absolute numbers are down -- or trending sort of counterintuitively. And really, it's NAND moving from non-GAAP into GAAP. There's no depreciation for the NAND business anymore under the accounting once it's held for sale. So it's an anomaly.
Yes, we expect depreciation to increase as we're ramping capex over the next several years. And again, in terms of how all of that translates into everything, from gross margins to free cash flow, we'll cover all that at the analyst day. But you're not missing anything.
Stacy Rasgon -- Bernstein Research -- Analyst
Got it. Thank you.
George Davis -- Chief Financial Officer
You bet.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley. Your question, please.
Joe Moore -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst
Great, thank you. I wonder if you could address the timing on Sapphire Rapids. There were some stuff on your blog. Kind of end of June, there was a delay.
It doesn't sound like, from customers, there's been that much of a change. But just maybe from your standpoint, how should we think about the timing of that product and how it affects you over the next 12 months?
Pat Gelsinger -- Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, thanks, Joe. I'll take that one. And overall, as I said, the data center business, strong momentum. And we really felt Q1 as the low point, Q2 gaining momentum second half, Ice Lake ramp being very strong.
And obviously, customers are now very anxious and excited about Sapphire Rapids, huge performance improvements but also a huge feature capabilities as part of that. So we did add a bit more time for the validation cycle for it. We are now deep into the validation. It's in the hands of customers with volume sampling underway, and they're quite excited about not just the performance capabilities, core count increases, but a lot of the new technologies in the area of new memory capabilities, new PCI Gen 5 capabilities, many of the new features that we brought in here for AI performance in particular.
So overall, it's gonna be a great product, and we are expecting to see a very strong ramp of it in the first half of next year. And this, we think, will just continue to build the momentum of the data center business. As we've indicated, a strong second half as forecast, and we're going to build on that as we go into next year with Sapphire Rapids. And the overall road map execution is improving as we look for '23 and '24 to deliver unquestioned leadership products across everything that we do, including the data center.
Joe Moore -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya from Bank of America. Your question, please.
Vivek Arya -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst
Thanks for taking my question. Pat, one more on the foundry business. So we have heard Intel commit, I think, $20 billion to U.S. foundry over the next several years and another $20 billion to foundry operations in Europe.
I'm curious when that spending is going to start. And importantly, who are the target customers? Because when I look at the fabless landscape, it's not the cloud vendors who are the large fabless customers, right? It's Apple. It's Qualcomm. It's NVIDIA, Marvell, AMD, etc.
And many of them compete against Intel. So I'm curious who are the target customers here that can justify this nearly $40 billion of spending that Intel is committing to from a foundry perspective? Thank you.
George Davis -- Chief Financial Officer
Yeah, Vivek, this is George. A couple of things, number one, we are short of supply. So we're the first big customer going into that expanded capacity. And we'll open up those facilities.
Getting the shelves and, what I would call, the lower cost elements in place is something that, quite frankly, we've fallen behind on over the last few years. So this is -- we're playing a little catch-up just for our own requirements. With foundry, we'll be talking about some potential customers. We've talked about 100 customers that are talking to us about foundry opportunities.
Obviously, when you bring on a new foundry customer, as you look at the lead times that are needed for that and the lead times that are needed to actually do the most expensive part of adding to your capacity, those things actually line up pretty well. So we'll manage that quite tightly. We'll go into this in more detail in November. But it's not a -- this is not intended to be we'll just keep building and hoping that somebody shows up.
It's gonna be tied to the demand signals that we are receiving not only for us, which are significantly in excess of our capacity today, but also for the customers we're working with, which I believe we'll be talking about more next week at our event.
Pat Gelsinger -- Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. And just to add, Vivek, we'll cover some more of this on Monday in our Intel accelerated event. And as part of that, we'll be laying out more specifics on the road map, the process, the packaging. But I'll say -- so the core of your question was who's gonna be the customers for this.
We expect a broad range of customers. We're going to have a range of offerings on the menu, if you could, for modern nodes, as well as leading edge nodes. We expect a range of customers across different segments of the marketplace, including some of the largest users of wafer capacity in the industry. There's a lot of excitement in the marketplace, 100-plus customers in the pipeline already, and you can expect to see great things in this area of a new and exciting business.
The world needs more semiconductors. The world needs a more balanced geographic supply chain for those semiconductors. And we're finding enormous momentum and enthusiasm for that, strong support from the customers, the ecosystem, as well as the governments around the world.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt Ramsay from Cowen. Your question, please.
Matt Ramsay -- Cowen and Company -- Analyst
Good afternoon, thank you very much. Pat, I was really pleased to see you guys announce that Greg was going to come join you as CTO. I don't know how many of the semiconductor folks are familiar with his background. Maybe you could just talk a little bit about what, as CTO, is gonna be under Greg's remit.
I know you guys have had this One API software strategy for a while that looks great in slides and on paper, but we've not seen a ton from it. So if you could expand a little bit about what's exactly gonna be under Greg's remit and what he's gonna be charged with, that would be really helpful. Thanks.
Pat Gelsinger -- Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, thank you, Matt. And Greg will be CTO, the company's CTO. So as part of that remit will be all of our labs, advanced research capabilities. We have a pool of hundreds of PhDs doing advanced research and some of the most leading edge work is done.
And as you probably know about Greg as well, he was a UT professor and was my CTO at VMware. He will also be the leader of all of our central software activities. This is a large organization. It's BIOS, drivers, compilers, all of those core things and the One API initiative, which we are now starting to see major partners come and align with us around One API.
The third and maybe most important area under his remit will be standardizing the upper layers of the software stack for us and, in particular, the AI software offerings for us. And this is an area that we have, I'll say, not managed well. We've had too many pieces and different portions of the organization, so he will become the AI software leader at scale for us in an area that's gonna be critical to standardize, deliver and just deliver some of the world-leading research that we have in the area of our software remit for our AI product offerings overall. Super excited to have him on the team, a world-class technologist and software leader, combining with another world-class leader like Nick McKeown, a world-class leader like Shlomit Weiss coming back on the team for our engineering.
Talent flow was going out of the company. It is now coming back to the company, and we are excited about the leadership team that we are forming.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur from J.P. Morgan. Your question, please.
Harlan Sur -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst
Good afternoon, thanks for taking my question. On your data center business, good to see the sequential inflection in Q2. Looking into the second half and your guidance for Q3 and Q4, it looks like DCG is going to grow double digits percentage year over year in the second half, and then, that would imply that your data center business is growing double digits second half versus first half of this year. Is the math roughly correct? And in addition to cloud and hyperscale spending reacceleration and improving enterprise, does the team continue to see strength in service provider, as well as your customers continue to build out their 5G networks?
Pat Gelsinger -- Chief Executive Officer
Yes, yes and yes, to your question, Harlan, right? And we're really -- the first half, second half year over year, you got it, right? We're seeing the growth for it. And like we said, we saw the bottom in Q1, great Q2 momentum continuing into the second half and next year. And we saw strong growth in enterprise and government, recovery in cloud, and we're seeing growth in that area. But as you say -- I'll just say, we are so well-positioned on the edge and the 5G.
The open RAN, VRAN initiatives in the industry are now hitting stride. And I think I've only been on three major service provider calls this week on exactly that topic, right, where they're really starting to look at those deployments at scale for a standardized software-driven edge environment for their 5G networks. And I'd also say this is a victory for innovation. Just a year ago, we were very -- just three years ago, there was grave geopolitical concerns around 5G and would there ever be flexibility for how that would get deployed nationally.
Now everybody is aligning against the ORAN, VRAN initiatives as the way to do their 5G broad deployments. And the Intel platform sits in the center of those almost everywhere in the world. It really is a great success story for us and one that we think that we'll be harvesting for many, many years to come.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs. Your question, please.
Toshiya Hari -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst
Good afternoon. Thanks so much for taking the question. I had a multi-part question on gross margin. George, you talked about PRQ reserves related to Alder Lake being a headwind this quarter.
If you can quantify that for us, ballpark, that would be super helpful. And then, toward the end of your remarks, in terms of the second half outlook, in terms of gross margin, you talked about supply tightness driving a deterioration in CCG mix. I was a little surprised to hear that given how strong Chromebooks were in the first half. So if you can elaborate on that that would be super helpful as well.
Thank you.
George Davis -- Chief Financial Officer
Yeah, so in terms of -- if we're looking at the -- particularly, let's look at Q3 because that's where we discussed the Alder Lake pre-PRQ reserves. It's one of the two top movers. When you look at being down 400 basis points, certainly, it's not the majority, but it's a meaningful impact in the quarter. Seven-nanometer start-up costs ramping is the biggest impact far and away.
In terms of supply tightness, the challenge is -- part of what made Q2 so great was customers really challenged our sales teams and our factories to remix within a quarter to provide them with the components that they could then match with what their supply chain was providing them so they could get to market. And this was -- watching it was super impressive, a little bit scary at times. But the team did a fantastic job. So we did a really good job of eating up a lot of our substrates, some of which we thought we would have available to us in Q3.
So the supply impact is more of a volume impact. Customers are already starting to mix upwards. So that's usually a positive for gross margin. And if there's upside in the second half, it will come from both higher substrates and the ability and a higher mix.
And that could well be the case. We were cautious. Q3, we could see we had a real supply challenge. I mean, it's acute.
But Q4, we are doing everything we can to help our substrate suppliers increase supply, including finishing up some of their manufacturing in our own facilities, which is something we could do as an IDM. If we have more success than we can forecast today, maybe Q4 could be seen as conservative.

Srini Pajjuri -- SMBC Nikko SecuritiesAnalyst
Thank you. Just to follow up to the previous question, George. Could you give us some idea as we head into the next year, what are some of the puts and takes on the gross margin front? I'm just curious as to how long the seven-nanometer cost will persist and when do they peak out. And as we go into first half of next year, how should we think about the gross margins?
George Davis -- Chief Financial Officer
Yeah, so again, I'm going to defer any kind of forecasting of '22 and beyond. But as you know, the fact that we have the seven-nanometer start-up ramping is a good sign that we're getting close to being able to get products ramping. And that's what really drives down costs over time. I think Pat was talking about Q2 over Q2 of 47% reduction in wafer cost in 10-nanometer.
That's the kind of benefit you can get as you ramp into a process. So we'll lay out more of our thinking in that regard later.

Hi, good afternoon. Just a quick follow-up on the substrate commentary during the Q&A. Is this something that you believe can actually help you competitively as you ramp substrate manufacturing in-house, particularly if supply constraints continue in the first half of next year?
Pat Gelsinger -- Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, we do think it generally moderates market share movements in the industry, period. And if anything, we're able to use it as an advantage because we are able to pull some of those substrate steps. And just to be clear, we're still relying on our substrate network, but we're pulling some of the back-end processing into our own factories, which allows us to essentially get more out of the capacity that's available in the industry. And that's what's enabling us to, I'll say, continue to overachieve on the overall market share gains that we've been seeing.
This has been an important factor. We do have some factored into our second half. We do hope to continue to overachieve in that area. And if I'd say, why did we overachieve so much in Q2, the heroes for the quarter for us were our manufacturing and operations team.
They just did a superb job for us and really relying on them for the second half. And as George said, hey, if there's more opportunity for us to overachieve on the guide that we set for the second half, it's going to come at the hands of their ability to essentially create more out of nothing, find capacity in the industry, build it out. And we're doing quite well in this respect. But overall, it is a constrained environment.
And as a result, we and everybody else are trying to drive our factories harder, drive yields better and be able to improve the supply chain of the industry. And we are quite excited about the enthusiasm we see in this consistent strong demand signal as the world becomes more digital, and we're gonna be building our internal factories rapidly, our supply chains rapidly and working with our supply chain quite aggressively.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank. Your question, please.
Ross Seymore -- Deutsche Bank-- Analyst
Hi, guys, thanks for letting me ask a question. I wanted to turn to the profitability side of things and specifically on DCG and the operating margin there. It's great to see that it improved from first quarter to second quarter. And given the revenue trajectory, I would assume it would improve again in the back half of the year.
But kind of from trough to trough, 2018 digestion period to this most recent one, the operating margin is about 10 points lower, mid-20s roughly versus mid-30s prior. And I really wanted to understand why is it lower this time. And perhaps even much more importantly, going forward, is there anything structurally that is going to stop that from returning back to the 40% to 50% operating margin range you guys have historically driven? Competitive dynamics need to catch up on the manufacturing side, so you have headwinds there, people customizing more cloud competition internally. Any of those dynamics that would stop you from getting back to that range? Thanks.
George Davis -- Chief Financial Officer
Yeah, thanks. Maybe starting at the latter part of your question, there's no long-term reason why you could not see DCG return to more historical margins. What you're seeing today is a reflection of a couple of things. First off, year over year, you've got significant factory start-up costs embedded for them as you look at their operating margin.
I would say another thing that people maybe are overlooking is our opex investments. We have significantly increased the opex in key areas of the company, even as we've taken down about $2 billion of opex since 2018 on various portfolio actions. And the DCG and the Xeon product line is absolutely critical to the company. And so we have substantially increased opex within that as well.
So that's the second largest impact, and we're going to continue to do that for as long as it's needed. And as you know, ultimately, it is your product competitiveness that gives you more flexibility to drive up ASPs further from today and drive higher gross margins. But I think the early comparisons this year were just off of such a strong compare. I mean, the first half of last year was just super strong, high XCC count quarters in the first half of this year, although Q2, quite frankly, was a lot better than we thought, coming into it for DCG on strength in enterprise.
But the comparisons year over year were quite tough. As you noted, it's coming up. And yes, seven-nanometer start-up's got to be absorbed and higher opex. But I think as you see, our product portfolio continue to get stronger and stronger with Ice Lake and Sapphire Rapids and then, for the generations after that.
There's no reason why, over time, we don't get back to historic levels.
Pat Gelsinger -- Chief Executive Officer
And I'd also just add one small point that the IFS gives us the opportunity to co-engineer with our largest customers. And this, in fact, creates a unique competitive differentiation where our IP with their IP is creating products that are very uniquely beneficial to their TCO and very co-engineered, so very sticky for both of us. And the example customer that we said, very large cloud customers, one of our IFS early customers, is an example of that kind of co-engineering that we expect that we'll be doing at scale for that portion of the marketplace pretty uniquely.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ambrish Srivastava from BMO Capital Markets. Your question, please.
Ambrish Srivastava -- BMO Capital Markets -- Analyst
Thank you, Pat. I just wanted to get back to the competitive environment and just trying to connect all the dots. So in your slide deck for second quarter, you said that the ASPs were down and you referred to an increasingly competitive environment in servers. But in response to one of the questions earlier on, you said you expect a more stable share and pricing environment in DCG.
And then, the final thing that caught my attention was on the substrate side, you said you were kind of leveraging that back end to moderate market share. So is that true for the -- did I get that correct that the competitive environment will be stable versus what it was in the second quarter? And then, is the substrate also enabling -- your captive footprint in the back end is allowing you to probably stabilize share losses in the data center side as well. Thank you.
Pat Gelsinger -- Chief Executive Officer
The comment on fairly stable market segment share and ASP for DCG for the second half of the year is what our expectations are. So I'd just say, I think that the substrate and the overall supply limitations keeps, I'll say, a bound on market share movements in that area of the business overall. We do think incrementally, our IDM capabilities give us a bit more capacity, and we saw market share gains, for instance, in the first half of the year in the client business as a result of that. And we do think that gives us some ability to hopefully do a bit better than we've even guided with if it occurs.
But overall, yes, your question is in the right domain, fairly stable ASPs, fairly stable market segment share in the data center in the second half of the year, which, as we've already said, has substantially improved from last year, as well as from the first half of this year. Products are getting more competitive. Stronger products give us more ASP capabilities as they become more competitive. So overall, we're feeling like the bottom was Q1, Q2 showed that to be the case, even a bit above our expectations, and we're in a great trajectory for the second half and into next year.
Ambrish Srivastava -- BMO Capital Markets -- Analyst
Thank you.
Pat Gelsinger -- Chief Executive Officer
Thank you. Well, I think we'll wrap up at this point. And before we sign off, one last opportunity to say that it is an honor to be back for my dream job, to run this iconic company at this pivotal time in the history of the semiconductor industry. We're rebuilding our heritage of execution, innovation and growth.
Along with the 110,000 talented, passionate Intel employees, I am just absolutely confident that the best days for this company are ahead of us. Thanks for the call today. And I do look forward to talking to you all at our Intel accelerated event on Monday. Talk to you then.
Thank you so much.

Nanotechnology is not a novel concept. However, its application in a variety of areas is increasing at an exponential pace. That is why nanotech stocks are becoming the latest investment craze that is taking the markets by storm.
The stock market is keen to find the next biggest technology boom. So, it isn’t surprising nanotech stocks have gained steam in the last few months. Nanoscale opens up the prospects of new technologies and products because it operates on the atomic and molecular level.
But there is a bit of risk involved as well. Nanotechnology has its benefits, but it is relatively new. Plus, there is an argument we don’t fully understand the physical and chemical interactions that nanotechnology allows.

7 Undervalued Stocks to Buy Even as Markets Hit an All-Time High
Regardless, the following five nanotech stocks are moving ahead and focusing on this area. Any breakthroughs that occur will significantly change the Nanotech is already being actively used in the computers, microchips, chemicals, and devices we use each day. But there is room for further growth.
So, without further ado, let’s take a deep dive on these five companies:

International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM)
Veeco Instruments (NASDAQ:VECO)
Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM)
Nanotech Stocks to Buy: Applied Materials (AMAT)

Applied Materials manufactures engineered materials for chips and displays for global semiconductor, display, and related industries.
It is the world’s largest supplier of semiconductor manufacturing equipment. It is heavily involved in the microchip industry, driven by reducing sizes and applying films on an atom-by-atom basis.
The company, offers materials engineering solutions to manufacture approximately every chip in the world. Due to its prime position within the market, the company did very well last year. The bottom line and the top line jumped by 52.9% and 28.5%, respectively.
The markets have also taken notice and rewarded the company handsomely. AMAT has outperformed the S&P 500 by 82.7% and its sector by 78.0% in the past year.
With a current gross margin of 45.8% and a net margin of 22.4%, do not expect the momentum to let up anytime soon. Plus, the recent breakthrough by the company, called selective tungsten deposition, has the industry buzzing.
Its Endura Volta Selective Tungsten CVD system allows semiconductors to selectively deposit tungsten in the transistor contact vias to reduce their resistance and increase transistor’s performance and reduce power consumption. In simpler terms, it is 3D printing at the atomic scale.
 Intel (INTC)

Intel is the world’s largest chipmaker. The Silicon Valley-based tech giant designs and manufactures microprocessors for the global personal computer and data center markets.
Although it pioneered the x86 architecture for microprocessors, it has recently lost market share to Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD).
Nevertheless, despite falling behind in the chip processors race for personal computers, Intel still maintains a healthy position in the market and has diversified into several other business areas. One of these segments is nanotech.

The company aims to take care of every aspect enterprise IT needs, providing infrastructure services, software, IT services, and hardware. Much like any other tech giant, the company has refused to rest on its laurels.
Headquartered in Armonk, New York, with operations in over 170 countries, IBM has at least a two-decade history in nanotechnology research.
Its IBM Research division worked in tandem with Singapore’s Institute of Bioengineering and Nanotechnology to develop a synthetic polymer that may help increase the effectiveness of existing antibiotics.
This partnership has largely gone unnoticed by the markets. It’s easy for the company’s nanotech work to get lost in the shuffle, especially when IBM is aggressively working on other high-growth areas like hybrid cloud, AI and quantum computing.
IBM bulls are not concentrating on the nanotech segment as a significant growth area right now, but in time, it will become one.

Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM)

Founded in Taiwan in 1987 by Morris Chang, TSMC is the world’s largest semiconductor foundry.
Historically, chipmakers fabricated their own chips. Nowadays, foundries and architecture take care of chipmaking, and the chipmaker itself concentrates on engineering instead.
Hence, these “fabless” chip companies turn to Taiwan Semiconductor to demand new chips for phones, televisions, networks, gaming consoles, or server farms.
The U.S. depends heavily on the company’s chip-making technology and wants it to build more plants here. China, Germany, and Japan all want Taiwan Semiconductor fabs.
The foundry leader has an illustrious customer base, including Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Nvidia, and several other important names in the space.
TSM was the first foundry to manufacture 7-nanometer chip production in scale volumes. It has now perfected extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUL) techniques that will let it make chips with circuit lines just 2 nm apart secure its technology leadership.

NEW YORK, July 22 (Reuters) - Big tech helped Wall Street inch up to a higher close on Thursday, modestly building on a two-day rally as lackluster economic data and mixed corporate earnings prompted a pivot back to growth stocks.
A pull-back in economically sensitive cyclicals kept the S&P 500's and the blue-chip Dow's gains muted, while small-caps .RUT underperformed their larger rivals.
But megacap tech and tech-adjacent stocks, such as Microsoft Corp MSFT.O, Amazon.com AMZN.O, Apple Inc AAPL.O, Facebook Inc FB.O and Alphabet Inc GOOGL.O, rose ahead of their quarterly results next week, putting the Nasdaq out front.
All three major U.S. stock indexes ended the session within 1% of their record closing highs.
Growth stocks .IGX, which outperformed throughout the health crisis, were back in favor, gaining 0.8%, while the value index .IVX slipped by 0.5%.
""The market is flip-flopping between the view that economic growth has almost peaked so you need to buy stocks that manufacture their own growth like tech names, versus the view that economic growth will continue and you want to own cyclicals and value names,"" said David Carter, chief investment officer at Lenox Wealth Advisors in New York.
The number of U.S. workers filing first-time applications for unemployment benefits USJOB=ECI spiked unexpectedly to 419,000 last week, a two-month high, according to the Labor Department.
Market participants are closely watching labor market indicators for hints as to when the Federal Reserve, expected to convene next week for its two-day monetary policy meeting, will begin discussions about hiking key interest rates from near zero.
""The jobless data today didn’t have a meaningful impact on markets or the economic outlook,"" Carter added. ""It’s now all about how much longer the Fed will tolerate low rates. The Fed seems to be favoring its full employment mandate more than its price stability mandate.""
""Accordingly, the upcoming Fed meeting could be impactful,"" Carter said.
Benchmark Treasury yields eased after the bid at the largest-ever TIPS auction touched a record low, pressuring rate sensitive banks.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJIrose 25.35 points, or 0.07%, to 34,823.35, the S&P 500 .SPXgained 8.79 points, or 0.20%, to 4,367.48 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXICadded 52.64 points, or 0.36%, to 14,684.60.
Of the 11 major sectors of the S&P 500, tech .SPLRCT was shining brightest, gaining 0.7%. Energy stocks .SPNY suffered the largest percentage drop.
The second-quarter reporting season barreled ahead at full-throttle, with 104 of the companies in the S&P 500 having reported. Of those, 88% have beaten consensus estimates, according to Refinitiv.
Drugmaker Biogen Inc BIIB.O gained 1.1% after hiking its full-year revenue guidance, while Domino's Pizza Inc DPZ.N surged 14.6% to an all-time high on the heels of its quarterly report.
Southwest Airlines Co LUV.N posted a bigger-than-expected quarterly loss, sending its stock down 3.5%, and American Airlines Group Inc AAL.O dipped 1.1% even after reporting a quarterly profit.
The S&P 1500 Airlines index .SPCOMAIR ended the session off 1.7%.
Shares of Texas Instruments Inc TXN.O slid 5.3% after its current-quarter revenue forecast cast concerns as to whether the company will be able to meet spiking demand in the face of a global semiconductor shortage.
The Philadelphia SE Semiconductor index .SOX ended the session down 0.9%.
Chipmaker Intel Corp INTC.O slipped more than 1% in extended trading after the chipmaker posted results and raised its annual revenue forecast.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.82-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.90-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted 39 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 70 new highs and 54 new lows.
Volume on U.S. exchanges was 8.25 billion shares, compared with the 10.12 billion average over the last 20 trading days.

July 22 (Reuters) - Chipmaker Intel Corp INTC.O raised its annual revenue forecast on Thursday, focusing on its dual strategy of increasing in-house production as well as outsourcing to catch up with rivals.
Intel, one of the one of the few remaining companies in the processor chip industry that both designs and manufactures its own chips, has been able to weather the supply chain woes better.
Rivals such as Advanced Micro Devices Inc AMD.O that outsource production to foundries have been impacted more than Intel due to shortage of chip components and raw materials.
A shift in business working models toward cloud and artificial intelligence-based operations due to the pandemic has also increased demand for processors used in data centers and PCs.
Intel said it now expects annual adjusted revenue of $73.5 billion, compared with its previous forecast of $72.5 billion and analyst expectations of $72.80 billion, according to Refinitiv IBES data.
The company expects adjusted third-quarter revenue of about $18.2 billion, above estimates of $18.09 billion.

2021-07-22 00:00:00+00:00,September 3rd Options Now Available For Intel,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/september-3rd-options-now-available-for-intel-2021-07-22,,,"Investors in Intel Corp (Symbol: INTC) saw new options become available today, for the September 3rd expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the INTC options chain for the new September 3rd contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $55.00 strike price has a current bid of $2.03. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $55.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $52.97 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of INTC, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $55.83/share today.
Because the $55.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 100%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 3.69% return on the cash commitment, or 31.33% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Intel Corp, and highlighting in green where the $55.00 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $57.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.55. If an investor was to purchase shares of INTC stock at the current price level of $55.83/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $57.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 4.87% if the stock gets called away at the September 3rd expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if INTC shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Intel Corp, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing INTC's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $57.00 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $57.00 strike represents an approximate 2% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 2.78% boost of extra return to the investor, or 23.57% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.
Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $55.83) to be 38%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

NEW YORK, July 22 (Reuters) - U.S. stock markets closed higher after a mixed trading session as investors digested negative economic data reflecting the country's struggle to move past the COVID-19 pandemic, while yields on safe-haven assets such as U.S. Treasuries slipped.
All three major U.S. stock indexes ended in the green and within 1% of record closing highs, thanks in part to Big Tech. The Dow and S&P 500 fell earlier in the day on the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits. The dollar also rose after it slid earlier in the trading session.
""The overall picture continues to point to a return to a pre-pandemic level of economic activity,"" said Anu Gaggar, senior global investment analyst for Commonwealth Financial Network, in an e-mailed statement about the jobless claims and market impact.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 25.35 points, or 0.07%, to close at 34,823.35, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 8.79 points, or 0.20%, to end the day at 4,367.48 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 52.64 points, or 0.36%, to close at 14,684.60.
The dollar index, meanwhile, rose 0.1% to 92.852 =USD. The U.S. currency hit its highest level in more than three months on Wednesday.
Yields on U.S. Treasuries eased after the auction of $16 billion in 10-year TIPS was bid at a record low. The yield on 10-year Treasury notes US10YT=RR fell 2.2 basis points to 1.260%.
“We had a form of capitulation in the market, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday and Monday, but a sign of resilience occurred on Tuesday and Wednesday,” said Steve Goldman at Goldman Management. “That’s typically a favorable sign for a market not far from its high. That’s usually a hopeful sign. It tends to indicate that the selling pressure has subsided.”
“The jobless claims data that came out this morning was soft and continues to be stubbornly elevated,” said Sean Bandazian, investment analyst for Cornerstone Wealth. “The market is probably digesting some volatility from the last several days. We had a pretty sizable drawdown and then recovery making back 75% of what we lost Friday and Monday.”
Growth stocks were back in favor, closing up, while value stocks slipped. Earnings season marched on, with Intel Corp INTC.O falling in extended trade after posting results and Southwest Airlines Co LUV.N reporting a loss.
There were increases in filings for unemployment benefits in California, Illinois, Kentucky, Michigan, Missouri and Texas. Some of these states have experienced a surge in new coronavirus cases as the more contagious Delta variant spreads, while U.S. senators try to take aim at tech companies allowing misinformation about vaccines to spread.
