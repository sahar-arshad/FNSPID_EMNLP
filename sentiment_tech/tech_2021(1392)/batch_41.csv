2021-02-24 00:00:00+00:00,"Intel, Oracle And Cisco Stock: Will Tech's Old Guard Beat The Market In 2021?",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intel-oracle-and-cisco-stock%3A-will-techs-old-guard-beat-the-market-in-2021-2021-02-24,,,"Our theme of Value Tech Stocks has underperformed the market in recent years, rising by just about 29% since the end of 2017, compared to the S&P 500 which is up by about 46% over the same period. The theme includes tech companies that offer essential technology products and services, have a market capitalization of over $10 billion, and trade at a trailing price to earnings multiple of under 20x. In comparison, the broader NASDAQ index trades at a much higher 40x trailing P/E. However, we believe that the stocks in our theme have lower price risk in the current market environment, and at the same time could offer reasonable upside from increasing digitization and higher corporate IT spends following Covid-19. Below is a bit more about the stocks in the theme and some trends that could help to drive them higher in the near-term.
Intel stock (NASDAQ:INTC) stock has been the best performer within our theme this year so far, rising by about 26% since early January, driven by stronger than expected Q4 results and guidance for the current quarter, and also due to the appointment of new CEO Pat Gelsinger. Moreover, demand for semiconductors has been strong across the board, with many end-markets facing chip shortages. Intel, with its sizable production capacity, should stand to gain.
Cisco stock (NASDAQ:CSCO) stock is up by about 2% year-to-date. The company has been witnessing weaker demand for its networking gear as the Covid-19 pandemic caused customers to postpone deployments and also due to stronger competition. However, IT spending is expected to rebound sharply as the pandemic wanes and Cisco should be well poised to benefit. Additionally, Cisco’s pivot to a more software-centric model should also help the stock.
Oracle stock (NYSE:ORCL) stock is down by about -5.5% year-to-date. Although revenues have faced pressure in recent years as the hardware and services segments have taken a hit, the company’s cloud operations, particularly its public cloud business, could unlock a lot of value. During its most recent quarter, the company said that revenue from its Gen 2 cloud was up over 100% year-over-year. As the public cloud business continues to gain scale and the company provides more transparency, investors could potentially re-rate the stock higher.
[Updated 1/20/2021] Value Tech Stocks 
Our indicative theme of Value Tech Stocks includes relatively mature businesses that offer essential technology products and services and trade at reasonable valuations. Specifically, we have picked tech companies that are trading at a trailing price to earnings multiple of under 20x and have a market capitalization of over $10 billion. Although these stocks haven’t really rallied since our last update in November, with the Covid-19 vaccines roll out gathering steam globally, it’s likely only a matter of time before broader economic growth returns, helping value stocks, including reasonably priced technology names. Here’s a quick rundown of some value stocks in our Value tech stocks theme.
Intel (INTC) has been out of favor with investors due to increasing preference for lower-cost ARM-based chipsets and a delay in its rollout of its next-generation 7nm CPUs. However, the stock is up by about 16% year-to-date, as investors have a favorable view of Intel’s recently announced top management shakeup, which will see VMware CEO and former Intel CTO Pat Gelsinger succeed current Intel CEO, Bob Swan.
Cisco (CSCO) stock has also been listless as corporations paired back on spending on networking gear through the Covid-19 recession. However, IT spending is likely to rebound sharply over 2021 and Cisco being the go-to company for enterprise networking solutions should benefit. The company’s gradual pivoting to a more software-driven model should also help the stock. The stock is up by about 1.5% this year.
Oracle (ORCL) is a provider of database, cloud, and enterprise software products. The stock has seen steady growth over the last several years, driven by expanding earnings and its share repurchase program. The company has been expanding sales of its cloud-based applications, such as Fusion and enterprise resourcing planning services, helping to offset the slow growth of its legacy offerings. The stock is down by about -4.5% this year.
NetApp (NTAP) is a company that sells hardware and software focused on data management. While the company has seen a mixed performance in recent quarters, due to weak demand from large customers and its significant reliance on hardware sales, its increasing focus on the cloud computing market should help the stock. The stock is down 2.5% year to date.
[ Updated 11/24/2020] Is it A Good Time To Double Down On Value Tech Stocks?
Value Tech Stocks such as Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) have had a mixed year. There was good reason for this, as the deep Covid-19 recession, abundant liquidity following interest rate cuts, and the growing at-home economy drove investors to hyper-growth software as service stocks, high-risk, high reward sectors such as electric vehicles, and fast-growing platform players such as Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).
However, with the availability of multiple highly effective Covid-19 vaccines (Pfizer, Moderna, and AstraZeneca have published strong efficacy data on their vaccines) looking likely in 2021, things are likely to gradually start returning to normal. Moreover, the Fed could also eventually revisit its stance on ultra-low interest rates as the economy shows signs of picking up.  As this plays out investors could re-visit lower growth stocks that represent compelling value. While positive news about the vaccine earlier this month has already buoyed cyclical sectors such as energy, industrials, and financials we think it’s likely that funds will flow to value tech stocks in the near-to-medium term.
Our indicative theme of Value Tech Stocks includes relatively mature businesses that offer essential technology products and services and trade at reasonable valuations. Specifically, we have picked companies that are trading at a trailing price to earnings multiple of under 18x and have a market capitalization of over $10 billion. Key names in the theme include Oracle (ORCL) , VMware Inc (VMW), Seagate Technology (STX), Cisco (CSCO), and Intel (INTC).
[Updated 11/10/2020] Can Intel Stock Recover?
Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) stock has had a rough year, driven by delays in the company’s transition to the next generation 7-nano meter technology for its chips, some recent headwinds at its cloud and data center business, and strong competition from rival AMD in the PC and server CPU space. The stock is down by about 25% this year, significantly underperforming the NASDAQ which is up by over 28%. That said, there have been some positive developments that could help the company get back on track. In October, Intel announced a deal to sell its NAND business to SK Hynix for about $9 billion in a move that could allow the company to focus on its core CPU business, while bolstering its liquidity. Intel also appears to be more flexible with its manufacturing, recently noting that it could produce its next-gen chips in-house, or outsource them, or even use a hybrid model that leverages both internal and external fabs. Intel stock looks like good value at the moment, trading at just about 9.5x projected 2020 earnings. While growth could remain tepid in the near-term, Intel’s scale, its vast marketing and distribution footprint, and its large base of corporate customers, who rely on Intel processors and are likely averse to switching, should help the company in the medium to long-term.
See our indicative theme on Value Tech Stocks for a complete list of technology companies – including Intel, NetApp, and Oracle – that look like good value at the moment. The theme has underperformed this year, remaining roughly flat year-to-date, versus the S&P 500 which is up by about 10%.
[Updated 9/3/2020] Value Tech Stocks
While high-growth information technology stocks have rallied sharply this year, with valuations looking increasingly stretched, we’ve picked a few stocks including Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), and NetApp (NASDAQ:NTAP) that have relatively stable and mature businesses and still offer good value. Specifically, we have picked companies that are trading at a trailing price to earnings multiple of under 18x and have a market capitalization of over $10 billion. See our analysis Value Tech Stocks for more details on the returns and performance of these stocks. Parts of the analysis are summarized below.
Intel ($215 billion market cap, -15% YTD), the largest CPU vendor has been somewhat out of favor with investors on account of increasing competition from lower-cost ARM-based chipsets and the company’s delay in its rollout of its next-generation 7nm CPUs. However, Intel looks like good value considering its large base of existing customers, who rely on Intel processors and are likely averse to switch and also due to its vast marketing and distribution footprint. The stock trades at about 11x 2019 earnings.
Cisco ($178 billion market cap, -10% YTD), one of the largest network equipment providers, has also underperformed the market as it has struggled with top-line and bottom-line growth. However, the increasing digitization caused by the Covid-19 pandemic could drive demand for connectivity, in turn improving sales of Cisco’s networking software, and products such as switches and routers. The stock trades at about 16x FY’19 earnings.
NetApp ($10 billion market cap, -25% YTD) is a company that sells hardware and software focused on data management. While the company has seen a mixed performance this year due to weak demand from large customers and its significant reliance on hardware sales, it is looking to double down on the cloud computing market. Last month, NetApp closed a deal to acquire Spot, a leader in compute management, and cost optimization for public clouds. The stock currently trades at about 13x last fiscal year earnings.
While value tech stocks look attractive, 2020 has also created many pricing discontinuities which can offer attractive trading opportunities. For example, you’ll be surprised how the stock valuation for Apple vs. Logitech shows a disconnect with their relative operational growth. You can find many such discontinuous pairs here.

2021-02-23 00:00:00+00:00,Advanced Micro Devices Is Due for a Strong Comeback This Year and Beyond,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/advanced-micro-devices-is-due-for-a-strong-comeback-this-year-and-beyond-2021-02-23,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is a company that has been going from strength to strength in recent times. The company is the beneficiary of secular tailwinds such as “work from home” and the increased demand for gaming. However, the upward trajectory for AMD stock seems to have stalled. The stock seems to have difficulty getting past the $100 resistance level and has been consolidating from $74 to $94 since August.

I believe this consolidation is simply building momentum for AMD shares to head much higher. There has been an influx of good news lately such as blockbuster quarterly results, rave reviews for its flagship product and a game-changing acquisition.
With all of that in mind, let’s take a closer look at why AMD stock is due for a comeback.
Ryzen Success Will Continue to Power AMD Stock Higher
It wasn’t that long ago that AMD was playing second fiddle to Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) in the PC and laptop markets. AMD used to be the computer chip for cheap laptops, while the “Intel Inside” sticker was the symbol of quality. Times sure have changed since then.
Early this year, AMD finally overtook Intel in terms of market share in the desktop CPU for the first time in 15 years. According to PassMark Software’s Performance Test benchmarking tool, AMD has a 50.8% share of the Windows desktop CPU market compared to Intel’s 49.2%. This is mainly on the strength of the Ryzen series of CPUs. With the recently launched Ryzen 5000 series, AMD is poised to continue gaining market share. These products are so popular that the initial stock sold out within minutes.
The Ryzen series has been a massive success for AMD. The most advanced processor in Ryzen’s 4th generation is the Ryzen 9 5900X. This 12-core, 24-thread CPU has gotten rave reviews as it represents the largest generation-to-generation jump in performance in recent memory.
The new Ryzen performs well on both single-threaded and multi-threaded tasks. It also comes with the next generation of connection interface called PCle 4.0, a feature Intel has not yet implemented in its chips.
7 Safe Stocks to Buy for Your Retirement
Techradar.com summarizes the superior strength of this chip in the following way:
“Intel and AMD have been battling it out for dominance across multi- and single-threaded performance for years. There was this unspoken rule that if you want strong multi-threaded performance ideal for creative and professional applications, you go with AMD. If you want one for playing the best PC games, on the other hand, Intel would have the best processor.
Now, thanks to the AMD Ryzen 9 5900X, it looks like AMD is coming out the ultimate winner.”
AMD Continues Consolidation Despite Impressive Financial Results
AMD’s latest financial results are incredibly impressive with Q4 2020 revenue up 53% to $3.2 billion compared to the $2.1 billion reported at the same time last year. AMD’s full-year 2020 revenue was $9.76 billion — much higher than the $6.73 billion reported in 2019.
Due to the company’s scale and operating leverage, the revenue increases flowed straight to the bottom line. In other words, AMD’s revenues increased at a much higher rate than subsequent expenses. The chip maker’s net income for Q4 2020 jumped nearly 10x year over year to $1.78 billion from $170 million in Q4 2019. AMD’s full-year 2020 net income was $2.49 billion — an astonishing 630% leap over the previous year’s results.
The increase in PC demand due to the novel coronavirus pandemic played a large role in these impressive results. Demand for computers has skyrocketed as people and businesses were forced to purchase equipment to work from home. The increased popularity of gaming has also increased demand for AMD’s products as the lockdowns have limited people’s entertainment options.
However, I believe that these increases won’t just be short-term boosts in revenue. Rather, I think they’ll ultimately represent long-term secular headwinds. Gaming and working from home (or at least a hybrid model) will be here to stay. Furthermore, as the boundaries between work and home continue to blur, there could be a chance for AMD to grab more market share from Intel, especially in the laptop market.
We might see more office laptops with an AMD Ryzen sticker instead of the familiar “Intel Inside.”
The Bottom Line on AMD
AMD stock is one of the best stocks to buy to take advantage of many secular trends in the market today. The company is slowly but surely gaining market share from Intel and could be the dominant player in the near future. With its proposed acquisition of Xilinx (NASDAQ:XLNX), AMD further strengthens its data center products. Combining AMD’s CPU with Xilinx’s FPGA and ACAP capabilities could be game changing.
With all of these factors considered, I see the consolidation in AMD as an opportunity to buy.

2021-02-23 00:00:00+00:00,All 30 Dow Jones Stocks Ranked: The Pros Weigh In,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/all-30-dow-jones-stocks-ranked%3A-the-pros-weigh-in,,,"You can't beat Dow Jones stocks for stability and defense in a down market. 
Although the Dow Jones Industrial Average has by no means escaped 2022's widespread shellacking in equities, the blue-chip barometer is indeed holding up better than the other two major market benchmarks. 
The elite list of 30 large- and mega-cap stocks generated a total return (price plus dividends) of -5.3% for the year-to-date through April 12. The broader S&P 500's total return over the same span came to -7.4%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite delivered a total return of -14.4%.

Rising interest rates, the highest inflation readings in four decades, geopolitical jitters and COVID-19-related shutdowns in China have very much impaired the market's appetite for risk. That's where Dow Jones stocks come in.
This collection of industry-leading companies and dividend growth stalwarts with their battleship-like balance sheets can offer something of a safe harbor in tempestuous times. 
To get a sense of which Dow Jones stocks Wall Street recommends at this juncture in an uncommonly uncertain year, we screened the DJIA by analysts' consensus recommendations, from worst to first, using data from S&P Global Market Intelligence.
Here's how the ratings system works: S&P surveys analysts' stock calls and scores them on a five-point scale, where 1.0 equals a Strong Buy and 5.0 is a Strong Sell. Scores between 3.5 and 2.5 translate into Hold recommendations. Scores higher than 3.5 equate to Sell ratings, while scores equal to or below 2.5 mean that analysts, on average, rate shares at Buy. The closer a score gets to 1.0, the higher conviction the Buy recommendation.
Read on as we show you how industry analysts rate all 30 Dow Jones stocks, and what they have to say about their prospects for the 12 months ahead.

30. 3M
Market value: $84.6 billion
Dividend yield: 4.0%
Analysts' consensus recommendation: 3.19 (Hold)
Analysts became incrementally more bearish on 3M (MMM, $148.58) during the first quarter. Sadly, that helped the industrial conglomerate extend its unenviable reign as Wall Street's least favorite Dow stock.
Sluggish-to-stagnant revenue, margin and earnings growth has made MMM stock a long-time market laggard. Snarled supply chains, input cost inflation and the company's limited ability to raise its prices have only added to the Street's collective gloom.
Be that as it may, the materials stock's terrible start to 2022 did prompt at least one analyst to lift his recommendation on MMM in early March – albeit to Hold from Sell.
""Without much pricing power, we expect 3M to see material margin compression in 2022 amid high inflation, especially with the manufacturer being a large consumer of oil, natural gas, and refined oil and gas products,"" says CFRA Research analyst Colin Scarola.
However, with 3M shares having declined as much as 21% for the year-to-date through March 11, they're ""much closer to fair value in a high inflation and energy cost environment,"" the analyst says. ""Accordingly, we lift our rating.""
Scarola has plenty of company among his peers. Of the 21 analysts issuing opinions on MMM stock who are tracked by S&P Global Market Intelligence, two have it at Strong Buy, one says Buy and 12 call it a Hold. Sell calls are rare on the Street, so it's notable that three analysts rate 3M at Sell and three say Strong Sell.

29. Walgreens Boots Alliance
Market value: $38.2 billion
Dividend yield: 4.3%
Analysts' consensus recommendation: 3.15 (Hold)
The Street hasn't budged from its consensus Hold recommendation on Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA, $44.23) for two years, and not a single analyst covering the stock expects it to outperform the broader market over the next 12 months or so.
Indeed, of the 20 analysts following the pharmacy chain, 18 rate shares at Hold, one says Sell and one calls it a Strong Sell. Sluggish revenue growth and stagnant margins have been familiar drags on past results, and WBA faces additional headwinds going forward into 2023. 
Sign up for Kiplinger's FREE Closing Bell e-letter: Our daily look at the stock market's most important headlines, and what moves investors should make.
Raymond James analyst John Ransom rates WBA at Market Perform (the equivalent of Hold), citing difficult comparisons against COVID-19-related results, the ending of tobacco sales and the sale of its Boots business. 
Walgreen is shopping its Boots international drugstore chain to buyout firms, according to multiple reports. 
WBA is also facing reimbursement pressure from insurers that will weigh on pharmacy gross margins, Ransom adds.
At the same time, management's earnings guidance is tepid.
""The company’s new growth plan anticipates 4% annualized earnings growth over the next three years, with a flat performance in fiscal 2022, accelerating through fiscal 2024,"" writes Argus Research analyst Christopher Graja (Hold).
Analysts forecast the company to generate average annual earnings per share (EPS) growth of just 2.5% over the next three to five years. As such, WBA, which trades at 8.6 times analysts' 2022 EPS estimate, would indeed appear to be fairly valued at current levels.
All this justifies one of the worst ratings among the 30 Dow Jones stocks.

28. Intel
Market value: $190.1 billion
Dividend yield: 3.1%
Analysts' consensus recommendation: 2.83 (Hold)
Intel (INTC, $46.50) shares have been stuck with a consensus recommendation of Hold for about two years, and the Street sees little reason to become more constructive on the semiconductor stock.
The world's largest chipmaker does have some remarkable strengths. Its central processing units (CPUs) are found in 84% of desktop PCs and 78% of laptops. INTC furthermore commands roughly 90% of the market for servers, which are in high demand amid the shift to cloud-based computing. 
The downside is that the Dow stock missed out on some of the most important trends of the past 15 years, notably mobile, and is losing market share to competitors in core areas. 
That helps explain the stock's high number of Sell calls, which are a scarce sighting on the Street. Of the 41 analysts issuing opinions on INTC, five have it at Sell and three rate it at Strong Sell. The remaining recommendations break down to seven Strong Buys, four Buys and a whopping 22 Holds.
BofA Securities analyst Vivek Arya rates shares at Underperform (the equivalent of Sell), citing a number of factors. 
Increased competition from the likes of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Nvidia (NVDA) and Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) loom large, Arya says. Then there's Intel’s ""large exposure to the decelerating PC market,"" its ""years of cash burn despite government incentives"" and a ""lowered quality of reported earnings,"" among other issues the analyst notes.

27. Travelers
Market value: $44.4 billion
Dividend yield: 1.9%
Analysts' consensus recommendation: 2.76 (Hold)
Travelers (TRV, $184.94) is another blue chip among the 30 Dow Jones stocks that has generated a distinct lack of analyst enthusiasm for a long time. Indeed, shares have carried a consensus recommendation of Hold for more than two years and counting. 
Unfortunately, it appears an increasingly difficult global backdrop won't help TRV break out of its ratings slump anytime soon. 
""The property-casualty insurance market was already 'hard,'"" says CFRA Research analyst Catherine Seifert (Hold). ""The Russian invasion of Ukraine will serve as a catalyst for further market hardening.""
Although the P&C insurer is a ""prudent underwriter that has managed its book of business well,"" Seifert remains cautious on TRV stock because the firm's growth rate remains below that of peers. 
""We view the shares as fairly valued versus historical averages,"" writes Seifert, and that's pretty much the majority view on the Street. Of the 21 analysts issuing opinions on TRV, four rate it at Strong Buy and three call it a Sell, while 14 have it at Hold.
That tepid collective outlook is based partly on valuation. Analysts forecast Travelers to generate average annual EPS growth of just 4.3% over the next three to five years, and yet shares trade at 14.1 times the Street's 2022 EPS estimate. 
To put that multiple in further context, TRV traded at an average of just 12.7 times expected EPS over the past five years, per data from Refinitiv Stock Reports Plus. As long as Travelers’ stock looks pricey compared to what it historically fetches, analyst upgrades will probably be in short supply.

26. Amgen
Market value: $133.5 billion
Dividend yield: 3.1%
Analysts' consensus recommendation: 2.70 (Hold)
The Street has become incrementally more bearish on Amgen (AMGN, $250.04) over the past nine months or so, but the biotechnology company is not without its ardent fans.
Amgen specializes in cancer and autoimmune diseases, and it's presently enjoying success with cholesterol drug Repatha and plaque psoriasis treatment Otezla, among other therapeutics. Bulls are counting on new launches, such as oncology drug Lumakras and Tezspire for asthma, and the return of cash to shareholders to drive market-beating returns going forward.
Sign up for Kiplinger's FREE Investing Weekly e-letter for stock, ETF and mutual fund recommendations, and other investing advice.
""We view AMGN as well-positioned with a prudent strategy,"" writes Oppenheimer analyst Jay Olson, who rates shares at Outperform (the equivalent of Buy). ""AMGN remains committed to dividend growth and share repurchases.""
But a number of analysts are taking a more cautious approach until they can gauge the performance of new drugs. If current in-house bets fail to deliver, Amgen might need to overhaul its pipeline with a ""transformative"" deal, the thinking goes.
""Two key launches next year will likely dictate how much the company needs to target acquisition of late-stage assets,"" writes Raymond James analyst Dane Leone, who rates shares at Market Perform (Hold). 
Of the 27 analysts issuing opinions on the stock, five rate it at Strong Buy, two say Buy, 18 call it a Hold and two say Strong Sell. 
That said, AMGN is indeed off to a strong start in 2022, gaining 7.5% on a price basis in the first quarter. That beat the S&P 500 by more than 12 percentage points.

25. International Business Machines
Market value: $113.3 billion
Dividend yield: 5.2%
Analysts' consensus recommendation: 2.63 (Hold)
International Business Machines (IBM, $125.98) gets a lot of lukewarm reviews from analysts, which seems fair enough. After all, they've watched Big Blue's top line shrink relentlessly for more than a decade. 
Four analysts rate IBM at Strong Buy, one says Buy, 13 call it a Hold and one says Strong Sell. That works out to a consensus recommendation of Hold – a rating the tech stock has languished at for years. 
IBM spun off its managed infrastructure operations into a separate publicly traded company called Kyndryl Holdings (KD) in late 2021. The company now counts on hybrid cloud and artificial intelligence (AI) services as its main engines of growth. 
Whether a leaner IBM can thrive in those highly competitive areas remains very much to be seen, analysts say.
Bulls, such as Argus Research's Jim Kelleher (Buy), applaud the ""new"" IBM's higher-margin, subscription-based revenue structure. 
""The main difference at the new IBM is in margins,"" Kelleher says. ""The more favorable business mix resulting from the focus on growth markets and the Kyndryl spinoff is expected to drive strong free cash flow generation, even on a substantially lower revenue base.""
On the other side of the trade, UBS Global Research analyst David Vogt rates IBM stock at Sell, citing worries about the company's free cash flow generation after the Kyndryl spinoff, rising interest rates and ""concerns around growth sustainability,"" among other factors.
If nothing else, IBM has always come through for income investors. This S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrat has increased its dividend for 26 consecutive years.

24. Dow
Market value: $46.5 billion
Dividend yield: 4.4%
Analysts' consensus recommendation: 2.59 (Hold)
Dow (DOW, $63.26) has been enjoying strong demand for packaging and consumer products related to the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, but tangled supply chains and input cost inflation make some analysts leery of the name at current levels.
The specialty chemicals and materials company gets a consensus recommendation of Hold, but with a bullish tilt. Five analysts rate DOW at Strong Buy, two say Buy, 13 have it at Hold, one says Sell and one calls it a Strong Sell. 
Argus Research analyst Bill Selesky (Buy) counts himself among those who forecast shares to deliver market-beating results in the year ahead. 
""We expect Dow to benefit from stronger realized prices for commodity chemicals and increased demand in North America and China,"" Selesky says. ""We also have a favorable view of Dow’s low cost structure, solid cash flow, declining capital spending requirements and sustainable dividend.""
DOW stock beat the broader market by 16 percentage points in the first quarter, and yet it remains compellingly valued. Indeed, shares trade for just 9 times the Street's 2022 EPS estimate. That's well below their own five-year average of more than 15 times forward earnings, according to data from Refinitiv Stock Reports Plus. Furthermore, analysts forecast the company to generate average annual EPS growth of 6.3% over the next three to five years. 
And yet logistical challenges and rising costs for energy and other commodities have the bulk of analysts sitting on the sidelines.

23. Verizon
Market value: $225.4 billion
Dividend yield: 4.8%
Analysts' consensus recommendation: 2.57 (Hold)
Analysts have become incrementally more bullish on Verizon (VZ, $53.67) over the past six months, but they still give the communication services giant a consensus recommendation of Hold.
Five analysts rate VZ at Strong Buy, four say Buy, 18 call it a Hold and one says Strong Sell. Those remaining cautious on the name frequently cite VZ's heavy spending as a reason to stay on the sidelines.
Although the telco is enjoying gains in 5G subscribers and upgrades, investors should ""expect near-term headwinds to margins from investments in marketing and device subsidies,"" says Deutsche Bank analyst Bryan Kraft (Hold).
At Oppenheimer, analyst Timothy Horan likewise cites higher expenses as part of his Perform (the equivalent of Hold) rating on shares. 
On the brighter side, shareholders can look forward to some cost relief soon, the analyst adds. Capital expenditures are projected to peak this year as VZ brings its 5G C-band spectrum online, Horan says.
Among the bulls, Truist analyst Greg Miller rates shares at Buy, citing management's ""credible plan for growth, margin improvement and share repurchases.""
Miller also likes Verizon’s valuation, which does look attractive. Shares trade at 9.7 times the Street's 2022 EPS estimate. That offers a discount of nearly 17% to its own five-year average, according to data from Refinitiv Stock Reports Plus.
And certainly no analyst quibbles with the dividend. Verizon boasts the second highest yield of any Dow stock, thanks in no small part to 18 consecutive years of dividend increases.

22. JPMorgan Chase
Market value: $386.7 billion
Dividend yield: 3.0%
Analysts' consensus recommendation: 2.38 (Buy)
JPMorgan Chase (JPM, $131.54) is the first of our Dow Jones stocks to receive a consensus recommendation of Buy – albeit with pretty moderate conviction.
Of the 26 analysts issuing opinions, seven rate JPM at Strong Buy, six say Buy, 11 have it at Hold and two say Strong Sell. 
No one disputes that JPM has an outstanding collection of business lines. Or that the nation's biggest bank by assets boasts an unparalleled management team, led by CEO Jamie Dimon. 
It's simply that a number of analysts believe investors can find better bets in the company's sector.
""On most key bank metrics, JPM is best in class,"" writes CFRA Research analyst Kenneth Leon (Hold) ""JPM benefits from economic growth, moderate loan balance growth for consumers and strength in capital markets. But we think other large banks have more upside potential on relative improving fundamentals.""
A similar line of argument led Jefferies analyst Ken Usdin to downgrade JPM in February, to Hold from Buy.
""JPM is well-positioned for higher interest rates, which will lead to improved net interest income growth,"" Usdin writes, ""but tough comparisons in many fee businesses will work against the grain, especially with the large increase in expenses planned in 2022 and potentially higher beyond.""
Wherever the stock goes from here, it's worth noting that JPM has been one of the 30 best stocks of the past 30 years.

21. Johnson & Johnson
Market value: $473.1 billion
Dividend yield: 2.4%
Analysts' consensus recommendation: 2.32 (Buy)
The big news with healthcare-sector giant Johnson & Johnson (JNJ, $179.90) these days is its plan to spin off its consumer health business – the one that makes Tylenol, Band-Aid and Listerine – from its pharmaceutical and medical devices segments. 
The move is meant to liberate the company's faster-growth, higher margin operations from the drag of slower-growth, less profitable endeavors – and analysts, for the most part, like it.
That said, the Street's consensus Buy recommendation does include a number of dissenters. Six analysts rate JNJ at Strong Buy, two say Buy, 10 have it at Hold and one calls it a Sell. 
Among those sitting on the sidelines is BofA Securities analyst Geoff Meacham, who initiated coverage of JNJ in March at Neutral (the equivalent of Hold). Although the short-term backdrop looks ""good,"" Meacham says ""higher long-term uncertainty"" prevents him from being more constructive on shares. 
""We like J&J's near-term growth prospects, driven by continued pharma strength, as well as its 'safe haven' status in a challenging macro/geopolitical environment,"" Meacham writes. ""That said, as the 'return to normal' trade plays out with diminishing COVID-19 headwinds and a growing risk appetite heading into the elections this fall, JNJ shares are likely to be a source of funds.""
Bulls, meanwhile, point to the Dow stock’s defensive characteristics, including its almost incomparable record of dividend growth. This member of the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats has increased its payout annually for 60 years.

20. Caterpillar
Market value: $116.1 billion
Dividend yield: 2.1%
Analysts' consensus recommendation: 2.30 (Buy)
Shares in Caterpillar (CAT, $216.70) are beating the broader market by a wide margin so far this year, and the Street's collective wisdom forecasts more outperformance ahead.
The world's largest manufacturer of heavy construction and mining equipment has heavy exposure to energy and other commodities. That makes it a great way to play rapidly rising prices around the globe, bulls say. 
""CAT has historically been a strong hedge to commodity and general inflation,"" says Jefferies analyst Stephen Volkmann, who upgraded CAT to Buy from Hold in early March. ""We believe the Russia/Ukraine crisis has fundamentally altered global commodity markets and is likely to drive a decade of reinvestment, similar to what the world experienced in the 1970s.""
UBS Global Research analyst Steven Fisher (Buy) concurs with that investment thesis, adding he expects a ""strong acceleration in margins in late 2022 and 2023 as steel and other input costs normalize vs. 2021 highs.""
Jefferies and UBS have plenty of company in the bull camp; 11 analysts rate CAT at Strong Buy and four say Buy. Of the remaining analysts, 12 call shares a Hold, one says Sell and two say Strong Sell. That works out to a consensus recommendation of Buy with good if not great conviction.
Long-term income investors should know that CAT sports a reliable and rising dividend. This member of the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats has lifted its payout for 27 consecutive years and counting.

19. Cisco Systems
Market value: $215.3 billion
Dividend yield: 2.9%
Analysts' consensus recommendation: 2.28 (Buy)
The information technology sector is trailing the broader market by a wide margin so far in 2022, and Cisco Systems (CSCO, $51.82) stock, off nearly 20% year-to-date, has been no exception. 
The Street's consensus view, however, suggests CSCO's selloff is overdone.
Analysts remain mostly bullish on the networking, cloud and cybersecurity giant – which regularly ranks among hedge funds' top blue-chip stocks to buy – thanks to a long and painful transition finally bearing fruit. Cisco has been moving away from being overly dependent on hardware such as internet routers and switches to more profitable software subscriptions and cloud-based services.
""Cisco remains the dominant networking vendor with strong underlying fundamentals,"" says Oppenheimer analyst Ittai Kidron (Outperform). ""We're positive on opportunities in software-as-a-service/Cloud driving more recurring revenue. Given share repurchases helping to support the shares, we see opportunity to own Cisco.""
CFRA Research likewise likes the Dow stock’s commitment to returning cash to shareholders. Analyst Keith Snyder cites the company's February dividend hike and $15 billion increase to its stock repurchase program among reasons to buy CSCO shares.
Indeed, Cisco sports a reliable and rising dividend, having increased its payout annually for 13 years. The board declared the most recent hike in February – a 3% increase in the quarterly payout to 38 cents per share. 
Of the 29 analysts issuing opinions on CSCO tracked by S&P Global Market Intelligence, eight call it a Strong Buy, five say Buy and 16 rate it at Hold.

18. American Express
Market value: $132.9 billion
Dividend yield: 1.2%
Analysts' consensus recommendation: 2.28 (Buy)
The Street has become significantly more bullish on American Express (AXP, $175.54) over the past several months, helped by the easing of the global pandemic and rising consumer prices.
COVID-19 depressed transaction volumes across AXP's industry, notably in travel, leisure and cross-border spending. But American Express is now enjoying some relief from those trends.
Meanwhile, inflation actually helps AmEx. The firm takes a cut of every transaction via merchant fees. When consumers rack up larger bills, AXP's piece of that pie grows accordingly.
Indeed, rising inflation forms part of Wells Fargo's bullish stance on the stock – even as macroeconomic risks persist.
""AXP remains our Top Pick for 2022,"" says Wells Fargo analyst Donald Fandetti, who rates shares at Overweight (the equivalent of Buy), ""but they are not fully immune to consumer credit fears and financial stock sentiment around the yield curve."" 
At William Blair equity research, analyst Robert Napoli (Outperform) praises AXP's ""substantial network expansion,"" and its ""focus on the premium consumer and younger cohorts,"" among other factors. 
""American Express deserves a premium to the S&P 500 given its consistently higher historical and projected revenue and earnings growth rates,"" Napoli writes.
Let's also not forget that AmEx is one of Warren Buffett's all-time favorite stocks. The Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B) CEO first bought shares in 1963 and remains AXP's largest stockholder by far today.
Seven analysts rate this Dow stock at Strong Buy, five say Buy, 12 have it at Hold and one calls it a Sell.

17. Honeywell
Market value: $130.9 billion
Dividend yield: 2.1%
Analysts' consensus recommendation: 2.22 (Buy)
Honeywell (HON, $190.99) has underperformed the broader market by so much, for so long, that it presents an exceptional opportunity to get one of the higher-quality Dow Jones stocks at a great price, bulls say.
Shares in the industrial stock are lagging the S&P 500 not only for the year-to-date, but for the past one, three and five years, as well. And although HON has picked up since the market's mid-March pivot, it remains not far off its 52-week low.
""This is rare,"" writes Argus Research analyst John Eade (Buy), arguing that HON's price doesn't square with its buy-and-hold market-beating potential.
""Honeywell is a leading blue-chip industrial company that is poised to generate low double-digit earnings growth over the long term,"" Eade says. ""Honeywell will continue to benefit from its diverse product lines, as well as from its leading presence in the commercial aerospace and commercial construction markets.""
True, the pandemic upended Honeywell's record of growth in 2020. However, the company is recovering, even as a ""slowdown in defense spending and higher supply-chain costs have recently affected results,"" Eade adds.
Bulls additionally point to Honeywell's dividend and its ample yield in a low rate environment. Even better, HON has hiked its payout for 13 consecutive years. 
Nine analysts rate Honeywell's stock at Strong Buy, five say Buy, 12 have it at Hold and one says Strong Sell. That works out to a consensus recommendation of Buy, with solid if not stellar conviction.

16. Procter & Gamble
Market value: $381.2 billion
Dividend yield: 2.2%
Analysts' consensus recommendation: 2.17 (Buy)
The Street has become incrementally more bullish on Procter & Gamble (PG, $159.01) in 2022, which certainly makes sense. Consumer staples stocks tend to hold up well when inflation is on the rise, and P&G in particular is as defensive a dividend stalwart as they come.
Nine analysts rate shares at Strong Buy, four say Buy, 10 have it at Hold and one says Strong Sell, per S&P Global Market Intelligence.
Raymond James, for one, counts itself among the bulls. Analyst Oliva Tong initiated coverage of PG at Outperform in early April, citing its defensive characteristics, among other factors.
""Strategy and portfolio changes in the last several years have clearly paid off, driving improved top- and bottom-line growth,'' Tong writes. ""PG's improved ability to navigate volatility, cushion itself against costs with its own initiatives and focus on innovation position it well to sustain its momentum.""
That said, even bullish analysts are anxious to see how P&G fares in a world of intense economic and geopolitical stress. 
""We view PG's quarter as increasingly important against a market backdrop debating U.S. recession, the immediate and secondary impacts of Russia/Ukraine, as well as slowing and challenging growth in China,"" writes Deutsche Bank analyst Steve Powers (Buy).
One thing about this Dow stock that's never in doubt is its commitment to returning cash to shareholders. This member of the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats has paid a dividend since 1890, and has raised its payout for 66 years in a row.

15. Goldman Sachs
Market value: $108.1 billion
Dividend yield: 2.5%
Analysts' consensus recommendation: 2.11 (Buy)
The Street expects a tough first quarter for Goldman Sachs (GS, $319.78) and other large financial stocks, but still sees GS stock as priced for outperformance in the year ahead.
Mergers and acquisitions, debt underwriting, initial public offerings (IPOs) and other staple investment banking activities are forecast to have slumped across the industry in Q1, hurt by ""geopolitical risks from Russia's invasion of Ukraine,"" notes CFRA Research analyst Kenneth Leon (Buy). 
But happily for Goldman Sachs, the outlook isn't entirely one of doom and gloom.
""Fixed income, currencies and commodities are likely to see elevated trading given wider spreads and higher risks to geopolitical and macroeconomic factors,"" Leon adds. 
Most importantly, Leon and other Goldman bulls say dour market sentiment has left GS attractively undervalued. And going by the yield on Goldman's dividend, shares do look heavily discounted.
Consider that at one point in early April, Goldman's yield topped 2.3%. (Stock prices and yields move in opposite directions.) To put that in context, GS's five-year average dividend yield stands at 1.6%. The five-year median yield is even lower.
Eight analysts rate GS at Strong Buy and eight say Buy, while 11 call it a Hold. The Street's average price target of $425.38 gives GS stock implied upside of 30% over the next 12 months.

14. Chevron
Market value: $332.1 billion
Dividend yield: 3.4%
Analysts' consensus recommendation: 2.11 (Buy)
Analysts have long been bullish on Chevron (CVX, $169.01), and now surging oil prices only reinforce their case for shares to generate even more market-beating returns.
Of the 28 analysts tracking the Dow's lone energy-sector stock, 10 call it a Strong Buy, seven say Buy, nine have it at Hold and two rate it at Sell. 
""With the strongest financial base of the majors, coupled with an attractive relative asset portfolio, Chevron offers the most straightforwardly positive risk/reward,"" writes Raymond James analyst Justin Jenkins (Outperform).
Bulls also praise CVX's ability to benefit from rising energy prices while carrying less risk from any decline in prices for gasoline and other refined petroleum products.
""Among its integrated peers, Chevron has above-average leverage to crude oil prices and the lowest exposure to the downstream,"" writes UBS Global Research analyst Lloyd Byrne (Buy).
Rising oil prices also help CVX return more cash to shareholders, the analyst says, noting the company recently essentially doubled its annual buyback target to $5 billion to $10 billion, up from $3 billion from $5 billion. 
""At $75 per barrel for Brent crude oil, CVX believes it can buy back approximately 25% of shares outstanding over 5 years,"" Byrne adds. ""At $50 per barrel Brent, the current buyback can be maintained and the dividend still grown.""
On that last point, it's true that few companies have been as committed to dividend growth as Chevron has. This member of the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats has increased its payout for 35 consecutive years.

13. Merck
Market value: $216.5 billion
Dividend yield: 3.2%
Analysts' consensus recommendation: 2.04 (Buy)
The bull case on Merck (MRK, $85.63) used to be that shares had underperformed the market by such a wide margin for so long that they were too cheap to ignore.
Now, the pharma giant's stock is clobbering the S&P 500 for the year-to-date – and the Street says it has much more room to run.
Of the 26 analysts issuing opinions on MRK tracked by S&P Global Market Intelligence, 10 rate shares at Strong Buy, five say Buy and 11 have them at Hold.
Pros sitting on the sidelines point to Merck's heavy reliance on blockbuster cancer drug Keytruda, which will lose patent exclusivity in 2028. 
Bulls counter that Keytruda's loss of exclusivity is adequately reflected in the share price. They further argue that the market insufficiently values recent and potential acquisitions, as well as Merck's drug pipeline, which includes a new coronavirus treatment.
Although Keytruda is indeed ""a key growth driver,"" Argus Research analyst David Toung (Buy) notes that Merck's ""COVID-19 antiviral Molnupirarvir will make a substantial contribution in 2022."" 
The analyst also applauds Merck's $11.5 billion acquisition last year of Acceleron Pharma, which strengthens the firm's cardiovascular portfolio. And MRK is likely to pursue additional pipeline-boosting deals, Toung adds.
True, bears will note that Warren Buffett completely sold out of Berkshire Hathaway's position in Merck in Q3.
Bulls, on the other hand, can tout the fact that Merck routinely makes the list of hedge funds' top 25 blue-chip stocks.

12. Boeing
Market value: $104.1 billion
Dividend yield: N/A
Analysts' consensus recommendation: 1.91 (Buy)
Boeing (BA, $176.28) can't seem to catch a break. Over the past few years the company has been hammered by the grounding of 737 Max jets, production issues with the 787 Dreamliner, the pandemic-caused collapse in global air travel and, most recently, the crash of a Boeing commercial airliner in China. 
But the Street tilts toward bullishness on the name, figuring the worst run of bad news – and share-price underperformance – is behind the aerospace giant.
Twelve analysts rate BA at Strong Buy, five say Buy, four have it at Hold and two call it a Strong Sell. 
BofA Securities, for one, counts itself in the Hold camp. Analyst Ronald J. Epstein rates Boeing stock at Neutral, citing the company's litany of challenges ahead. 
""In the next five years, Boeing faces headwinds,"" Epstein writes. ""Boeing needs to overcome the market share loss in the large narrowbody market (737 MAX 9/10), as well as managing production issues on the 787 and the 777X.""
On the other side of the trade stands CFRA Research analyst Colin Scarola (Strong Buy), who says the market is failing to price in an improving macro backdrop and better-than-expected free cash flow generation, among other factors.
""Our forecast is for total revenue to recover to 1% above 2018 level in 2024, by which time global aircraft demand will have fully recovered,"" Scarola writes. 
The analyst adds that BA posted ""surprising positive free cash flow"" in the fourth quarter and paid down $2.6 billion in debt ""despite still depressed aircraft delivery rates.""

11. Coca-Cola
Market value: $279.9 billion
Dividend yield: 2.7%
Analysts' consensus recommendation: 1.88 (Buy)
The Street is collectively bullish on one of Warren Buffett's all-time favorite stocks. Berkshire Hathaway first bought Coca-Cola (KO, $64.56) in 1988, and KO remains the holding company's fourth largest position today. 
Analysts are fans of the soft drinks maker too. Not only is KO one of the best dividend stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average for total return potential, it's a dividend growth investor's dream come true. This S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrat has increased its payout for 60 consecutive years.  
Coca-Cola was hit hard by the pandemic, which shut down restaurants, bars, live events and myriad other venues serving its vast portfolio of sodas, juices, teas, sports and energy drinks. Those sales are now coming back.
""While the company has seen significant disruption from COVID-19, we believe that earnings probably bottomed in the second quarter of 2020,"" writes Argus Research analyst Chris Graja (Buy). ""Revenue should continue to improve as economies reopen and consumers return to restaurants and, eventually, to amusement parks and sporting events.""
The resurrection in revenue prompted CFRA Research analyst Garrett Nelson to upgrade KO to Buy from Hold in January, citing Coke's ""fundamentals and strong underlying momentum from the rebound in on-premise sales and robust pricing environment.""
The Street gives shares a consensus recommendation of Buy, with high conviction. Twelve analysts rate KO at Strong Buy and six say Buy, while just seven call it a Hold and only one says Sell, per S&P Global Market Intelligence.

10. Walt Disney
Market value: $238.2 billion
Dividend yield: N/A*
Analysts' consensus recommendation: 1.79 (Buy)
As a sprawling media and entertainment conglomerate, analysts see Walt Disney (DIS, $130.84) as an obvious way to play the post-COVID economy.
True, Disney stock is trailing the broader market by a wide margin so far in 2022. But analysts say it's only a matter of time before a sort of ""recovery trade 2.0"" reinflates DIS shares.
Indeed, they forecast the company to generate average annual EPS growth of more than 46% over the next three to five years. 
Remember: The coronavirus took a huge bite out of some of the company's most important divisions (specifically, its theme parks and studios). Those businesses are now coming back.
Wells Fargo Securities analyst Steven Cahall rates DIS at Overweight, citing, in part, a recovery in traffic to the company's amusement parks. Deutsche Bank analyst Bryan Kraft likewise cites amusement park attendance in making his Buy call on shares.
The analysts have plenty of company, as the Street's consensus recommendation stands at Buy, with high conviction. Fourteen analysts rate DIS at Strong Buy, seven say Buy and eight have it at Hold. Their average target price of $186.56 gives DIS stock implied upside of 40% in the next 12 months or so. 
It's also worth mentioning that DIS ranks as one of hedge funds' 25 top blue-chip stocks to buy now, as well as one of the 30 best stocks of the past 30 years.

9. Home Depot
Market value: $316.5 billion
Dividend yield: 2.5%
Analysts' consensus recommendation: 1.79 (Buy)
Home Depot (HD, $306.29) stock has lost a quarter of its value and is lagging the broader market by a wide margin for the year-to-date, hurt by rising interest rates and inflationary pressures, among other issues.
The Street, however, says the drawdown affords investors an opportunity to get a great stock at a good price.
Home Depot has long been one of the Street's favorite ways to play the housing market. HD also proved to be a profitable way to play COVID-19. And although shares are stumbling of late, analysts believe shifts in consumer behavior unleashed by the pandemic will help this Dow stock to return to its market-beating ways.
Although input cost pressures, rising rates and difficult comparisons to past pandemic-inflated results have some analysts sitting on the sidelines, the Street's consensus recommendation comes to Buy, with high conviction. Seventeen analysts rate HD at Strong Buy, seven say Buy, eight have it at Hold and one calls it a Sell.
BofA Securities analyst Elizabeth Suzuki is in the Buy camp on HD, citing an attractive valuation and the company's ""resilience,"" as well as ""likely market share gains and consistent execution.""
HD stock does indeed look compellingly priced based on relative valuation. Shares trade at 19 times analysts' next-12-months EPS estimate. That represents a discount of 11% to the stock's own five-year average, per Refinitiv Stock Reports Plus. 
Meanwhile, analysts' average target price of $378.17 gives HD stock implied upside of 23% in the next year or so.

8. McDonald's
Market value: $184.3 billion
Dividend yield: 2.2%
Analysts' consensus recommendation: 1.78 (Buy)
McDonald's (MCD, $249.17) has always done well by income investors. The fast food chain also happens to be one of the best Dow dividend stocks to buy now. And it's a member of the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats, having raised its payout annually for 45 years. 
But analysts like MCD's potential for share-price appreciation in the shorter term, too. That's why the Street's consensus recommendation stands at Buy, with high conviction. 
McDonald’s stock stumbled earlier this year when the company halted operations in Russia in response to that country's invasion of Ukraine. But bulls believe any related pullback is a chance to buy MCD on weakness.
""In 2021, the Russia/Ukraine market represented less than 3% of MCD's consolidated operating profits,"" says Oppenheimer analyst Brian Bittner (Outperform). ""Our work suggests MCD's above-average exposure to Russia/Ukraine is now fully priced in.""
Bulls also praise the way MCD responded to the worst of the pandemic by greatly improving efficiency. That's a change that should deliver long-tail returns, they say.
""While drive-thrus have provided about 70% of revenue for decades, simplified menus during the pandemic have enabled MCD to increase the number of orders it can process,"" says Argus Research analyst John Staszak (Buy). 
Eighteen analysts rate 18 MCD stock at Strong Buy, nine say Buy and 10 have it at Hold, per S&P Global Market Intelligence.
Meanwhile, their 12-month average price target of $280.60 gives McDoanld’s implied upside of about 13%. Add in the dividend yield, and the Street sees MCD delivering market-beating returns in the year ahead.

7. Walmart
Market value: $421.7 billion
Dividend yield: 1.5%
Analysts' consensus recommendation: 1.74 (Buy)
If there's one thing analysts and investors alike have learned about Walmart (WMT, $153.23), it's that you don't bet against the world's biggest retailer – and largest company by revenue – for too long. 
Heck, the discount retail chain is among the top 10 best global stocks of the past 30 years. 
Shares are beating the broader market by a wide margin so far in 2022, helped by the company's commitment to low prices.
CFRA Research analyst Arun Sundaram (Buy) expects WMT's momentum to continue ""as consumers likely become increasingly price conscious, with inflation being at a 40-year high."" The analyst notes that Walmart's average price gap relative to its competition continues to widen versus pre-pandemic levels. 
""We also believe investors are underappreciating WMT's evolving business model, including omnichannel transformation and its high-margin alternative profit streams (e.g., advertising is now over $2 billion in annual revenues),"" Sundaram adds. 
Once an online also-ran, Walmart's ""omnichannel transformation"" has made it the nation's second largest e-commerce retailer after Amazon.com (AMZN). 
Another argument for Walmart is its ability to weather economic downturn, should that come to pass. Wells Fargo Securities, for example, includes WMT stock on its list of ""best recession plays.""
Walmart boasts one of the strongest Buy ratings among the 30 Dow Jones stocks. Of the 38 analysts issuing opinions on WMT tracked by S&P Global Market Intelligence, 20 rate it at Strong Buy, eight call it a Buy, and 10 have it at Hold. They forecast the company to generate average annual EPS growth of 8.3% over the next three to five years.

6. UnitedHealth Group
Market value: $502.2 billion
Dividend yield: 1.1%
Analysts' consensus recommendation: 1.67 (Buy)
With a market value of more than $500 billion and a 2022 revenue estimate of $319.5 billion, UnitedHealth Group (UNH, $533.71) is the largest publicly traded health insurer by a wide margin.
Analysts praise the company on a number of fronts, and frequently single out contributions from Optum, its pharmacy benefits manager segment. 
""We remain impressed by the year-to-year consistency UNH shows as it continues to exceed expectations by navigating the industry's many pitfalls,"" writes Oppenheimer analyst Michael Wiederhorn (Outperform). ""We continue to believe UNH remains the bellwether in the healthcare services space, and we remain buyers of UNH.""
Oppenheimer has plenty of company on the Street, which gives UNH a consensus recommendation of Buy, with high conviction. Of the 24 analysts issuing opinions on the stock, 14 call it a Strong Buy, six have it at Buy, three say Hold and one rates UNH at Sell, per S&P Global Market Intelligence.
UNH's robust long-term growth forecast is another point in the bulls' favor. The Street forecasts the health insurer to generate average annual EPS growth of 13.9% over the next three to five years. 
Although shares trade at a seemingly pricey at 24.8 times the Street's 2022 EPS estimate, Argus Research's David Toung (Buy) says UNH's ""solid growth drivers"" support its premium valuation.
""UnitedHealth's combination of top-line growth and margin expansion is also driving an industry-leading return on investment,"" Toung adds.

5. Apple
Market value: $2.7 trillion
Dividend yield: 0.5%
Analysts' consensus recommendation: 1.65 (Buy)
Apple (AAPL, $167.66), the world's largest publicly traded company, is beloved by analysts, but no less a luminary than Warren Buffett is truly head over heels for the stock. 
That's because Apple isn't just a purveyor of gadgets; it sells an entire ecosystem of personal consumer electronics and related services. And it's a sticky ecosystem, at that.
Buffett has called the iPhone maker Berkshire Hathaway's ""third business,"" noting Apple fans' fantastic brand loyalty as one reason for being all-in on the stock. (Apple accounts for more than 46% of the value of Berkshire's equity portfolio.) 
And with Apple reigning as No. 1 among the best stocks of the past 30 years, who's going to argue with Buffett's ardor for the stock? 
Not the Street, that's for sure. 
Twenty-seven analysts 27 call AAPL a Strong Buy, seven say Buy, seven have it at Hold, one says Sell and one says Strong Sell. 
Apple might be best known for its gadgets and services, but investors shouldn't look past its emerging streaming media business, says Wedbush Securities, which has AAPL on its Best Ideas List.
After all, the company just made history as the first streamer to win an Academy Award for Best Picture with the film Coda, says analyst Daniel Ives (Outperform). 
""We view this Oscar win as a game changer for Apple on its content efforts,"" Ives writes. ""It legitimizes Apple TV+ as a major streaming platform with much more success ahead and the Street is now starting to take more notice.""

4. Nike
Market value: $196.8 billion
Dividend yield: 0.9%
Analysts' consensus recommendation: 1.59 (Buy)
Inflationary pressures and lockdowns in the massive consumer market of China haven't shaken the Street's faith in Nike (NKE, $125.04) stock. 
Indeed, with 20 analysts rating shares at Strong Buy, eight saying Buy and six calling them a Hold, Nike comes close to receiving a consensus recommendation of Strong Buy.
Partly that's a function of Nike's unique brand status in the footwear and apparel industry. Baird equity research analyst Jonathan Komp rates NKE at Outperform, noting its ability to thrive in tough times.
""For investors concerned about potential recession scenarios (not our base case), we again highlight our view that brand possessing a combination of strong fundamentals, relatively high operating margin (less levered to sales downside), pricing power and strong balance sheets would hold up the best, including NKE,"" Komp writes. 
Although macroeconomic headwinds could make for a bumpy few quarters, bulls say few stocks in Nike's subsector enjoy such strong buy-and-hold bona fides.  
""Over the long term, we expect Nike to continue to dominate the athletic apparel and footwear markets, and note that it has a particularly strong presence in high-end footwear thanks to its marketing strength,"" says Argus Research analyst John Staszak (Buy). ""We expect the company to build on its dominant position through its globally recognized brand, innovative products, economies of scale and rapid growth in emerging markets.""
With an average target price of $167.22, the Street gives NKE stock implied upside of about 34% in the next 12 months or so.

3. Visa
Market value: $443.5 billion
Dividend yield: 0.7%
Analysts' consensus recommendation: 1.51 (Buy)
Analysts, hedge funds, mutual fund managers and even Warren Buffett love Visa (V, $211.40). That's because they believe the world's largest payments network stands to reap outsized rewards from the massive and secular growth in cashless transactions.
The firm's pedigree no doubt has its appeal, as well. Visa is one of the 30 best stocks of the past 30 years. It also doesn't hurt that even after reducing its stake by 13% in the fourth quarter, Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway still owns 8.3 million shares in Visa, or 0.4% of its shares outstanding.
Little wonder then that Visa regularly makes the list of hedge funds' 25 top blue-chip stocks. It should also come as no surprise that shares garner a consensus recommendation just a whisper shy of Strong Buy.
""We are highly attracted to Visa's powerful brand, vast global acceptance network and strong business model,"" writes Oppenheimer analyst Dominick Gabriele (Outperform). ""The company is well positioned to benefit from the long-term secular shift from paper currency (cash/check) to plastic (electronic payments), consumer spending growth and increased globalization."" 
Oppenheimer, which calls Visa a ""top pick,"" has plenty of company. Twenty-one analysts call V a Strong Buy, 10 say Buy and four have it a Hold.
The Street forecasts Visa to generate average annual EPS growth of more than 18% over the next three to five years. True, shares might appear pricey given they trade at 30.3 times analysts' 2022 EPS estimate, but that's actually slightly below their own five-year average.

2. Salesforce.com
Market value: $192.9 billion
Dividend yield: N/A
Analysts' consensus recommendation: 1.50 (Strong Buy)
Salesforce (CRM, $194.81) stock has lost nearly a quarter of its value so far in 2022, but the Street says that just leaves it priced for market-beating performance ahead.
Indeed, the software-as-a-service (SaaS) juggernaut's stock is one of only two Dow Jones components to receive a consensus recommendation of Strong Buy. Thirty-two analysts call CRM a Strong Buy, 11 say Buy and seven have it at Hold.
That overwhelming bullishness is reflected in the Street's average target price. At $298.29, analysts give CRM implied upside of more than 50% in the next 12 months or so. 
Salesforce.com provides customer relationship management software to enterprise customers. It was essentially doing cloud-based services before they were cool. Bulls say that early mover advantage gives CRM an edge when it comes to capturing accelerating corporate spending on cloud-based services and products.
""Salesforce's customer diversification, product portfolio breadth and SaaS model is continuing to gain significant momentum in the field as the digital transformation spending cycle kicks into its next gear of growth,"" writes Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives (Outperform). ""Salesforce is in the catbird's seat to continue capitalizing on the large demand seen throughout the industry.""
The compelling bull case for shares – and CRM's massive market value and liquidity – makes them a frictionless fit for institutional investors buying and selling large positions. That explains in part why Salesforce.com routinely ranks among hedge funds' 25 top blue-chip stocks to buy.

1. Microsoft
Market value: $2.1 trillion
Dividend yield: 0.9%
Analysts' consensus recommendation: 1.32 (Strong Buy)
Microsoft (MSFT, $282.06) – second only to Apple among the best stocks of the past 30 years – is the Street's top-rated Dow component.
Of the 47 analysts issuing opinions on the software giant, 33 rate it at Strong Buy, 13 say Buy and one has it at Hold. That works out to a consensus recommendation of Strong Buy, with pretty high conviction to boot.
What gives MSFT the edge over every other Dow Jones stock in terms of analysts' favor is its overwhelming success in cloud services. Products such as Azure and Office 365 have proven to be huge hits with enterprise customers. And those customers are just getting started.
Analysts say corporations' ongoing digital transformation to cloud services represents a total addressable market of $1 trillion – and it's a market MSFT is especially well positioned to exploit.
""Microsoft remains our favorite large cap-cloud play as the Street further appreciates the cloud transformation story,"" writes Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives (Outperform). ""With workforces expected to have a heavy remote focus, we believe the cloud shift is just beginning to take its next stage of growth globally. This disproportionally benefits Microsoft.""
Wedbush has MSFT on its Best Ideas List and calls it one of its favorite names in tech for 2022. 
The putative smart money feels the same way. Quarter after quarter, Microsoft ranks at No. 1 on the list of hedge funds' top 25 blue-chip stocks to buy.

There is one company in the world that has what it takes to rival Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) in the multi-trillion-dollar global electric vehicle revolution. That company — U.S.-based luxury EV maker Lucid Motors — just confirmed that it will be going public through a merger with blank-check company Churchill Capital Corp IV (NYSE:CCIV). Yet, on confirmation of that merger, CCIV stock plunged.
Source: Jarretera / Shutterstock.com
This plunge in CCIV stock is a golden buying opportunity, for three big reasons:
 Merger execution risks surrounding CCIV stock have been eliminated. We now know that the value of CCIV stock is backed by the fundamental earnings power of Lucid Motors.
Operationally, Lucid Motors is where Tesla was 10 years ago — and has all the right ingredients and necessary firepower to turn into a major force in the global EV market soon.
Given the company’s long-term earnings growth potential, Lucid Motors is worth about $100 billion today. That implies a fair price for CCIV stock of over $60. Long-term, shares could soar to $400 — representing 10X upside potential from the CCIV stock price today.
So, forget these “buy the rumor, sell the news” dynamics. Instead, zoom out, focus on the big picture, and buy (and hold) Lucid Motors stock for the long haul.
CCIV Stock: Buy the Rumor, Sell the News
First, let’s talk about how Lucid Motors got here.
Get Luke Lango’s No. 1 Stock Pick for the Next Decade
There have been murmur for weeks that Lucid Motors would go public via a merger with blank-check company Churchill Capital Corp IV. On those rumors, CCIV stock soared rapidly. From $10 to nearly $70 in a matter of weeks.
Those rumors were confirmed yesterday. Lucid Motors said in a press release that it will, indeed, go public through a merger with Churchill Capital.
But CCIV stock sunk on the news – probably because the merger valued the company at $25 billion, while the CCIV stock price at the time was valuing Lucid Motors at about 4X that, or around $100 billion.
To that extent, the immediate, gut-reaction sell off in Lucid Motors stock makes sense.
But, the fundamentals here imply that Lucid Motors is actually worth more than $100 billion today, even though the company hasn’t sold a single car yet. Here’s why.
Everything It Takes to Be the Next Tesla
Zooming out, Lucid Motors has everything it takes — and, importantly, is the only company that has everything it takes — to be the “next Tesla.” This, of course, implies big things ahead for CCIV stock.
I’m not exaggerating when I say: “Lucid Motors has it all.”
The EV maker has the talent. The company is led by Peter Rawlinson, the former Chief Engineer of the Tesla Model S.
Supporting him is an impressive team of former Tesla, Audi, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Samsung, Ford (NYSE:F), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and General Motors (NYSE:GM) executives.
This is the most impressive confluence of talent in the EV industry outside of Tesla – and it’s not even close. Relative to Tesla, Lucid Motor’s management team stacks up equally (outside of Elon Musk, of course, which – admittedly – is a big difference).
Lucid Motors also has the resources. Following the closing of the SPAC merger, Lucid Motors is expected to have $4.5 billion plus existing cash on its balance sheet to fund its operations for the next several years. Again, this cash balance is unrivaled in the EV space by everyone except Tesla.
Lucid also has the branding and sales strategy to rival Tesla.
The company is positioning itself as a so-called “post-luxury” brand that focuses on elegance and modernity over the traditional legacy focus-points of opulence and indulgence.
Lucid designed its car with this post-luxury vibe in mind. Earthy tones. Sustainable materials. Simple controls. Connected ecosystem. End-to-end customer experience. Tech forward. Peaceful ambience … These are attributes consumers place a high value on today – and Lucid Motors knocks all of them out of the park.
It’s the dream car.
Lucid is selling this dream car through a 100% direct sales strategy, which encompasses selling cars online (through a modern, simple, fully-customizable, and straightforward digital sales process) and through Lucid-branded stores that look like luxury fashion showrooms.
In so doing, Lucid retains full control over the customer experience, and build and retain strong brand equity — much as Tesla has done with its direct sales model.
The Big Technology Edge
Most important to CCIV stock’s long-term success, Lucid Motors has some of the best and most protected technology in the EV industry.
Over the past 10 years, Lucid has developed, tested, and fine-tuned an entirely in-house, state-of-the-art electric drivetrain platform called the Lucid Electric Advanced Platform (LEAP).
LEAP comprises some key competitive technological advantages including:
A low-floor, wide-base “skateboard” EV platform that enables the company’s ultra-spacious “Space Concept” interior design;
An incredibly power dense drive unit that yields the most efficient battery in the EV industry with 4.5 miles / kWh (versus ~4 miles / kWh for Tesla Model S), and therefore unlocks farther driving ranges without compromising on performance;
An onboard boost-charge technology dubbed “Wunderbox” that enables ultra-fast charge rates and bi-directional power delivery that includes vehicle to grid and vehicle to vehicle charging.
Those are some major technological advantages inherent to LEAP. These advantages won’t disappear anytime soon. LEAP is backed by 403 patents – over 80% of which are already issued — so Lucid Motors should be able to adequately defend its EV technology lead for the foreseeable future, especially when you consider this company has more talent and resources than anyone else in the space save Tesla.
Strong Product, Big Demand & Huge Production, Too
Of course, Lucid Motors has manifested its strong technology into a great first product.
Lucid’s first car – the Lucid Air Dream, which will debut in the second half of 2021 – is an amazing car. It looks the part of luxury dream EV. It has all the technology and self-driving bells-and-whistles. And, perhaps most importantly, it features a best-in-class driving range of over 500 miles and industry-leading recharge time of 20 minutes for 300 miles.
This great first product from Lucid Motors has strong demand. Consumers are responding to the unrivaled specs and unique post-luxury branding by pre-ordering the car in bulk. As of February 2021, the company had received over 7,500 reservations that represent ~$650 million in potential sales.
Remember, that’s before the company has even delivered a product…
Of course, for many pre-production EV companies, mass production is a huge execution risk. After all, it is not easy to make hundreds of thousands of cars in a single year.
But Lucid Motors already has robust production capacity in place. The company has built the first state-of-the-art, greenfield EV manufacturing facility in North America, in its Advanced Manufacturing Plant (AMP-1) in Casa Grande, Arizona. That plant is expected to produce around 365,000 Lucid cars per year at full capacity.
All of these facts provide strong signal that CCIV stock is a big-time winner.
A Bold Vision to Drive Long-Term Growth
One thing I really like about Lucid Motors — and by extension now, CCIV stock — is that this management team has vision.
Much like Tesla, Lucid Motors won’t stop at making a superstar luxury EV. Indeed, Lucid Motors appears committed to following the Tesla playbook step-by-step to turn into a multi-vertical energy disruptor.
That is, the company intends to launch a premium sportscar first (like the Model S), then a premium SUV (like the Model X), and then leverage strong brand equity, superior in-house technology, and economies of scale to start producing more affordable EVs down the road (like the Model 3).
Beyond that, Lucid hopes to leverage its ultra-dense proprietary battery technology to make energy storage solutions, too – much as Tesla is doing right now with its Powerwall platform.
In other words, Lucid Motors may be a company that hasn’t sold an EV today — but by 2030, this will be a company that is selling hundreds of thousands of vehicles to consumers all across the globe, at all price points, while also installing onsite energy storage solutions, too.
Is Lucid Motors the Next Trillion-Dollar Company?
I think I covered all the bases there… and, by now, you should see the writing on the wall.
Lucid Air is a mini-Tesla, with all the right ingredients to one day potentially rival Tesla not just for global EV market supremacy, but for global clean energy market supremacy, too.
Yet, at the current CCIV stock price, Lucid Motors is just a $60 billion company. Tesla is a $700 billion company.
Could CCIV stock soar to a valuation that makes Lucid Motors worth $700 billion?
Yes.
Get Luke Lango’s No. 1 Stock Pick for the Next Decade
My numbers say that — assuming EVs take over the world, Lucid Motors nabs 8% global EV market share, nets average selling prices of about $40,000, and scales to 30% auto gross margins with ~20% operating margins – this will one day be a $600 billion company, even without the energy storage business.
Throw in the energy storage business, and you’re easily talking a $700+ BILLION company. If the energy storage business gains serious traction, then Lucid Motors could one day be a trillion-dollar company.
CCIV Stock Is Worth $70 Today
To be clear, these projections are many, many years into the future. Specifically, I don’t see Lucid Motors being worth $600+ billion until 2040.
Some of you may laugh that I have a 20-year model on Lucid Motors. But Lucid is where Tesla was 10 years ago. And 10 years ago, the only way to accurately value TSLA stock was through employing a 20-year model out to 2030.
Thus, I think the only appropriate way to value CCIV stock today is by using a 20-year model out to 2040, since Lucid Motors will still be in hypergrowth mode throughout most of the 2030s.
Now, because my price target for CCIV stock is basically 20 years out, we have to discount it back. Discounting it back by 10% per year, my numbers say that CCIV stock is worth about $70 today.
That’s where I expected shares to trend in the medium-term once the dust settles.
Bottom Line on CCIV Stock & Lucid Motors
Lucid Motors represents one of the most innovative companies in the world today, with enormous long-term growth potential. To that end, CCIV stock is a great long-term buy.
But it’s not the best growth stock to buy today.
Instead, the best growth stock to buy today is a company that reminds me of a young Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Indeed, I think buying this stock today could be like buying AMZN stock back in 1997 — before it soared thousands of percent.

Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is a chipmaker that has made the most of the pandemic. In fact, AMD stock is at some of its highest performance levels in recent memory.
AMD) logo outside of a corporate building"" width=""300"" height=""169"">

Now, the company is looking to expand its market share this year. Once traded in the $2 range, AMD currently changes hands closer to $100. More precisely, after reporting stellar fourth-quarter results, AMD stock has dipped to a little over $86 today. 
If you want to book profit in the coming months, this name should be on your radar. So, let’s take a look at two of its key drivers.
AMD Stock and the Xilinx Merger
The first driver behind AMD stock has to do with Xilinx (NASDAQ:XLNX). The company announced a merger with XLNX in October, planning to acquire it for $35 billion.
That combination will create a top computing entity and will all-around enhance AMD’s portfolio. Xilinx is a leader in programmable logic devices (PLDs) and will give AMD access to a diverse set of customers. With this acquisition, the company will also be able to include these devices into its portfolio. 
10 Dividend Stocks Increasing Their Payouts 
Those PLDs are central components to various products that target different markets, like telecom for example. As such, AMD will get a chance to tap into markets that lie outside its traditional range. That can give Advanced Micro a bit a of a cushion, too — in a post-pandemic world, if the demand for PCs and servers decline, the company will have a new market to target. All in all, both the businesses complement each other and the merge gives competitors like Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) a lot to worry about.
Deals like the AMD-Xilinx merger usually take time to close because of regulatory approval, but there have been no big hurdles so far. So, if AMD manages to integrate the businesses and market Xilinx’s products well, it could hit new revenue highs. Of course, that’s great news for investors. 
A Strong Hold of the Gaming Industry
Last month, I talked about this company’s extensive lineup of products that will continue to drive growth. I am bullish on AMD stock because of that technological edge. More specifically, AMD continues to enjoy a strong hold of the gaming industry.
Advanced Micro Devices supplies chips for both Microsoft’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Sony’s (NYSE:SNE) gaming consoles. To that end, both of those companies claim that their recent next-gen console launches this year have been their biggest ever. So, AMD has experienced unprecedented demand recently because of the gaming industry. This momentum is also expected to continue in the second half of 2021.
Back in late January, Rosenblatt Securities had a buy rating for the stock and raised its price target from $120 to $135. Rosenblatt also cited a “new server product” that will help the company double in size in the coming years. Further, at CNN Business, 29 analysts have given AMD stock a median price target of $110. That’s a nearly 30% upside from its current price.
Bottom Line
By now, it should be evident that investors have nothing to worry about with AMD stock. This name is only going upward and it will hit triple digits soon. The company has even outshined Intel.
On top of that, the demand for AMD’s products should be consistent and strong over the next decade. The company beat analyst estimates in its last earnings report and is expected to do the same next quarter. Considering everything, this pick is well-priced and will generate solid returns in 2021.
So, investors shouldn’t ignore this opportunity to invest in AMD before it hits a new high.

2021-02-21 00:00:00+00:00,Better Buy: Western Digital vs. Intel Corporation,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/better-buy%3A-western-digital-vs.-intel-corporation-2021-02-21,,,"Western Digital (NASDAQ: WDC) and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) both provide crucial components for PCs, servers, and other electronics. WD is one of the world's largest producers of platter-based HDDs (hard disk drives), NAND flash memory, and NAND-based SSDs (solid-state drives). Intel is the world's largest producer of x86 CPUs for PCs and servers.
Both companies have faced intense headwinds over the past few years. WD struggled with sluggish demand for its legacy HDDs and declining memory chip prices. Intel struggled with severe chip shortages and delays, which enabled its smaller rival AMD (NASDAQ: AMD) to increase its market share.

Both companies also switched leaders throughout their struggles. WD's CEO Steve Milligan retired last year, handing the reins over to Cisco's former networking chief David Goeckeler. Intel's CEO Brian Krzanich resigned in 2018 due to an inappropriate relationship with an employee, and was succeeded by his CFO Bob Swan -- who was recently replaced with VMWare's former CEO Pat Gelsinger.
Over the past three years, WD's stock declined about 20% as Intel's stock rose more than 35%. Investors seemed to have more faith in Intel, but is it still a better investment than WD today?
Western Digital's declines are bottoming out
WD's revenue rose just 1% to $16.7 billion in fiscal 2020, which ended last July, as the double-digit growth of its data center business barely offset its declining sales to other markets.
Its gross margin contracted as the declining margins of its HDD business offset the rising margins of its flash business amid stabilizing NAND prices. As a result, its full-year adjusted EPS fell 37%.
In the first six months of fiscal 2021, WD's revenue fell 5% year-over-year to $7.9 billion as pandemic-related disruptions and the delay of a big cloud deal offset its stronger sales to PC makers. Its gross margin expanded thanks to higher NAND prices, and its adjusted EPS rose 40%.
WD expects its three core businesses to stabilize, and analysts expect its revenue to dip 4% for the full year before growing 15% next year. They expect its adjusted earnings to dip 3% this year before more than doubling next year -- assuming the pandemic passes and NAND prices continue to rise.
Micron's latest earnings report, which offers a rosy outlook for the NAND and DRAM markets, supports that bullish thesis.
Intel faces a murkier future
Intel's chip shortage, its market share losses to AMD, and the ongoing delays at its 7nm node all kept the bulls at bay over the past year.

Intel's growth initially seems stable. Its revenue rose 8% to $77.9 billion in fiscal 2020, which ended last December, and its adjusted earnings grew 9%. But its gross and operating margins contracted, and it relied heavily on buybacks to boost its EPS.
Its sales of data center chips dipped year-over-year in the third and fourth quarters due to COVID-19 headwinds and sluggish spending from government, enterprise, and cloud customers, and nearly offset the stable growth of its PC chips as more consumers bought new PCs for remote work, online learning, and video games.
The road ahead looks even murkier. Intel's foundry remains far behind TSMC (NYSE: TSM), which manufactures chips for AMD and other fabless chipmakers in the ""process race"" to create smaller chips, and Gelsinger is resisting calls to follow AMD's lead and outsource all of its production to TSMC.
As a result, analysts expect Intel's revenue to decline 7% in 2021 and stay nearly flat next year. They expect its earnings to tumble 11% this year as Intel ramps up its spending to resolve its production issues, and rise just 2% next year.
The dividends and valuations
WD suspended its dividend last May, and it probably won't resume those payments until its business stabilizes. Intel didn't touch its dividend during the crisis, and it still pays a forward yield of 2.3%.
Both stocks are cheap: WD trades at just 11 times forward earnings, while Intel has a forward P/E ratio of 13. Yet WD arguably deserves a higher multiple, since it's closer to a cyclical trough than Intel -- which will likely experience a significant downturn this year.
I'm not a fan of either stock right now, especially when there are more appealing tech stocks to buy. But if I had to choose one over the other, I'd stick with WD, because its declines are bottoming out. Meanwhile, Intel must prove it can fight back against AMD after being pinned against the ropes for far too long.

The semiconductor company's loss of its technical leads as well as management turmoil have soured many investors on the company. However, amid lackluster revenue growth and uncertainty regarding the role of its fabs, two factors have emerged that could make Intel stock an eventual winner.
Image source: Getty Images.
1. Leadership change
Leadership has become an ongoing problem for Intel. The sudden resignation of former CEO Brian Krzanich over a relationship with an employee brought in Bob Swan to the helm in 2018. However, Swan's expertise lay in finance instead of engineering, leaving Intel with no strategy to regain its technical edge.
Still, even with the company's bleak situation, Intel could forge a comeback -- thanks in part to the Feb. 15 arrival of Pat Gelsinger as CEO. Gelsinger has amassed more than four decades in the tech industry as both an engineer and a manager. He spent 30 of those years at Intel and most recently served as the CEO of VMWare. Gelsinger helped to design Intel's original 80486 processor before serving as the company's first chief technology officer, all of which might give him an advantage in knowing what Intel needs to again become competitive.
However, Gelsinger faces an uphill battle. Intel once dominated rival chipmaker AMD (NASDAQ: AMD) but has since lost its technical lead. It must now also play catch-up to NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA), which has become a competitor in recent years. In the past, Intel achieved and reinforced this dominance through the ""tick-tock"" cycle. It improved its overall chip-building process in ""tick"" years while crafting upgrades to the chips themselves during ""tock"" years. However, when Intel lengthened that cycle beyond two years, improving chips more slowly than its competitors, its harder-working rivals gained a technical lead.
Nonetheless, investors should not rule out an Intel revival. In recent years, AMD CEO Lisa Su has taken her company to the cutting edge after many industry observers left it for dead. This shows that such a comeback is far from impossible, especially since Intel remains a sizable presence in its industry.
Still, investors will have to exercise patience. According to an interview with CNN Business, Su told AMD's clients in the early days of its recovery that she would not have anything for them to look at for three years. Since chip designs typically occur in three-to-five-year cycles, investors should likely expect the same for any Intel recovery.
Gelsinger will also have to bolster confidence in the company's financials. Although it still posts almost eight times as much revenue as AMD, Intel financial performance has continued to suffer. The pandemic allowed revenue to rise 8% in fiscal 2020, as employees' shift toward working from home fueled a temporary increase in demand for computers and chips. Nonetheless, Intel's Q4 2020 revenue fell 1%, slightly lower than the 2% annual revenue growth during fiscal 2019.
Additionally, Intel's P/E ratio stands at about 13. Such a low multiple may appear inexpensive, but the higher valuation the market has awarded the company's peers -- 45 for AMD, and 41 for Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE: TSM) -- suggest that investors lack confidence in Intel.
2. National security
Despite this stagnation, Gelsinger could foster another advantage for Intel due to one overlooked factor -- national security. Intel operates eight of the 20 semiconductor fabrication plants, also called fabs, in the U.S., according to the Congressional Research Service.
Nonetheless, according to the Semiconductor Industry Association, the U.S. share of chip production has fallen to less than 13%, well short of the 47% of global demand claimed by the U.S.
Additionally, under former CEO Swan, Intel showed an inclination to follow its competitors by contracting out to outside fabs based primarily in foreign countries. Fabs such as those operated by Taiwan Semiconductor -- TSMC for short -- and Samsung manufacture chips for companies like AMD and NVIDIA. Moreover, Intel allocated $14.3 billion in capital expenditures in 2020, down from the $16.2 billion spent in 2019 -- spending less on company facilities as it outsourced more of its operations.
However, Gelsinger wants to take Intel in a different direction. On the Q4 2020 earnings call, he expressed an interest in reviving Intel's foundries, which served as the basis for its successes in past decades. This could help allay one key concern about the U.S. chip industry. TSMC and Samsung primarily operate foundries in or close to China, making their fabs potential targets should relations between the U.S. and China deteriorate.
To this end, the entire semiconductor industry has called on the Biden administration to provide subsidies for U.S. manufacturing research. The federal government has not yet approved such an outlay. Still, should the chip industry receive such a subsidy, Intel's size suggests that it would become one of the larger beneficiaries, which would give the company the funding it needs to catch up to its peers.
Where this leaves Intel stock
Currently, Intel trades at a low P/E ratio driven by lackluster revenue growth. Nonetheless, Intel now has an engineer with a management background at the helm. Though investors will not know for years whether Gelsinger's vision will bring about a recovery, Intel has hired someone who could potentially restore its competitive edge.
Moreover, Intel's main competitors' previous advantage -- the ability to manufacture chips at lower costs, in more modern facilities located primarily in Asia -- could become a vulnerability. If Intel can capitalize on subsidies to improve its foundries in the U.S., this tech stock could become a winner for patient investors.

2021-02-18 00:00:00+00:00,Apple adds 'BlastDoor' security feature to fight iMessage hacks,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/apple-adds-blastdoor-security-feature-to-fight-imessage-hacks-2021-02-18,,,"By Stephen Nellis
Feb 18 (Reuters) - Apple Inc AAPL.Ohas added a security feature across its operating systems to battle hacks into its devices that rely on incoming iMessages, it said on Thursday.
The ""BlastDoor"" feature processes incoming iMessage traffic and only passes on safe data to the rest of an Apple device's operating system, company officials said in a briefing.
Starting in 2016, a team of former U.S. government intelligence operatives working for the United Arab Emirates hacked into the iPhones of activists, diplomats and rival foreign leaders, Reuters reported in 2019.
Using a sophisticated spying tool called Karma, which relied on a flaw in Apple's iMessage system, they accessed iPhones without requiring the targets to click on anything to establish a connection. A new wave of attacks last year used similar tools to target journalists at Al Jazeera.
While largely invisible to users, BlastDoor is present on iOS 14, the most recent version of Apple's iPhone operating system, and systems for all its other devices, company officials said.
Apple held the briefing around the release of its annual security guide for cybersecurity researchers.
The latest update included new details on how many security features long found in iPhones are being brought over to Apple's Mac computer line, which in November began to integrate custom-designed processor chips after more than a decade of relying on Intel Corp INTC.Oprocessors.

Feb 18 (Reuters) - More than a dozen business groups representing automakers, medical device makers and manufacturers sent a letter to President Joe Biden on Thursday calling on him to work with U.S. lawmakers to provide federal funding for the construction of new chip factories.
The groups, which include the U.S. Chamber of Commerce as well as industry-specific associations representing General Motors Co GM.N, Caterpillar Inc CAT.N and Medtronic PLC MDT.N, among others, sent the letter as a shortage of semiconductors continues to disrupt U.S. automobile factories and threatens to lower the automakers' profits by billions of dollars.
A group of chipmakers last week sent a similar letter. Congress authorized programs last year to provide subsides for chip research and factory construction, but U.S. lawmakers still need to provide specific funding for the program.
""To be competitive and strengthen the resilience of critical supply chains, we believe the U.S. needs to incentivize the construction of new and modernized semiconductor manufacturing facilities and invest in research capabilities,"" the business groups wrote in their letter on Thursday.
The majority of chip production, especially for advanced computing chips, now occurs in Asia, where major contract manufacturers such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC) 2330.TW and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd 005930.KS handle production for hundreds of different chip companies. Both TSMC and Samsung are planning new U.S. chip factories in the next few years that could benefit from the program if it is funded.
In addition to funding existing programs, the business groups also called for an ""investment tax credit"" that could help defray the cost of semiconductor manufacturing tools, which can cost billions of dollars for new factories and typically far outstrip the cost of buildings.
American toolmakers such as Applied Materials Inc AMAT.O, Lam Research Corp LRCX.O and KLA-Tencor Corp KLAC.O dominate the industry, though Netherlands-based ASML Holding NV ASML.AS and Japan's Tokyo Electron Ltd 8035.T are also major players in some segments.

2021-02-17 00:00:00+00:00,Here's the Blue-Chip Stock Cathie Wood's ARK Invest Just Panned,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/heres-the-blue-chip-stock-cathie-woods-ark-invest-just-panned-2021-02-17,,,"The universe of exchange-traded funds has grown into a multi-trillion industry, with most of that money passively invested in various stock indexes. Lately, though, active ETF pioneer ARK Invest and its chief investment officer, Cathie Wood, have taken center-stage with amazing performance for the fund company's five top-performing ETFs.
ARK Invest just shared its latest report on its biggest and best investing ideas for 2021. The report included 15 different topics on which Wood and her fund company weighed in, ranging from electric vehicles and 3-D printing to next-generation gene therapy and digital wallets. It praised the business models that dozens of companies are following to early success.
Yet in the 112-page report, there was only one company that ARK Invest specifically called out as anything but successful. It's a well-known stock in a key industry, but in the report's words, it ""seems frozen in time"" and ""seems to have lost its way."" Below, we'll look at that stock and what its story means for its more promising competitors in this hot market area.

Bearish calls on today's buggy-whip sellers
To be clear, there are several industries that ARK Invest indicated are in danger of being disrupted. Just as buggy-whip sellers lost their business when cars replaced horse-drawn carriages, major companies in these industries could see tough times ahead. They include:
Traditional brick-and-mortar banks and other financial institutions, whose saving, lending, and brokerage businesses are losing market share to digital wallet providers that are expanding beyond simple cash management to encapsulate a wide range of financial services.
Makers of gasoline-powered automobiles and trucks, as electric vehicles gain traction across the industry.
Legacy players in labor-intensive industries that fail to embrace the widening availability of automated solutions.
But the one company the report mentioned by name was Intel (NASDAQ: INTC). In an era in which data centers have never been more important to innovation, the premier chipmaker and members of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES: ^DJI) could lose the franchise that has made it a household name since the 1980s.
Falling behind
ARK Invest argues that data centers have had to reinvent themselves at regular intervals, largely in response to technological advances. The last major shift came in the 1990s, when Intel took the knowledge it had gained in developing PC microprocessors and applied it to data center. The transition took time, but over the past 20 years, Intel supplanted legacy data center players to take commanding market share above 90% by 2020.
Now, though, Intel has run into massive operational challenges. After years of being on the cutting edge of technology in the semiconductor area, Intel has recently delayed production of 10-nanometer processor chips. Meanwhile, other companies, such as Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM), have produced 7-nanometer and even 5-nanometer chips.
Going forward, ARK Invest believes that Intel-architecture chips will give way to ARM-based processors, potentially grabbing 80% of the market within the next decade. With cloud-services giant Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN) having launched an ARM-based processor last year, Intel's technology could be in the same place now that mainframe computers occupied when Intel was in its heyday.
Intel's moment of truth
For its part, Intel is still confident in its ability to catch up and remain a leader in the semiconductor space. Incoming CEO Pat Gelsinger believes that Intel will still be able to produce cutting-edge chips in-house rather than having to turn to third-party foundries.
It's notable, however, that Wood and ARK Invest chose to spend as much time as it did in its report on why Intel's fortunes appear to have turned for the worse. It stands as a lesson that even top blue-chip companies aren't invulnerable to disruption. Moreover, it will have investors watching closely to see if AMD, Taiwan Semi, and Amazon continue to make progress in the data server space at Intel's expense in the years ahead.

Shares of CF Finance Acquisition III (NASDAQ: CFAC) were trading lower on Wednesday after the special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) announced that it has struck a deal to merge with lidar maker AEye.
As of noon EST, CF Finance Acquisition III's shares were down about 17.1% from Tuesday's closing price.
So what
Here's the background. California-based AEye was started in 2013 by Luis Dussan, an engineer who had worked for years on targeting systems for military fighter jets. Of note, these are artificial intelligence-based systems that have to be able to see, identify, and respond to objects very quickly.
Dussan (now president and chief technology officer) and his team have applied that kind of thinking to lidar-based systems for cars. AEye's offering isn't just lidar hardware, it's a whole machine-learning sensor system that is designed for vehicles using advanced driver-assist systems and (in time) autonomous vehicles as well.
In another intriguing twist, AEye is partnering with (rather than competing with) top-level auto industry suppliers, notably German giant Continental AG, which will in turn sell AEye's systems to automakers.
Image source: AEye.
Here are the high points of the deal itself.
The deal will raise $455 million in gross proceeds for the post-merger company (which will retain the AEye name.) That includes $230 million from the SPAC, and another $225 million from a private investment in public equity (PIPE) fund.
The PIPE's investors include venture-capital arms of General Motors (NYSE: GM), Subaru (OTC: FUJHY), Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), and German auto supplier Hella GmbH, along with some other investors that weren't disclosed.
AEye's existing investors include Continental, LG Electronics, and the venture-cap arms of Japanese auto supplier Aisin Seiki (OTC: ASEKY) and aircraft giant Airbus (OTC: EADSY).
The deal values AEye at $2 billion.
Now what
Assuming all goes according to plan, the deal is expected to close by the end of June. Investors in the SPAC will own 13% of the combined company (a decent percentage) after the deal closes. The PIPE investors will own 9%, and existing shareholders -- all of whom plan to retain their shares -- will own the remaining 79%.
So why is CF Finance Acquisition III's stock down today? It could be this simple: 13% of $2 billion is $260 million; as of noon, the SPAC's market cap was about $329 million. Auto investors might be adjusting their holdings accordingly.

2021-02-17 00:00:00+00:00,Advanced Micro Devices Trades at Near Perfection,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/advanced-micro-devices-trades-at-near-perfection-2021-02-17,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) has been on a tear in the last year. AMD stock is up 74% in the past year. But recently, year-to-date it is up only 2% or so. The market is not as enamored with it as in the past. I suspect that AMD stock is probably fairly valued now, despite its good growth prospects.
Source: flowgraph / Shutterstock.com
Earnings per share (EPS) are forecast to rise 30% this year, after moving up more than 32% last year. AMD stock trades for 49 times this year’s EPS and 37.5 times next year. This is despite analysts’ estimate of 30% growth in both years.
In other words, a good deal of good news is already in the stock price at the Feb. 12 price of $93.77.
Supply Shortage
AMD’s CEO Lisa Su estimates, according to Barron’s, the present supply shortage could last through the first half of 2021. It has arisen as a result of a glut of orders coming from all sorts of manufacturers from automakers to video game console manufacturers.
A big portion of AMD’s growth comes from its specialty in gaming console chips as well as its enterprise server chips. AMD said demand grew from the current versions of the Sony and Microsoft consoles. In addition, its server revenue grew on a sequential basis.
7 Stocks That Elon Musk Loves – And That You Should Too
Therefore, the chip shortage implies that the company has guaranteed revenue growth for at least the next six months. It serves to solidify analysts’ forecasts.
On the other hand, they can’t sell more than their existing capacity to produce. So, in another sense, its growth expectations, at least in the near term, will be maxed out.
AMD Valuation Assumes Perfection
There is another way to look at how high AMD stock is really at. In the latest financial report, the CEO said its outlook was for 37% revenue growth in 2021. That would bring it up to $13.375 billion, up from $9.763 billion last year.
However, assuming its free cash flow (FCF) margin stays roughly the same at 8%, FCF will be $1.07 billion.
Let’s look at that further. AMD stock has a $113.6 billion market cap at the $93.77 price. This implies that its FCF yield is a super high multiple of 1.0%. This is seen by dividing $1.07 billion by $113.6 billion market value (actually 0.94%).
If the market values a company’s FCF by more than 100 times (i.e., an FCF yield of 1.0%), it assumes almost a perfect outcome. Any kind of hiccup in the company’s growth prospects could hurt the valuation.
What to Do With AMD Stock
The Motley Fool points out that AMD has been clobbering Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) in terms of market share in the semiconductor market.
AMD’s market share was 21.7% of the overall x86 processor market (including desktops, laptops and server processors), according to the Fool. Although this was lower than in Q3, it is still substantially higher than a year ago. That was when it was at 15.1% at the end of Q4 2019.
Some market observers note that with the launch of AMD’s new Ryzen 5000 laptop processors, it could pick up to 50% of the notebook market. That would bring its overall market share even higher and above where it was in Q3 (22.4%). Moreover, Intel seems to be actively losing market share with its poor chip performance.
Therefore, the market may yet come back to raise AMD’s valuation even further. This assumes earnings and cash flow surprise on the upside.
Investors may find that holding on to their shares, despite the poor performance of AMD stock this year, is the best move. If analysts see more gains in its market share over Intel, the stock could move higher.
However, new investors considering taking a stake might want to wait for weakness. This is possibly due to its valuation which is at or near perfection.

Of course, doing so will involve taking on some risk, and it's fair to say that the stock market is looking volatile.
With that in mind, we asked three Motley Fool contributors to profile a hot, high-flying stock that they believe investors should stay away from right now. Read on to see why they think backing GameStop (NYSE: GME), Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA), and Sundial Growers (NASDAQ: SNDL) with your stimulus money would be a bad move.

Don't try to recapture the magic
Keith Noonan (GameStop): The comeback rally for GameStop over the last year has been nothing short of incredible. The otherwise struggling retailer's stock started to rise following excitement about new video game consoles from Sony and Microsoft. It got another boost with news that Ryan Cohen, founder of the successful pet-focused e-commerce platform Chewy, was buying shares and taking an activist role in pushing the business to focus on online retail.
What happened next is a story for the history books. Individual investors coordinating on Reddit's WallStreetBets board and other internet social hubs noticed that some firms had placed huge bets against GameStop, and that buying of the stock could trigger a short squeeze that would result in the company's stock price skyrocketing.
GameStop went from trading at roughly $4 per share a year ago to trading as high as $483 per share at the height of the recent short-squeeze mania. Shares have recently pulled back substantially and are now trading in the $50 range, but investors seeking more explosive gains shouldn't pile into the stock with the hopes that it will enjoy another huge rally.
The short squeeze momentum that drove the stock's incredible gains appears to have dissipated and would be difficult to recapture even if investors coordinating online attempted to make another push. GameStop's incredible rally delivered huge wins for those who got in on it early, but the stock still trades up roughly 1,150% over the last year -- and all without much evidence of progress on its big e-commerce turnaround play.
Sometimes it's best to admire a flashy story from a distance instead of waiting for the chance to try to write yourself into it. There are plenty of other growth opportunities to be found in fast-developing markets including cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and augmented reality investors will probably be, and I think most investors will be best served by avoiding GameStop at this point.
Tesla's competition-free era is coming to a close
James Brumley (Tesla): Tesla revolutionized the automobile industry. CEO Elon Musk's company wasn't the first to make a successful electric vehicle, but it was the first to make them cool.
Rivals are finally responding. General Motors is planning to offer 30 different battery-powered cars by 2025, and Ford Motor says it's going to invest $22 billion in its electric vehicle effort by the end of the same year. A slew of other carmakers are also making respectably sized splashes on the EV front. Of course, none of them seem positioned to catch up with Tesla following what can only be described as a breakout year. In 2020 the company's top line grew 28% to $31.5 billion, prompting a swing to a profit of $721 million. Given that the EV powerhouse is now viable, the 400% run-up Tesla shares have seen over the past 12 months is perfectly understandable.
The fact is, however, the rally has carried Tesla shares to a valuation suggesting competitors won't eventually make a dent in its dominance. Big mistake.
We've certainly seen the market underestimate budding competition in the past. Take Cisco (NASDAQ: CSCO) as an example. It was all the rage in the late '90s when networking solutions were in demand and few other options existed. Like other tech names, Cisco shares struggled in 2000's dot-com crash and then began to recover in 2002. But the stock still hasn't revisited its early 2000 peak price. Newcomers such as Juniper Networks and Aruba stepped up their games in the meantime, preventing Cisco from reestablishing the sort of dominance it enjoyed a few years before. Intel is another name that's still not back to its all-time high reached in 2000 despite more than a decade's worth of sustained forward progress. Advanced Micro Devices and NVIDIA were both around 20 years ago, but both became much tougher competitors for Intel now. Never say never.
And if you need some numbers to flesh out the idea, the stock's presently priced at 31 times sales -- not earnings, but sales -- versus the S&P 500's current price-to-sales ratio of 2.8. Even giving the company a valuation pass based on trailing earnings while it's still growing, shares are still trading at an outrageous 67 times 2025's per-share earnings consensus of $12.03. And that's an estimate from analysts also struggling to grasp how much demand new electric vehicles from other makers may get once they become available.
None of this is to suggest Tesla is doomed, or that it won't remain the EV market leader for the foreseeable future. It'll survive, and probably thrive. The stock's valuation completely ignores budding competition, though, setting the stage for a pullback sooner or later. Reality always (eventually) trumps hype.
Don't fall for the pot craze
David Butler (Sundial Growers): If you're looking to put your stimulus check into the market, you need to decide whether you're investing or gambling. If you're investing, don't get pulled into the fray of speculation around cannabis stocks.
We watched most of the publicly traded cannabis stocks go wild in the last few weeks, as a Democratic-controlled U.S. government has drawn more speculation for a legalized U.S. market. That doesn't mean you should go and gamble your $1,400 stimulus check on it. We've watched names like Sundial Growers soar 250% this week. The stock has become part of the Reddit retail trader craze, and is rather lacking in financial fundamentals to support the run. In the third quarter of 2020, the Canadian cannabis producer lost 71.39 million Canadian dollars.
Overall, Sundial Growers hasn't had a year of profitability as a public company. Recently, it saw attention for its offering to raise $74.5 million. In the release, the company said it had CA$610 million in unrestricted cash after that offering. That cash gives the company some ammo, but it still doesn't seem like the best name within the sector. The larger names are garnering most of the market share. Moreover, the sentiment on a legalized U.S. market doesn't not mean that Canadian companies will be the ones to prosper. It just means that traders can create hype.
If you want to use your stimulus check to get involved in the cannabis industry, look at something like Canopy Growth (NASDAQ: CGC). Like most names in the cannabis industry, it has seen its fair share of financial losses, but its connections with Constellation Brands give it a long-term connection to the U.S. market. Constellation invested billions into the company, and could potentially take it over down the road. It now has its former CFO running things. If you really want to lower risk, invest in Constellation Brands itself.
Don't gamble your stimulus check. As evidenced by the 20% fall in Sundial Growers' shares on Thursday, these kinds of trades can just as easily turn against you.

It’s common knowledge that investing in undervalued stocks can generate some juicy returns over the long haul.
However, the tricky part is investing in the right stocks at the right time. Investors often favor certain sectors over others and undervalued stocks tend to be in the latter category.
Although 2021 is shaping up to be a bull cycle, there are still plenty of stocks trading below their value. Investors looking for a value play should consider buying these stocks as these gravitate towards the prices they are worth.
8 Cheap Stocks Under $20 That Could Double
Here are three stocks that should be in for greater upside this year.
Ford (NYSE:F)
IBM (NYSE:IBM)

In the Ford versus General Motors (NYSE:GM) wars, GM comes out on top this year for its recent venture into the autonomous vehicle space. However, there is plenty of evidence to prove that Ford is in a great position to close the performance gap in the coming months.
One key tailwind is Rivian, the electric truck manufacturer. In 2019, Ford announced a minority stake in the electric truck start-up which is worth $28 billion. Although the company is yet to generate sales, its first vehicle is expected to come out later this year. This could bolster Ford’s bottom line as well.
Adding to its partnership with Rivian, Ford is also expected to develop a line of electric vehicles in-house. In 2020, the automaker started distribution of its Mustang-Mach E and deliveries of the electric F-150 truck will begin this year.
Ford has a market cap of just $45 million with free-cash-flow (FCF) of $3 billion. At this ratio, Ford is among the top undervalued stocks in the market. Under the hem of its new CEO Jim Farley, the company is primed for a major comeback this year.
IBM (IBM)

For the period ended in December, IBM stock took a hit after the company reported some poor quarterly results.
A major reason for the 6% dip in revenue (year-over-year) was its slow adoption of cloud-based solutions. As expected, the Q4 earnings resulted in a massive sell-off bringing its share price back to March 2019 lows.
Although this should deter investors from throwing their support behind the stock, IBM’s future prospects make it a great investment at its current price.
For one, IBM’s recent transition to cloud solutions gives the company plenty of opportunities to grow in the coming years. According to CEO Arvind Krishna, hybrid cloud computing will be a $1 trillion opportunity for the company. This along with developments in artificial intelligence (AI) will translate to higher revenue levels in the second half of this year.
Given the positive trends, I think IBM remains one of the most undervalued stocks on the market right now. Investors should get behind the investment before prices go higher.

Another company that’s had a tough run this year is the chipmaker Intel.
During its earlier than expectedearnings call CEO Pat Gelsinger stated that the company will continue to manufacture its chips in-house. This came as a disappointment to many investors who were hoping the company would outsource the manufacturing to improve internal efficiency.
The news overshadowed Intel’s earnings, which beat analyst estimates on both revenue and earnings per share. Although the reaction to the earnings was a mixed bag there are still plenty of reasons to hold on to Intel stock.
Intel stated that it will not outsource the production of its chips but there is a possibility it could do so for its other line of products like GPUs. As far as CPUs go, keeping the production of this in-house is capital intensive and could very-well lower its market competitiveness.
However, there is good reason to believe that it can catch up to rivals like Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), an emerging leader in the space.
Last month, Intel introduced a new line of processors that will hit the market this year. As CPU sales spike, Intel will be able to capture a greater share of the market this year. Intel definitely has its challenges but in the grand scheme of things, the company has numerous opportunities to come out on top in 2021.

Although the seasonal strength for Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is coming to an end, the computer chip giant has strong prospects ahead. The company posted strong fourth-quarter results and continued to par debt levels. Strong chip demand across the board should give AMD stock a lift in 2021.
Source: Akura Yochi / Shutterstock.com
AMD’s solid sales performance reaffirmed the bull run in the last few years. In the fourth quarter, its free cash flow growth and debt reduction are notable accomplishments. AMD posted FCF of $480 million, up from $400 million last year (per slide 30). It lowered its debt by a wider margin, from $486 million in Q4 of 2019 to $330 million in the last quarter. At this pace, the company could be debt-free in three quarters.
AMD does not need to hurry in paying its debt. Interest rates are low and show no signs of rising. Still, it has 7.5% senior notes due in 2022 worth $312 million. In its growth phase, it is better off spending on marketing and sales efforts to promote its suite products.
Growth Across All Divisions
AMD posted revenue growing by 37% to $1.96 billion from its computing and graphics unit. Strong demand for its Ryzen processor family lifted desktop CPU sales. Its chip refresh, which features Zen 3 in the Ryzen 5000 processors, achieved strong sell-through.
CEO Lisa Su said that the sell-through is more than double the launch quarter sales of any previous generation of Ryzen chips. This implies that not only will chip sales accelerate in 2021 but future refreshes will speed up the pace of sales.
8 Cheap Stocks Under $20 That Could Double
In January, AMD launched Ryzen 5000 mobile processors at Computer Electronic Show 2021. The chip will power a wide range of laptops. This includes commercial, gaming, and ultrathin models. By introducing useful features, such as a 23% higher performance than past models and 17.5 hours of battery life, expect unit sales to grow.
EPYC the Breadwinner for AMD Stock
AMD’s Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom segment revenue almost doubled, up 176% year over year to $1.28 billion. Upgrades from the cloud and enterprise markets lifted demand for AMD’s EPYC server processor. The strong demand more than offset the ongoing underperformance in the company’s graphics division.
Radeon graphic card sales will probably continue to lag that of Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). Nvidia has better marketing for its latest GPU. It also invests heavily in software device driver development, so customers rarely have any glitches. Conversely, AMD cannot slip up on software quality for its GPUs.
For now, AMD may lean on the improving visibility for its third-generation EPYC chip. It may leverage its deep customer relationships. Thanks to solid customer confidence, a shorter product testing time is speeding up server chip sales.
Fair Value
16 out of 23 analysts have a “buy” rating on AMD stock. The average price target is $107.52, according to Tipranks. Readers may forecast a conservative annual revenue growth rate. In a 5-year discounted cash flow EBITDA exit model, the following input projection would imply a fair value of $95 for AMD stock:
Fiscal Years Ending 20-Dec 21-Dec 22-Dec 23-Dec 24-Dec 25-Dec
Revenue 9,763 13,400 16,750 22,613 30,527 39,685
% Growth 45.00% 37.30% 25.00% 35.00% 35.00% 30.00%
EBITDA 1,681 2,412 3,015 5,653 10,684 7,143
% of Revenue 17.20% 18.00% 18.00% 25.00% 35.00% 18.00%

Rising average sales prices will help AMD’s profit margins in the server business. Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is struggling to keep up with AMD for now. If that changes and Intel wakes up, AMD need not worry. It is not competing only on price. Instead, it is competing on the overall value of the product offering. Corporations seek the lowest total cost of ownership without sacrificing on performance. They will keep picking AMD’s chips over that of Intel.

New York (Reuters Breakingviews) - Concise insights on global finance in the Covid-19 era.
-------------------------------------------------
UPDRAFT. Dan Loeb's hedge fund, Third Point, returned more than 20% last year for investors in its flagship Offshore Fund, Loeb said in a letter to investors on Wednesday. Third Point has made activist bets on huge corporations like Walt Disney and Intel and managed to avoid dangerous short exposure, but it got a big assist from an investment in startup Upstart.
The consumer loan firm went public in December at $20 a share, and its stock more than doubled by the end of the year. Loeb first invested back in 2015, and Breakingviews calculations based on disclosures in his letter and Upstart's prospectus suggest Third Point turned a total $70 million-odd investment into well over $500 million by Dec. 31. The share price has since more than doubled again.
Another Third Point-backed fintech lending outfit, SoFi, is helping too. It's selling itself to a special-purpose acquisition company, and the SPAC's shares have almost doubled since the deal was announced last month. Loeb can thank both for a good start in 2021.

NEW YORK, Feb 11 (Reuters) - The Nasdaq and S&P 500 eked out modest gains on Thursday with investors betting on more fiscal stimulus, but U.S. President Joe Biden said China was poised to ""eat our lunch,"" a warning that tempered enthusiasm for a market near record highs.
Nvidia Corp NVDA.O rose 3.2% and Intel Corp INTC.O 3.1%, making technology .SPLCRT the only sector on the S&P 500 and Nasdaq to rise, with all others declining. Declining shares outnumbered gainers on the Nasdaq and New York Stock Exchange.
Biden told a group of U.S. senators in a meeting to discuss the need to upgrade U.S. infrastructure that the United States must raise its game in the face of the challenge from China.
The warning about China and Democrat plans to include raising the minimum wage to $15 in a $1.9 trillion stimulus package showed headwinds for investors could be on the rise, said Ed Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA in New York.
""Markets are starting to get a little bit nervous over the relations between the West and China,"" Moya said.
Biden's first call late Wednesday with China's President Xi Jinping ""resurfaced all of the difficulties that we're going to face this year in addition to the pandemic,"" he said.
The Democrats also are not in agreement on where they stand on the minimum wage, he said. ""This is dragging out stimulus talks.""

The number of Americans filing new applications for unemployment benefits were 793,000 last week, compared to 812,000 in the prior week, but they are well below the record 6.867 million reported last March when the pandemic hit the United States.
Wall Street's main indexes have hit record highs recently on prospects of the $1.9 trillion relief bill that aims to jump start the U.S. economy, while a largely better-than-expected earnings season also has bolstered sentiment.
Analysts now expect fourth-quarter earnings for S&P 500 firms to grow 3%, versus a 10.3% decline forecast at the beginning of January, per Refinitiv data. Stocks are trading with high multiples, raising fears the market is overvalued.
""The market is certainly fairly valued. I don't see the overall market as horribly overvalued,"" said David Trainer, chief executive of New Constructs, a research firm in Nashville, Tennessee ""There are pockets of stocks, we call them micro bubbles, that are extremely overvalued.""

Semiconductor giant Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) finished off the year in style with another excellent quarter. AMD stock wowed Wall Street with yet another earnings beat posting huge gains across various verticals. Guidance for the first quarter and full-year 2021 looks impressive, and has been boosted by multiple growth tailwinds.

Despite the strong forecasts, AMD stock is down 5% for the month, which presents an excellent buying opportunity.
Tech giants are notorious for inflated stock prices. Based on several price metrics, AMD would probably fall into that same category. For instance, its forward price to sales ratio exceeds the sector average by over 86%. However, AMD’s gains are mainly driven by healthy revenue growth and improving financials.
The company’s five-year average revenue growth is at an incredible 13.01%, which comfortably exceeds the sector average. Average price targets for the stock are at least 10% higher than its current price. Hence, AMD’s price is more than justified at this point, and the recent dip is the cherry on top for investors.
AMD Stock: Capping Off a Great Year
AMD ended the year with a bang, with another quarter of health gains across its top and bottom line. Revenues for the quarter were up 53% year-over-year, 10% higher than analyst estimates. The quarter’s impressive growth was driven by Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom segment, which rose 176% year-over-year. Additionally, its Computing and Graphics segment was also up 18% from the same period last year. All in all, revenues for the full year were up 45% to $9.76 billion.
7 Must-Own Stocks in February
Earnings per share came in at 52 cents, beating analyst estimates by 5 cents. The company’s bottom-line was boosted by a $1.3 billion income tax benefit. For the full year, non-GAAP EPS was at $1.29, which is more than double the 64 cents it reported in the prior-year period.
These fantastic results have helped beef up the company’s financial positioning. Not long ago, the company was carrying massive debt, burning truckloads of cash each year. That, however, is a thing of the past, as its free cash flows jumped half a billion dollars over the prior-year period.  It ends the year with approximately $2.3 billion in cash against just $330 million of debt.
The first quarter of 2021 looks promising, with revenues expected to rise by a whopping 79% year-over-year. For the whole year, it expects a 37% growth in its business.
Intel Versus AMD
Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) has been head and shoulders above its competition in the semiconductor business for several years now. However, in recent years, we have seen AMD’s ascension, which continues to chomp away at Intel’s market share. AMD is winning big in the fast-growing server and gaming markets and expanding its market share in related areas.
Moreover, with its Ryzen processors’ release, AMD has become a force to be reckoned with in the central processing unit (CPU) space. AMD now controls roughly 39.8% of the markets, having just a 20% share back in 2018. AMD’s Ryzen 5000 series, according to independent benchmarks, is much superior to Intel’s equivalent.
Intel has regained some ground in the fourth quarter, primarily due to improving CPU capacity. Intel’s advantages over AMD are that it produces its chips in house using its internal foundry. However, capacity shortages should not last long, and neither will the pandemic-induced boom in demand. Therefore, market share gains should resume for AMD once chip supply shortages ease up.
Final Word on AMD Stock
AMD has been on an incredible run in 2020, and ended last year in stellar fashion. It has multiple growth catalysts in 2021 and should pick up from it where it left off last year. Though it ceded some market share to Intel in the fourth quarter, it should regain most of its lost ground as supply shortages ease up. With immense growth potential in 2021, AMD stock is a no-brainer investment at this time.

2021-02-11 00:00:00+00:00,Bumble Blasts Higher in Nasdaq IPO; Semiconductor Stocks Rake in the Chips,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/bumble-blasts-higher-in-nasdaq-ipo-semiconductor-stocks-rake-in-the-chips-2021-02-11,,,"The Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) has been able to rise lately even when the broader stock market hasn't fared as well, and Thursday proved to be no exception. Despite seeing losses briefly, the Nasdaq bounced back to a tiny gain at 1:15 p.m. EST, and was up about 0.25%.
Even with broader declines, several popular stocks found themselves moving higher. Foremost among them was Bumble (NASDAQ: BMBL) as it began trading for the first time on the Nasdaq after its initial public offering overnight. Meanwhile, semiconductor stocks showed strong gains that helped to minimize the damage on the Nasdaq from weakening market sentiment on Wall Street.
All abuzz about Bumble
Shares of Bumble opened for trading around midday, with the first trade taking place at $76 per share. That's only a bit above where the stock was at 1:15 p.m. EST.
Bumble runs a popular dating app that offers an alternative to Match Group's (NASDAQ: MTCH) Tinder and other competing apps. Bumble founder and CEO Whitney Wolfe Herd actually co-founded Tinder, and her motivation for Bumble was to answer a simple question: ""What if women made the first move, and sent the first message?""

The appetite among investors for Bumble stock has been insatiable. At first, the company sought to sell 34.5 million shares at between $28 and $30 per share. Bumble then raised its target to between $37 and $39 per share. In the end, the IPO went out at $43, with an outsize offering of 50 million shares.
With today's jump, Bumble is coming onto the market with a capitalization of around $15 billion to $20 billion. That's a lot, but it's less than half the $45 billion that Match Group sports, and bullish investors hope that Bumble will catch up and surpass its rival in the near future.
Chipping away
Elsewhere, semiconductor stocks were generally higher on the day. Giants like NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) saw muted gains of around 2%. But other stocks saw bigger rises, including 7% boosts for Lam Research (NASDAQ: LRCX) and KLA (NASDAQ: KLAC) and gains of 4% for Micron Technology (NASDAQ: MU).
Semiconductor stocks have been on the upswing for quite a while now, as the trend toward accelerated digital transformation has increased demand for computing equipment and the components that go into it. Indeed, some major customers have had to idle their own production efforts because of a shortage of necessary semiconductor chips for essential systems and applications.
That's good news for companies around the industry. For chipmakers, the payoff is obvious, as they can charge higher prices for commodity chips like memory and also get strong demand for launching new products. Moreover, for semiconductor equipment manufacturers, the high price environment is profitable for selling foundry equipment to help chipmakers boost their production to take advantage of high demand.
Long-term investors should be aware, though, that semiconductors tend to be cyclical in nature. Once chipmakers boost their production capacity, prices fall, and that in turn can lead to supply gluts and the inevitable downward phase of the industry business cycle.
For now, though, semiconductors are riding high. As long as demand for mobile devices and other tech remains strong, that's a trend that's unlikely to change.

2021-02-11 00:00:00+00:00,Buy AMD as It Can Crush Intel Again in 2021,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/buy-amd-as-it-can-crush-intel-again-in-2021-2021-02-11,,,"Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) has come out on top in its fight against Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) for the x86 processor market in 2020, according to the latest market share numbers from Mercury Research.
Though there has been noise of Intel gunning for a comeback as its market share climbed in the fourth quarter of 2020 on a sequential basis, AMD investors need not be worried. The chipmaker looks all set to expand its market share further in 2021. Let's see why.
AMD dented Intel badly in 2020, and it isn't done yet
AMD exited the fourth quarter of 2020 with 21.7% of the overall x86 processor market (including desktops, laptops, and server processors) under its control. Intel commands the remaining market share. This is lower than the 22.4% share AMD held at the end of the third quarter but substantially higher than the 15.1% share it held at the end of the fourth quarter of 2019.
Image source: Getty Images.
So, Q4 2020 was a big win for AMD as its x86 market share increased more than 7 percentage points as compared to the year-ago quarter. Chipzilla's market share increased just 70 basis points sequentially. What's more, Intel's quarter-over-quarter gains pale in comparison to what AMD achieved during the year.
Mercury Research adds that AMD gained 6.2 percentage points of the x86 processor market on an annual basis in 2020, while Intel lost 3.7 percentage points. It may not be long before AMD reclaims the small market-share loss it incurred last quarter for a few simple reasons.
For instance, AMD lost 1.2 percentage points in market share (on a quarter-over-quarter basis) to Intel in the notebook processor space last quarter. But it is in a solid position to bounce back after the launch of its latest laptop processors. One of the reasons why that may happen is because the new Ryzen 5000 laptop processors are expected to be deployed in 50% more notebooks as compared to their predecessors.
AMD had announced its Ryzen 5000 mobile processors in January this year, and the first laptops based on those chips have started rolling out already. So, Intel will have reasons to worry as more Ryzen 5000-based laptops hit the market.
Meanwhile, AMD lost just 80 basis points (quarter over quarter) in market share to Intel in the desktop processor space. There are two reasons why this happened. First, the chipmaker saw a huge spike in demand for its latest desktop processors that reportedly outpaced supply, forcing vendors to sell older AMD chips.
One AMD executive pointed out in November last year that demand for the Ryzen 5000 desktop processors is exceeding supply, which doesn't seem surprising as they trumped Intel's offerings on the performance front. So, AMD had a supply problem, and Intel tried taking advantage of that by ramping up its output.
This is the second reason why AMD lost market share in desktops. But AMD investors need not be worried about this as Intel's gains were reportedly a result of higher shipments of lower-end CPUs (central processing units). AMD, on the other hand, seems to have given priority to its higher-end chips to milk higher margins. CEO Lisa Su pointed out on the latest earnings conference call that the supply constraints were in the ""low end of the PC market.""
Not surprisingly, AMD is enjoying stronger pricing power in the desktop CPU market while Intel's average selling price is retreating. AMD is working to bring more production capacity online (according to Tom's Hardware), so it should be able to reverse the small loss of market share in the desktop PC market in the future.
Don't miss the potential gains on offer
By now, it is evident that AMD's sequential market share loss was just a blip on the radar that has more to do with the launch timing of its latest laptop processors and a supply shortage.
At the same time, investors shouldn't miss the fact that AMD continued to take away share from Intel in the server processor market. It exited the fourth quarter of 2020 with a 7.1% share of server processors, up from 6.6% in the third quarter and 4.5% in the year-ago period. This market presents a huge opportunity for AMD, and it can take advantage of the same with an updated product line this year.
In all, AMD can get back to its market share winning ways sooner rather than later, which is why investors shouldn't let go of a great opportunity to buy the stock.
AMD data by YCharts
Shares of the chipmaker have lost ground of late, but that's a blessing in disguise as the pullback has made AMD stock more affordable. AMD is trading at just 44 times trailing earnings, way below its five-year average multiple of 134. And with the company on track to deliver a nice spike in revenue and earnings this year, now looks like a good time to go long on this growth stock.

2021-02-11 00:00:00+00:00,FOCUS-Huawei suppliers push to reverse Trump's last minute blows,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/focus-huawei-suppliers-push-to-reverse-trumps-last-minute-blows-2021-02-11,,,"By Alexandra Alper and Karen Freifeld
WASHINGTON, Feb 11 (Reuters) - Semiconductor firms are seeking extra time to appeal last-minute Trump administration moves to block sales to Chinese telecoms company Huawei HWT.UL, hoping against the odds that the Biden administration will reverse course, five sources said.
Several company executives who declined to be identified by name said they ultimately do not think the Biden administration will significantly soften the hard-line position. ""Everyone is deflated,"" said one company executive.
Billions of dollars of U.S. technology and chip sales to Huawei hinge on how the Biden administration applies export restrictions the Trump administration put in place.
The companies hope that, with more time to make their cases before an interagency panel and a potential policy shift, at least some of the rejected Huawei sales will be allowed.
The U.S. Commerce Department did not respond to requests for comment. A Huawei spokeswoman said the company does not have any insight into the licensing process at the agency.
Days before Republican President Donald Trump left office on Jan. 20, the administration notified Huawei suppliers, including chipmaker Intel CorpINTC.O, that the government was revoking certain licenses to sell to Huawei and intended to reject dozens of applications for others, Reuters reported. L1N2JS0G3
The surprise flurry of ""intent to deny"" notices were among last-minute, tough-on-China moves aimed at boxing Democratic President Joe Biden into hard-line policies against Beijing and cementing Trump's legacy.
Among the decisions, the Trump administration denied 116 license applications worth $119 billion and approved four worth $20 million, according to a Commerce Department document dated Jan. 13 and seen by Reuters. Another 300 applications with stated values of $296 billion were pending, the document said.
Some companies whose license applications were rejected asked the Commerce Department for more than the standard 20 days to appeal their denials, the sources said. The department has granted 90-day extensions to some of the companies, the people said.
Huawei was placed on a trade blacklist by Trump in May 2019 over national security concerns after it was accused of being capable of spying on customers, as well as intellectual property theft and sanctions violations. Huawei has denied wrongdoing.
Before the January decisions, the U.S. government approved about $87 billion worth of applications for sales to Huawei and denied $11 billion since Huawei was blacklisted, according to the Commerce document.
'UNTRUSTED VENDOR'
The Biden White House has described Huawei as an ""untrusted vendor"" and a national security threat. Biden's nominee for commerce secretary, Gina Raimondo, pledged to protect U.S. telecoms networks from Chinese companies but declined to commit to keeping Huawei on a trade blacklist.
To remove the company from the blacklist, the Commerce Department would have to certify to Congress that Huawei has mitigated the national security threat it poses and that the firm has resolved charges of sanctions violations, according to a 2019 law.
""I don't think you will see a change in policy on Huawei,"" said James Lewis of the security think tank CSIS. ""I think (the Biden administration) is mainly signaling, 'We are going to do the same thing, but try to do it in a more business-friendly way.'""
The Biden administration is reviewing China policy, and sources say it is too early to know what path the president will take on Huawei.
Trump had an inconsistent approach to Huawei, opening the door to more sales when he was seeking a trade deal but then coming down harder as tensions began rising over the coronavirus and Beijing's crackdown on democracy activists in Hong Kong last year.
But few companies expected the big batch of rejections in mid-January, including license requests for chips used in 4G phones.
“Eventually, we determined if the item – it could be a memory chip or it could be something else – was capable of supporting a 5G application, then we denied it, even if it was not exclusive to 5G,” said former Commerce official Corey Stewart, a China hard-liner who joined the Trump administration in November and authored the Commerce document seen by Reuters.
