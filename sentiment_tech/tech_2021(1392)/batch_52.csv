*Stock Advisor returns as of September 17, 2021
Jason Hall: Marvell Technology, ticker MRVL. This is a company I'm trying to learn more about. Infrastructure semiconductor solutions. They reported late August. I just hit some of the high notes again here. Revenue just under 1.1 billion, up 48%. Reported GAAP gross margins of 34.6%. Adjusted gross margins of almost 65%. Lost $0.34 a share on a GAAP basis.
They said, well, adjusted we made $0.34 a share. There's a lot of things going on with Marvell. There's some acquisition activity that's happened. That makes the numbers a little complex. You have to think a little bit more broadly, and having some context on what's going on there I think would be would be super handy. Before we do that, though, I just want to talk about a couple of things I noticed on the balance sheet or in the operating statements.
I think it ties to what's going on with how the business has changed a little bit. That's costs. If you look at again at revenue, you go back a couple of years ago, you were looking at quarterly revenue, $650 million a quarter -- and now we're looking almost $1.1 billion because of goods sold over that time have more than doubled. Gross profit dollars are just about the same place they were. Nick, explain what's going on that's affecting it. Because that's where these adjustments the company is saying. That's where they come into play.
Nicholas Rossolillo: You hit the nail on the head with the acquisition comment you just made. A lot of M&A activity in the last few years in the semiconductor space -- Marvell's been, I'd say, a little above average in their aggressive stance in making acquisitions for big ones. In the last few years, they bought a company called Cavium a few years ago to get into the data processing unit space.
Just this year they acquired Inphi, and then most recently they announced that they are buying this other company called Innovium that does Ethernet switches for cloud computing data centers. Elevated expenses, most of it is them amortizing their acquisition costs. The acquisition is paid for already. They've either paid for it by issuing new debt or issuing new stock. But they amortize that expense over time. That's the difference between the GAAP losses and the non-GAAP earnings that Marvell has been reporting.
Clay Bruning: Yeah, I'd love to highlight a quick quote here and I think this alludes to how much they've benefited from the adoption of cloud in general and cloud computing. They noted that they're going to have strong sequential revenue growth in the third quarter thanks to strong data center performance.
Then they said they were going to have a significant step-up in revenue in the fourth quarter because of additional 5G rollouts and tailwinds related to 5G. Yes, they've been very acquisitive, but in my opinion, as someone who hasn't dove extremely deep into the business, it seems like they've been acquiring in the right places in terms of data center getting more cloud exposure. They've reduced their consumer exposure as well over the last couple of years. They are really starting to reap some of the benefits of the strong capital allocation in my opinion.
Rossolillo: Yeah, Clay. Just to tack onto what you just said. They said in the lastearnings call consumers now are like 15% of the business. Data center's now 40% of the business. They think data center will continue to grow beyond that as a percentage of their total revenue. It's a big opportunity. I think they've done a good job in making acquisitions in the right places to capitalize on that growth.
Bruning: Yeah. One more note on that, I was looking at some common-sized financials at the company to see how they've trended in terms of percentage of their revenue coming from data center versus consumer and all their newly touted segments. In the third quarter of 2019, which is their fiscal year 2020, 32% of revenue came from data center and 32% of revenue came from consumer. Fast-forward to the second quarter of this year, data center is up to 40%, and like you said consumers are half to about 16%. They're really concentrating their capital allocation and where they're focusing their sales, in my opinion, in the right places.
Rossolillo: Yeah. That's a dramatic jump. For sure.
Hall: Yeah. Just a couple of things I'm going to hit on here too. I think this is another just one of those examples of, if you look at the losses, you look at the operating results and then you have to look at cash flows as a separate thing because a lot of times when acquisitions happen, you take on certain expenses and a lot of times those things that show up are non-cash. They are tied to capital deployments, the money we spend, but they're not tied to a cash expense that happened that particular financial period.
That's really helpful to understand that. In general, this is a company that for a number of years is consistently generating a lot of positive operating cash flow. It's lumpy. [laughs] It's very lumpy. Then this is net income. That's the orange one. We haven't seen a lot of that operating cash. All the revenue growth, we haven't seen the revenue on here. There's the revenue growth. It hasn't translated so far to growth in cash flows. That's my question for both of you guys. I'll defer to both of you to respond, whoever wants to pick it up first. When is that going to happen? When are all of these acquisitions and driving out costs and ringing out efficiencies and all that stuff. When is the cash flow going to start following the revenue growth? Nick, go ahead.
Rossolillo: It takes a number of years. Amortized costs like that -- companies typically stretch that out over a 10-year period. They decrease over time, though. But on some of these acquisitions, they've been really good about showing how, yes, they're taking on some extra expenses, but on an adjusted basis, it's immediately adding to the bottom line when you back out the non-cash ongoing expense. The most recent one is Innovium that gets them into these switches that help control the flow of data in a cloud data center.
The current quarter, it's not going to do much. But by next year they said it's going to equate to added profitability. Two acquisitions within a year, we're just going to see some elevated expenses on a GAAP basis. But pay attention to the non-GAAP figure, the GAAP figure will converge with that over time, over the course of the next couple of years.
Bruning: Jason, I'm glad you brought up a risk, and we see, seemingly, painted a picture that everything is perfect with honestly the last couple of companies. This is a risk that I like to consider a lot with this specialty acquisitive businesses: execution risks. I haven't studied Marvell too closely. But if I were to take a look into this, the first thing I would look at is management's track record. Has the CEO digested acquisitions in the past? If so, have they been as large as some of the previous ones? If not, what went wrong, could that go wrong again? That would be my next step in terms of my research process. Look at management's track record. In terms of digesting and integrating acquisitions.
Hall: Yes. Sometimes it's the simplest way to grow in this area, but it's the hardest one to execute on well, because when you buy a company, you bring all that company's expenses along. You have a corporate culture of your own. Can you integrate the corporate cultures there? Which parts of that business can you squeeze out, push those expenses out and now cash flows get better. But how does that affect employees? How does it affect morale? Like there's all of those moving parts. Every acquisition you buy, you iterate that, you have to go through that exact same thing.

2021-09-26 00:00:00+00:00,3 Stocks We're Ready to Buy if the Market Crashes This Month,MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-stocks-were-ready-to-buy-if-the-market-crashes-this-month-2021-09-26,,,"Historically, the stock market crashes an average of once almost every two years (with a crash defined as a decline of 10% from highs). Stocks overall haven't suffered such a setback since the pandemic started a year and a half ago, so many investors worry that a 10% pullback is imminent.
The historical average is just that, though: an average. There's no telling when the market will crash and what will ultimately cause it to temporarily fall in value. But a focus on quality companies riding economic growth trends will set you up for long-term success no matter what the stock market does. Three Fool.com contributors think Marvell Technology Group (NASDAQ: MRVL), Duolingo (NASDAQ: DUOL), and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) are great buys right now, and would be especially great pickups if the market falls in the next month.
Doubling down on data center hardware
Nicholas Rossolillo (Marvell Technology Group): Semiconductor designer Marvell is flying high this year -- and not just because of the global chip shortage. The company has made four major acquisitions since 2018, and a fifth one is currently pending. These takeovers have transformed Marvell's operations, reducing its reliance on consumer electronics and upping its game in data centers and 5G mobile networks.
In fact, Marvell said on its lastearnings callthat data center sales (40% of revenue) are poised to grow for years to come. Marvell's product portfolio that spans data processing units (DPUs, the processors that manage the flow of data within a computing system) to optical and networking systems has helped Marvell increase its share of its customers' complex computing needs. And as cloud computing grows in importance in the decade ahead, Marvell is well positioned to grow.
There are risks, however, as Marvell integrates its various new chip design subsidiaries. But the semiconductor company is already realizing positive results. Net losses were $276 million in the last quarter on revenue of $1.08 billion, but on an adjusted basis the company generated a robust $284 million profit. The non-adjusted and adjusted bottom-line results will converge over time as the amortized costs of the acquisitions are digested.
At the end of the day, though, this is a top chip stock for the cloud computing age. The stock is up 140% since the start of 2020, and while I still like it for the long haul, I'd be really happy to load up on a lot more if it pulled back in price from all-time highs. Data centers are at the heart of modern business operations these days, and Marvell is helping make it happen.

Buy, compra, kaufe, achetez, köp Duolingo on the dips
Anders Bylund (Duolingo): Language tutoring specialist Duolingo is off to the races. The stock has gained a market-stomping 46% since joining the public stock market at the end of July. Trading at a lofty 37 times trailing sales with negative earnings and cash flows, Duolingo is a value investor's worst nightmare right now.
This little company is going places. I'm already a happy Duolingo shareholder and I'd be first in line to boost my holdings if another marketwide flight from high-priced growth stocks drags the stock back down. In fact, I might soon add a few shares to my holdings even if Duolingo stays aloft.
The language training platform you see today is only the beginning of a much larger ambition. Duolingo founders Luis von Ahn and Severin Hacker started the service with the vision that ""free education will really change the world."" That aspiration came first and the business opportunity followed much later, when von Ahn saw that voluntary donations and his MacArthur Genius Grant wouldn't be enough to let Duolingo change the world on a meaningful scale.
Foreign languages provide a solid training ground for Duolingo's online tutoring services in a more general sense, eventually paving the way for launches of similar services for subjects such as math, physics, history, and underwater basket weaving. Developing this grand vision will take years -- and it should be well worth the effort.
Theglobal marketfor online learning services added up to a $226 billion revenue opportunity in 2020. Duolingo collected top-line sales of just $208 million over the last four quarters, which works out to a 0.1% slice of the addressable market. The long-term growth opportunity is massive.
Furthermore, Duolingo is well equipped to make the most of this opening. It posted 47% year-over-year revenue growth in the company's first quarterly earnings report, and the balance sheet is squeaky clean with $115 million of cash reserves and just $8 million in long-term debts. It would take more than a temporary market storm to bring this company down.
So take advantage of lower prices if and when Duolingo's stock is dragged down by the next market panic. The company is poised to spread its wings and fly. If the lofty valuation is the only thing holding you back, you should be prepared to take action on the inevitable dips along the way.
A downturn in China could bring an opportunity in Apple
Billy Duberstein (Apple): iPhone giant Apple could get hit hard by aglobal marketsell-off, especially if the Evergrande crisis causes a recession in China. Last quarter, China accounted for more than 18% of Apple's revenue, and a broader China recession could also cause a global slowdown outside the U.S., especially with China's other trading partners in Europe and the rest of the Asia-Pacific region.
Of course, the last time Apple's stock was hit by Chinese worries was in late 2018 and early 2019. That proved to be a tremendous buying opportunity. In fact, Apple's stock has more than tripled off of that January 2019 bottom.
Data by YCharts.
That's because while iPhone sales can be inconsistent and lumpy, over the long run, Apple's revenue should grow. Eventually, customers need to update their phones, even if they hold off during difficult economic times, and Apple users are generally incredibly loyal. The Apple device installed base continues to grow every quarter, and management has successfully grown its services business, which has much more recurring revenue, to about 21.4% of total revenue as of last quarter.
It's true that Apple trades at a much higher earnings multiple than it did prior to 2020, and so its stock still has the possibility to fall significantly if the market gets scared. Yet its 28.5 P/E ratio today is still reasonable when considering its near-$200 billion cash pile, which should insulate this safe stock from any significant long-term danger.
And while Apple is primarily known for the iPhone and its various computing devices, it will also spend over $20 billion in research and development this year as it continues to innovate. Apple is likely to extend its brand power into future products and services going forward, such as healthcare, AR/VR, autonomous systems and vehicles, and others. Even recent new endeavors, such as Apple's controversial foray into streaming, could surprise to the upside. After all, the Apple TV+ show Ted Lasso cleaned up at this year's Emmy awards. That's the fastest any new streaming service has won the Emmy for best show. Therefore, investors shouldn't discount Apple becoming a more formidable force in streaming TV, either.
Basically, Apple is a cash-gushing, safe stock that still has a history of correcting in large market sell-offs. Given its consumer staple-like resilience and potential for future innovation, it's a prime target for investors should the market swoon.

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.

2021-09-15 00:00:00+00:00,Interesting MRVL Put And Call Options For January 2024,MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/interesting-mrvl-put-and-call-options-for-january-2024-2021-09-15,,,"Investors in Marvell Technology Inc (Symbol: MRVL) saw new options begin trading this week, for the January 2024 expiration. One of the key inputs that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 856 days until expiration the newly trading contracts represent a potential opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the MRVL options chain for the new January 2024 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $60.00 strike price has a current bid of $11.40. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $60.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $48.60 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of MRVL, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $62.25/share today.
Because the $60.00 strike represents an approximate 4% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 65%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 19.00% return on the cash commitment, or 8.10% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Marvell Technology Inc, and highlighting in green where the $60.00 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $67.50 strike price has a current bid of $12.10. If an investor was to purchase shares of MRVL stock at the current price level of $62.25/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $67.50. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 27.87% if the stock gets called away at the January 2024 expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if MRVL shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Marvell Technology Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing MRVL's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $67.50 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $67.50 strike represents an approximate 8% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 43%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 19.44% boost of extra return to the investor, or 8.29% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.
The implied volatility in the put contract example is 46%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 44%.
Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $62.25) to be 42%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

2021-09-14 00:00:00+00:00,"3 Futuristic Stocks for a 5G, Cannabis, and Metaverse World",MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-futuristic-stocks-for-a-5g-cannabis-and-metaverse-world-2021-09-14,,,"Getting in early on a growing company in a burgeoning market can turn $1,000 into $1 million, as some investors have experienced with Apple or Amazon. For those who might have missed out on the start of those two companies, the good news is that we're in the early stages right now in the 5G, cannabis, and metaverse markets.
The long-term potential for three companies in particular is enormous. While they operate in different sectors, Marvell Technology Group (NASDAQ: MRVL), Green Thumb Industries (OTC: GTBIF), and Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) share something that makes them excellent additions to any portfolio: For them, the future is now.
1. Marvell
As 5G technology penetrates its way into businesses and the lives of consumers, Marvell is establishing itself as an early leader specializing in data infrastructure networking and storage. Its networking products include application-specific integrated circuits, ethernet solutions, and processors, and it offers storage products such as fiber channels and storage processors. All of these products support growing demand in data centers, the automotive sector, and enterprise markets.
Image Source: Getty Images
In June, U.S. News & World Report highlighted Marvell, along with big-name competitors Broadcom and Qualcomm, as top 5G stocks to own in 2021. Leading research company Gartner (NYSE: IT) says the worldwide 5G network infrastructure market is on pace to grow 39% in 2021 on a year-over-year basis.
According to Bank of America, companies focused on wireless infrastructure are experiencing the early stages of a cycle that is expected to last for 10 years. This coincides with market growth projections by Grand View Research, which said that the global 5G services market, valued at $41 billion in 2020, will erupt at a compound annual growth rate of 46% through 2028. And the infrastructure market, valued at only $2.6 billion in 2020, is projected to outpace the overall services market with a 50% CAGR over the same time frame.
Marvell has had a busy 2021 thus far, with big announcements in each quarter. In March, it teamed up with Samsung to unveil a new system on a chip. The collaboration will support 4G and 5G networks simultaneously while enhancing 5G performance and cutting power consumption by up to 70% compared to previous solutions. The system will be used in Samsung's larger multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) radios for improved wireless communications.
A month later, the company completed its acquisition of Inphi, adding a high-speed electro-optics portfolio to improve connectivity for data centers and carrier networks. The company expects Inphi to expand its addressable market to $23 billion, while accelerating its CAGR to 12% on a year over year basis. Its previous five-year annual growth rate was just 1.72%.
Before the end of the second quarter, it announced a quarterly dividend of $0.06 per share to shareholders of record as of July 9, a yield of 0.5% -- unchanged since the fourth quarter of 2020. By comparison, the S&P 500's average yield is at less than 2%.
The dividend announcement was followed by another acquisition, that of Innovium, adding a portfolio of ""cloud-optimized switches"" that help expand its ethernet offerings. Innovium is expected to add $150 million in revenue in fiscal 2023.
All signs point to go for Marvell as it makes moves to be a leader in 5G technology now and in the future. It's feeding off record revenue of $1.07 billion in the second quarter, a 48% increase year over year and a 29% sequential improvement over the first quarter of this year. Record revenue was driven by strong sales in the data center market, where growth is expected to continue into the third quarter and beyond.
2. Green Thumb Industries
As we experience the 5G technology revolution, there is another industry that has its eyes on a future prize. The cannabis market has been growing exponentially throughout the U.S. over the past few years. Legal cannabis sales in the U.S. were up by 46% just from 2019 to 2020, hitting $17.5 billion in total.
Image Source: Getty Images
Leading the way in these state-governed markets is California, with $3.8 billion in 2020 sales, followed by Colorado at $2.2 billion and Illinois (the home state of Green Thumb) at just over $1 billion.
Green Thumb has been a strong contributor to these sales totals, benefiting from growing demand in Illinois and Pennsylvania in particular. As a multi-state operator that's vertically integrated, Green Thumb manages a full supply chain. It processes and distributes its products in 14 U.S. markets through 16 production facilities and 62 dispensaries, with licenses for an additional 49 retail locations.
Its second-quarter earnings report showed revenue growth of 87% for the six months ended June 30 on a year-over-year basis versus 2020, bringing its six-month revenue total to $416 million. The company also registered a fourth consecutive quarter of positive GAAP income, at $0.10 per basic and diluted share.
As of July, 19 states and the District of Columbia allow recreational-use marijuana. As more states adopt similar laws, there is a growing belief that ultimately it will be legalized at the federal level. If that happens, there might be a large group of investors wishing they had bought shares of this future leader.
3. Nvidia
It's extremely likely that you've used Nvidia's products, whether you know it or not. As a leader in artificial intelligence and graphics processing units, the company boasts a powerful line of products for several industries including gaming, engineering, supercomputing, and robotics. Its products are found in self-driving vehicles, data centers, hospitals, augmented and virtual reality devices, and predictive analytics, to name a few.
Image Source: Getty Images
What you might not be familiar with is the metaverse -- a term used for the future of Internet collaboration -- and Nvidia's role in creating a realistic interactive and collaborative collection of virtual 3D worlds. Supported by its RTX technology, Nvidia Omniverse provides a shared platform on which live collaboration takes place between users and applications with real-time speed and simulated reality. Examples might include interaction of users within video games, or perhaps attending a business meeting as a hologram.
The metaverse is expected to be the future of work and play, and an increasingly common aspect of our daily lives. Other companies with early involvement include Facebook, Roblox, Unity Software, and Microsoft. All of these except for Facebook are currently listed in the top 10 holdings of the Roundhill Ball Metaverse ETF (NYSEMKT: META), with Nvidia leading the way in asset weight at 8.7%, a full 3% asset weight higher than the second-ranked holding.
Nvidia stock has been on a tear lately, supported by second-quarter record revenue of $3 billion and a 4-for-1 stock split on July 20. But even after a year-to-date share price surge of 71%, it likely still has plenty of room to grow. The average analyst target is slightly above the current price of $223, but the high is $328, representing a potential 47% increase.
That might seem high after such big gains of late, but according to research firm Strategy Analytics, the global metaverse market is expected to reach $280 billion by 2025 -- six times its $46 billion value in 2020.
The future is now
Of these three companies, I'd consider Marvell and Nvidia no-brainer opportunities to make a lot of money in these burgeoning markets. As for Green Thumb, its footprint is expanding in a cannabis market that shows great promise, but it might be a bit riskier than Nvidia and Marvell. No one really knows if or when recreational-use marijuana will be legal federally. So the risk may be a bit greater in the marijuana stock, but the potential reward is outstanding, and the company has proved it can make money as a multi-state operator regardless of federal cannabis laws.

2021-09-08 00:00:00+00:00,"Nvidia seeks EU approval for Arm deal, decision due Oct. 13",MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/nvidia-seeks-eu-approval-for-arm-deal-decision-due-oct.-13-2021-09-08,,,"By Foo Yun Chee and Kate Holton
BRUSSELS/LONDON, Sept 8 (Reuters) - Nvidia NVDA.O on Wednesday sought EU antitrust approval of its $54 billion takeover of British chip designer Arm, according to a European Commission filing, with regulators likely to echo worries similar to those voiced by the UK watchdog last month.
The world's biggest maker of graphics and AI chips announced the deal last year, triggering concerns in the semiconductor industry over whether Arm could remain a neutral player licensing key intellectual property to customers and rivals.
Worried customers include Qualcomm Inc QCOM.O, Samsung Electronics Co Ltd 005930.KS and Apple Inc AAPL.O.
Arm customers Broadcom AVGO.O, MediaTek 2454.TW and Marvell MRVL.O are backing the deal.
""We are working through the regulatory process and we look forward to engaging with the European Commission to address any concerns they may have. This transaction will be beneficial to Arm, its licensees, competition, and the industry,"" Nvidia said in a statement.
It has previously said it would maintain Arm as a neutral technology supplier.
The EU competition enforcer can clear the $54 billion deal with or without concessions after its preliminary review or it can follow up with a four-month long investigation if it has serious concerns.
Britain's competition watchdog has warned that the deal could damage competition and weaken rivals, and required a further lengthy investigation.
Arm, owned by Japan's SoftBank Group Corp 9984.T, is a major player in global semiconductors, key to technologies from artificial intelligence and quantum computing to 5G telecoms networks. Its designs power nearly every smartphone and millions of other devices.

2021-09-08 00:00:00+00:00,Is Marvell Technology (NASDAQ:MRVL) A Risky Investment?,MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/is-marvell-technology-nasdaq%3Amrvl-a-risky-investment-2021-09-08,,,"The external fund manager backed by Berkshire Hathaway's Charlie Munger, Li Lu, makes no bones about it when he says 'The biggest investment risk is not the volatility of prices, but whether you will suffer a permanent loss of capital.' So it might be obvious that you need to consider debt, when you think about how risky any given stock is, because too much debt can sink a company. Importantly, Marvell Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRVL) does carry debt. But the more important question is: how much risk is that debt creating?
Why Does Debt Bring Risk?
Debt is a tool to help businesses grow, but if a business is incapable of paying off its lenders, then it exists at their mercy. In the worst case scenario, a company can go bankrupt if it cannot pay its creditors. However, a more frequent (but still costly) occurrence is where a company must issue shares at bargain-basement prices, permanently diluting shareholders, just to shore up its balance sheet. By replacing dilution, though, debt can be an extremely good tool for businesses that need capital to invest in growth at high rates of return. When we think about a company's use of debt, we first look at cash and debt together.
What Is Marvell Technology's Debt?
The image below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that at July 2021 Marvell Technology had debt of US$4.70b, up from US$1.44b in one year. However, it does have US$559.6m in cash offsetting this, leading to net debt of about US$4.14b.
NasdaqGS:MRVL Debt to Equity History September 8th 2021
How Healthy Is Marvell Technology's Balance Sheet?
Zooming in on the latest balance sheet data, we can see that Marvell Technology had liabilities of US$1.08b due within 12 months and liabilities of US$5.01b due beyond that. Offsetting this, it had US$559.6m in cash and US$785.6m in receivables that were due within 12 months. So it has liabilities totalling US$4.75b more than its cash and near-term receivables, combined.
Given Marvell Technology has a humongous market capitalization of US$50.7b, it's hard to believe these liabilities pose much threat. But there are sufficient liabilities that we would certainly recommend shareholders continue to monitor the balance sheet, going forward. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Marvell Technology can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.
Over 12 months, Marvell Technology reported revenue of US$3.5b, which is a gain of 23%, although it did not report any earnings before interest and tax. Shareholders probably have their fingers crossed that it can grow its way to profits.
Caveat Emptor
While we can certainly appreciate Marvell Technology's revenue growth, its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) loss is not ideal. To be specific the EBIT loss came in at US$40m. When we look at that and recall the liabilities on its balance sheet, relative to cash, it seems unwise to us for the company to have any debt. Quite frankly we think the balance sheet is far from match-fit, although it could be improved with time. For example, we would not want to see a repeat of last year's loss of US$371m. So we do think this stock is quite risky. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. However, not all investment risk resides within the balance sheet - far from it. These risks can be hard to spot. Every company has them, and we've spotted 2 warning signs for Marvell Technology you should know about.

2021-09-03 00:00:00+00:00,Why Marvell Technology Stock Can Shoot Higher,MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-marvell-technology-stock-can-shoot-higher-2021-09-03,,,"Marvell Technology Group's (NASDAQ: MRVL) fiscal 2022 second-quarter results turned out to be better than expected thanks to impressive growth across all of its business segments. The data center, carrier infrastructure, and the enterprise networking businesses stood out in particular, which wasn't surprising as Marvell is benefiting from a bunch of catalysts in these areas, such as the rollout of 5G networks, the need for faster networking solutions, and an increase in data center storage.
Marvell's guidance was also robust, indicating that it has more upside to offer.
MRVL data by YCharts
Let's look closely at Marvell's performance last quarter and see why this tech stock is built for further gains.
Marvell Technology Group's Q2 results point toward better times
Marvell's Q2 revenue increased 48% year over year to $1.08 billion, while adjusted net income increased to $0.34 per share from $0.21 in the year-ago period. The company's adjusted gross margin increased 150 basis points year over year to 64.8% during the quarter, helping Marvell comfortably beat the consensus estimate of $0.31 per share. Additionally, the robust demand across all of Marvell's end markets helped it exceed the midpoint of its revenue guidance and beat the Wall Street estimate of $1.07 billion.
Marvell expects $1.14 billion in revenue and $0.38 per share in adjusted earnings this quarter at the midpoint of its range. The company generated $0.25 per share in adjusted earnings on revenue of $750 million in the prior-year period. The substantial increases in management's guidance across the board indicate that Marvell is on track to deliver outstanding growth once again.

That's particularly true in the data center segment, which recorded 62% year-over-year revenue growth to $434 million and produced 40% of the top line. The chipmaker had spent $10 billion to acquire high-speed networking chip designer Inphi earlier this year to bolster its presence in the data center, 5G, and automotive markets.
When Marvell announced the Inphi acquisition in October last year, it pointed out that the acquisition will expand its addressable market to $23 billion. Additionally, Marvell said that Inphi would accelerate its addressable market's growth to an annual rate of 12%. Marvell is now witnessing tremendous momentum in the data center business, and the good part is that it expects the segment to pick up the pace through 2025.
Management points out that the company has scored ""significant design wins"" in the data center sector with multiple cloud customers. It also expects to win more market share in this space going forward. All of this is not surprising as Marvell is pursuing fast-growing opportunities in the data center market such as data processing units and data center interconnect.
The DCI market, for instance, is expected to clock an annual growth rate of over 12% through 2026 as per a third-party estimate. The DPU market, on the other hand, is another fast-growing niche that could become big in the long run. And considering Marvell's design wins could lead to more market share in the cloud computing space, the growth in its largest end market could get substantially better in the long run.
More reasons to buy
The carrier infrastructure market is another important growth driver for Marvell. It accounted for 18% of Marvell's total revenue last quarter, recording 39% year-over-year revenue growth. Management pointed out that the segment benefited from the ""ongoing deployments of 5G as well as product ramps at Samsung and Nokia."" Just like data centers, the carrier business is also on track to get better as Marvell has recorded new design wins to supply custom base station chips to three major telecom customers.
With 5G networks rolling out across the globe, Marvell's telecom carrier business is expected to step on the gas in the second half of the year. And, with demand for 5G infrastructure reportedly growing at 95% a year, Marvell's carrier infrastructure business could enjoy a long spell of high growth.
Thanks to all these tailwinds, analysts are upbeat about Marvell's prospects. They expect the company's earnings to grow at an annual pace of over 36% for the next five years and remain a top growth stock that could soar higher.

2021-09-02 00:00:00+00:00,7 Semiconductor Stocks to Buy for an Ongoing Chip Shortage,MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/7-semiconductor-stocks-to-buy-for-an-ongoing-chip-shortage-2021-09-02,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
If you’ve been paying attention to used car prices, you might have noticed that the sector has been on a yo-yo since the novel coronavirus upended our lives. During last year’s spring doldrums, many anticipated a recessionary slump hurting the secondhand car market. This year, though, prices have soared — and semiconductor stocks are potential key beneficiaries.
True, circumstances surrounding the global health crisis are uncertain. Right now, the mainstream media is focused on the delta variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which has seen a worrying rise in cases. While there’s always the possibility that the infection rate could burn out as with previous waves, you just never know with Covid-19. What we do know is that we’ve got to move forward. Unfortunately for those looking to purchase used cars, that can’t happen without the underlying commodities driving semiconductor stocks.
Unfortunately, one of the biggest contributors to the computer chip crisis is the industry’s supply drain. During the onset of the pandemic, chip-using businesses cut their orders to avoid holding inventory they couldn’t move. For instance, Harvard Business Review noted that “automakers cut their orders of all parts and materials — including the chips needed for functions ranging from touchscreen displays to collision-avoidance systems,” initially hurting prospects for semiconductor stocks.
Then “when demand for passenger vehicles rebounded, chip manufacturers were already committed to supplying their big customers in consumer electronics and IT,” Basically, automakers saw the writing on the wall and adjusted their inventory inflows — expect that the negative implications never arrived. Now, automotive firms are on the backfoot while used car prices and semiconductor stocks are jumping from unprecedented demand.
But when will this all end? Experts suggest that at the earliest, about nine or ten months from now. Others believe that we could suffer supply constraint into 2023. If so, waiting for those used car prices to drop may take longer than you think.

8 Tech Stocks to Buy Offering Solid Dividends
In the meantime, you might be better served putting your money to work with these semiconductor stocks to buy.
Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA)
Marvell Technology (NASDAQ:MRVL)
Analog Devices (NASDAQ:ADI)
Cohu (NASDAQ:COHU)
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM)
ASML (NASDAQ:ASML)
NXP Semiconductors (NASDAQ:NXPI)
Finally, do note that even if supply-demand pressures ease, it may not mean a catastrophic drop for semiconductor stocks. Remember, it’s going to take some time to fill the backlog across the entire supply-chain ecosystem. To continue the used car analogy, it’s not as if boatloads of cars are going to appear just because chipmakers are able to start feeding demand normally.
Semiconductor Stocks to Buy: Nvidia (NVDA)

If you firmly believe that the computer chip crisis will last for the better part of two years, then you might want to look into Nvidia. One of the powerhouse names among semiconductor stocks, there isn’t a technology-based industry that Nvidia isn’t somehow involved in.
For example, Nvidia is a household name among video gamers for its powerful graphics processing units (GPUs). Given the spike in gaming during the Covid-fueled lockdowns — which levered a positive societal impact, according to a scientific report — NVDA stock enjoyed a substantial catalyst. The company’s GPUs are also a fan favorite among cryptocurrency miners.
Obviously, cryptos have been soaring over the trailing year, bolstering the case for mining-centric semiconductor stocks.
But Nvidia is also a contributor to the electric vehicle rollout. According to a recent Scientific American article, that’s going to be a problem because EVs are heavily dependent on computer chips. Moreover, the delay places huge burdens on President Biden’s clean energy ambitions.
However this plays out, for now and for the foreseeable future, NVDA is a golden name among semiconductor stocks.
Marvell Technology (MRVL)

Specializing in data infrastructure innovations, Marvell Technology is incredibly relevant for enterprise-level digitalization needs, such as cloud computing and data centers. Further, Marvell’s financial performance reflects management’s strategic outlook.
Recently, the tech firm posted a solid beat for its second quarter results, posting adjusted earnings per share of 34 cents on revenue of nearly $1.08 billion. Covering analysts expected Marvell to deliver EPS of 31 cents on sales of nearly $1.07 billion. Against the prior-year comparison, earnings soared 62% while sales jumped 48%.
As CEO Matt Murphy stated, “Growth was driven by the data center, which now represents Marvell’s largest end market at 40% of total revenue, benefiting from our growing momentum in the fast-growing cloud infrastructure market.”
Curiously, MRVL stock sold off following the disclosure, with some analysts opining that expectations were set too high for Marvell. Nevertheless, this could be an opportunity to get a discount on one of the more relevant semiconductor stocks.

8 Tech Stocks to Buy Offering Solid Dividends
No matter how you break it down, data centers will play a pivotal role in commerce. Further, another Covid-related disruption will make this sector even more highly demanded.
Analog Devices (ADI)
ADI) sign outside of building"" width=""300"" height=""169"">

Despite its somewhat ironic name, Analog Devices is very much relevant to the digitalization needs of the modern business ecosystem. Specializing in data conversion, signal processing and power management technologies, Analog Devices core customers are found in the industrial, communications and healthcare segments.
Recently, Analog made another big splash as China’s regulatory agency approved its acquisition of Maxim Integrated Products (NASDAQ:MXIM). According to Investor’s Business Daily, “Every company that has significant exposure to the Chinese market — the world’s biggest for chips — must get approval from Chinese regulators when they merge with or acquire another company. The U.S., European Union and other markets have similar requirements.”
The approval is particularly important for the times that we’re living in. “San Jose, Calif.-based Maxim is strong in chips for the automotive and data center markets,” which bodes very well for ADI stock. As Scientific American pointed out, a series of production setbacks at pivotal chipmaking facilities have exacerbated the semiconductor supply problem, especially for the automotive industry.
Should the crisis impacting semiconductor stocks continue unabated, ADI could cynically stand to benefit.
Cohu (COHU)

With the massive impact of the coronavirus pandemic combined with the ebb and flow of uncertainty regarding when the chip shortage will fade, it pays for investors to take a wider view of semiconductor stocks to buy. This might be the tide to lift all boats, at least according to Rosenblatt Securities, which is bullish on Cohu
While not a household name like Nvidia, Cohu is nevertheless a critical part of the global semiconductor infrastructure. Focusing on testing and handing equipment to serve the world’s biggest chipmakers, the company has enjoyed an incredibly robust demand profile. Add to the fact that the automotive segment was Cohu’s largest during Q2 — accounting for 18% of total sales — and you have a compelling outlook.

8 Tech Stocks to Buy Offering Solid Dividends
Rosenblatt analyst Scott Graham recently reiterated a “buy” rating on COHU stock, setting a price target of $57. At the close of the August 27 session, COHU was priced at $35.27, meaning that prospective buyers may enjoy a nearly 62% upside if the bullish thesis pans out.
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM)

About a month-and-a-half-ago, Japan’s “Deputy Prime Minister Taro Aso said that ‘if a major problem occurred in Taiwan’, his country would ‘need to consider seriously’ that the neighbouring Japanese island of Okinawa ‘could be next’ in Beijing’s list of targets.” Labeling a hypothetical scenario where China invades Taiwan as an “existential threat,” Tokyo announced that it would join the U.S. in defending the small island nation.
While the prime minister was discussing Japan’s interests, CNBC issued a report noting “how much the world depends on Taiwan for semiconductors.” While it’s a scary thought that Taiwan is in the middle of a geopolitical firestorm, this broader narrative certainly bodes well for Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing.
For one thing, the company dominates the foundry market or the outsourcing of semiconductor manufacturing. Indeed, it’s the world’s largest foundry, serving household tech powerhouses like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) and Nvidia.
Second, its supremacy in the foundry field means that it really doesn’t have any competitors. While that poses geopolitical vulnerabilities due to the China threat, at the same time, Taiwan itself is an international partner no nation can afford to lose.
ASML (ASML)

While I’m not the biggest fan of buying semiconductor stocks — or any equity class — into strength, I might have to make an exception for ASML. Based in Veldhoven, Netherlands, ASML provides hardware, software and services to allow their enterprise-level clients to mass produce patterns on silicon, thereby facilitating groundbreaking innovations.
Further, investment management firm Polen Capital is a huge fan. In its Q2 investor letter, the organization wrote dotingly about ASML’s forward prospects:
Dutch technology company ASML is the world’s only supplier of photolithography systems to leading-edge semiconductor manufacturers. It is a gross simplification and a valid point to note that ASML’s technology enables the computing technology we use today. For years, ASML engineers bent the laws of physics and enabled Moore’s Law—which states that computer chips will become faster and cost less—to progress.
Incremental innovation gains mushroomed with the rollout of Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) technology. We were impressed by management’s recent acknowledgment that demand for ASML’s lithography systems is exceeding their prior expectations. Recent announcements by management and major customers for ASML give us even more confidence in the sustainability of growth. We believe ASML could grow its earnings at a high-teens rate over the coming five years.

8 Tech Stocks to Buy Offering Solid Dividends
Given how ASML stock has gained nearly 120% over the trailing year, it’s hard to argue against the optimism.
NXP Semiconductors (NXPI)

Specializing in mixed-signal chips for the mobile and industrial industries, along with Internet of Things applications, NXP Semiconductors has always been a relevant force among semiconductor stocks. But its true focus has been on the automotive market and this of course is where the narrative for NXPI stock goes truly bonkers.
On a year-to-date basis, NXP Semiconductors shares are up 40%, while over the trailing year, they’re up an incredibly robust 78%. But what’s really intriguing is that NXPI has seriously strong momentum over recent trades. For instance, between the July 28 and Aug. 27 session, the equity unit has popped up over 14%.
In my opinion, if you’re waiting for a good deal on a used car, you should prepare yourself to wait longer than you thought.
According to Michelle Krebs, an analyst with the car dealer conglomerate Cox Automotive, a projection for when the chip supply in the auto sector will improve is painfully ambiguous.
“The situation is very fluid,” the analyst said. “We thought it would be easing by now, and it seems to be just as bad and possibly worsening over the next few months. We’re trying to figure out when does it bottom out, and I just don’t have the answer for that.”
Again, bad news for car buyers but great news if you’re thinking about gambling on NXPI stock.

2021-09-01 00:00:00+00:00,We Did The Math QTEC Can Go To $184,MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/we-did-the-math-qtec-can-go-to-%24184-2021-09-01,,,"Looking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at ETF Channel, we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. For the First Trust NASDAQ-100-Technology Sector Index Fund ETF (Symbol: QTEC), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $183.52 per unit.
With QTEC trading at a recent price near $167.37 per unit, that means that analysts see 9.65% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of QTEC's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are Autodesk Inc (Symbol: ADSK), Marvell Technology Inc (Symbol: MRVL), and Texas Instruments Inc. (Symbol: TXN). Although ADSK has traded at a recent price of $310.09/share, the average analyst target is 13.75% higher at $352.71/share. Similarly, MRVL has 11.05% upside from the recent share price of $61.19 if the average analyst target price of $67.95/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting TXN to reach a target price of $211.53/share, which is 10.80% above the recent price of $190.91. Below is a twelve month price history chart comparing the stock performance of ADSK, MRVL, and TXN:
Combined, ADSK, MRVL, and TXN represent 7.38% of the First Trust NASDAQ-100-Technology Sector Index Fund ETF. Below is a summary table of the current analyst target prices discussed above:
NAME SYMBOL RECENT PRICE AVG. ANALYST 12-MO. TARGET % UPSIDE TO TARGET
First Trust NASDAQ-100-Technology Sector Index Fund ETF QTEC $167.37 $183.52 9.65%

Marvell Technology Inc MRVL $61.19 $67.95 11.05%
Texas Instruments Inc. TXN $190.91 $211.53 10.80%
Are analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past. These are questions that require further investor research.

*Stock Advisor returns as of August 9, 2021
As discussed during the prior quarter'searnings call we have implemented a change in how we report revenue. Starting with the second quarter of fiscal 2022, we have started to report revenue by five end markets. In our earnings press release we issued earlier today, we have provided historical and market revenue data by quarter starting with the second quarter of fiscal 2020. In this press release, we have also provided revenue results by product growth.
Going forward, we intend to only report revenue by end market. In today's call, Matt will comment briefly on our revenue performance by product group for the second quarter before transitioning most of his discussion through our results and expectations for each of our five end markets. With that, I'll turn the call over to Matt for his comments on our performance. Matt.
Matt Murphy -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Ashish, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with a summary of our second quarter GAAP results. Revenue was $1.076 billion, GAAP gross margin was 34.6%, GAAP operating loss was $267 million, and loss per diluted share was $0.34. Building on the strong results we delivered in Q1, our second-quarter results, which include a full quarter of Inphi, were equally robust, driven by strength in our diversified end markets and continued focus on operational excellence.
Revenue for the second quarter exceeded the midpoint of our guidance and grew 29% sequentially and 48% year over year. I am now going to review our non-GAAP results for the quarter. Non-GAAP gross margin was 64.8%, 80 basis points better than expectation. Non-GAAP operating expenses were lower than expected, and we delivered $331 million in non-GAAP operating income. Revenue, non-GAAP gross margin, and non-GAAP operating income were all record achievements for Marvell.
Higher revenue, coupled with stronger non-GAAP gross margin and lower opex, drove non-GAAP earnings per share to $0.34, $0.03 above the midpoint of guidance. Non-GAAP EPS grew 62% year over year. Our non-GAAP operating margin climbed above 30%, demonstrating significant operating leverage in our business model. In the second quarter, the stand-alone Marvell business delivered solid year-over-year revenue growth in the high teens on a percentage basis, similar to the growth rate we saw in Q1. I am also pleased with the strength of our Inphi business, which delivered revenue above expectations and was accretive to our non-GAAP earnings in its first full quarter within Marvell. On a product group basis, networking revenue was $702 million, above the midpoint of expectations, and grew 41% sequentially, and 73% year over year.
Storage revenue was $342 million, also above the midpoint of expectations, and grew 13% sequentially, and 18% year over year. Our storage business, which I would note does not include any contributions from Inphi, is now running at an annualized revenue run rate of approximately $1.4 billion. This business has been growing double digits year over year in recent quarters, reflecting its remarkable transformation from significant PC exposure to now being focused largely on the data center. Based on the significant improvement in the mix of end markets combined with design wins we have secured for SSD controllers, HDD controllers, and preamps, we expect our storage business to continue to grow strongly over the next several years. Let me now move on to discussing our five end markets. I'll start with a recap of the substantial improvements we have driven over the last few years in focusing the company on data infrastructure, which is evident in the historical data we have provided today.
As a result of our strategic multiyear transformation, we have significantly increased our exposure to the data center and carrier end markets, which are characterized by long product life cycles, sticky design wins, and multigenerational engagements. At the same time, we have substantially reduced our dependence on the consumer market, which tends to be more volatile with shorter product life cycles. The consumer market is now only 15% of our total revenue. Factors contributing to this change include significantly higher growth we have driven from the other end markets, our de-emphasis on PC, HDD, and SSD controllers, and the sale of our Wi-Fi business. In sharp contrast, data center is now our largest end market, and at 40% of total revenue is about twice as large as any of our other end markets.
We believe that data center is positioned to become an even bigger part of Marvell over time when we combine our growing market share with the numerous secular growth drivers in this end market. Over the last few years, data center has become our most diversified end market with revenue contribution from nearly every Marvell product line. Cloud is the primary growth driver in this end market, and it's exciting to note that cloud now represents more than half of our data center revenue, making cloud on its own larger than any of our other four end markets. We have grown our data center business through organic investment in our nearline HDD controllers and preamps, SSD controllers, as well as significant M&A. We added Cavium's LiquidIO and LiquidSecurity DPUs, which have been adopted by multiple cloud customers. The Avera acquisition added a custom ASIC platform, which we coupled with Marvell's leading standard product IP.
This has proven to be extremely compelling to hyperscale customers who are building custom hardware to deploy incredibly efficient and optimized infrastructure. We recently added Inphi's market-leading electro-optics portfolio for high-speed connectivity both within and between cloud data centers. Finally, the proposed acquisition of Innovium will add their cloud-optimized Ethernet switches to our data center portfolio of products. With the broadest technology platform in the industry, we believe Marvell is well-positioned to become a semiconductor leader in data center, and expect this end market will be the most important growth opportunity for the company over the next several years. In carrier infrastructure, we have been significantly growing our dollar content base station, winning new customers, and growing our overall market share in the 5G market. Just over the last two years, our carrier revenue has nearly tripled, representing approximately 20% of our total revenue.
We expect a sustained period of strong revenue growth from this end market, driven by an increase in 5G deployments, which are still on the early stage of worldwide adoption and the ramp of our full platform of 5G products and multiple customers in their current generation of base station. We have also won additional sockets in five nanometers, which will go into production next -- in next-generation base station launches over the next several years, extending the growth from our carrier end market over a long time period. The enterprise networking end market comprises approximately 20% of our total revenue. The revenue contribution from this end market has grown rapidly and kept pace with the strong growth in Marvell's total revenue over the last few years. This is a solid accomplishment against the backdrop of challenging end-market dynamics. In fact, over the last two years, our enterprise revenue has grown at 23% annual CAGR with the majority of the growth coming from stand-alone Marvell Ethernet switch Inphi products.
These refreshed platforms have been instrumental in driving outsized revenue growth, a testament to the competitiveness of our products and technology. We believe that we are well-positioned to continue outperforming the market, and are looking forward to a recovery in enterprise spending that would serve as an incremental tailwind to this business. Our revenue from the automotive and industrial end market has begun to accelerate in recent quarters, benefiting from the ramp in our auto Ethernet connectivity business. Our automotive business is in its early stages of growth. Given our design win traction and the growth expected in the adoption of Ethernet technology in cars, we expect the revenue contribution from this end market will become a larger portion of our total revenue over time. Let me now move on to discussing our second-quarter results and third-quarter expectations for each of our end markets starting with data center.
In our data center end market, revenue for the second quarter was $434 million, growing 57% sequentially, and 62% year over year. Strong growth was driven by contributions from the acquired Inphi business and ongoing growth from the stand-alone Marvell business. Cloud customers drove the vast majority of the growth in our data center end market. Our electro-optics products continue to benefit from the adoption of PAM-based connectivity inside cloud data centers, as well as the adoption of DCI, or data center interconnect, between regional locations.
Marvell's DPUs and storage products also contributed to growth in this end market. Last quarter, we discussed a number of significant design wins, leveraging our advanced technology platform with multiple cloud customers across a variety of applications and business models. These are expected to drive a substantial step up in our cloud revenue in the calendar 2024 to 2025 timeframe. Development is in full swing on these projects, and I am pleased to report that our cloud design win momentum continues this quarter with an additional custom ASIC design secured for a cloud networking application. We expect to continue to win sockets and gain share in this market, leveraging the strength of our portfolio, and growing engagements with key cloud customers. In our third fiscal quarter, we are expecting another strong performance from data center, projecting robust sequential revenue growth in the double-digits on a percentage basis.
We expect year-over-year growth will be considerably higher and project data center revenue to just over double from a year ago. We expect sequential growth to be driven by cloud with virtually all of our product lines contributing to growth. I am also pleased to note that in the third quarter, we expect to start ramping our second generation of COLORZ DCI products, 400-gig ZR into volume production. With our proposed acquisition of Innovium, we are looking forward to adding their cloud-optimized switches to Marvell's broad data center portfolio. We received very positive feedback from multiple key customers following our announcement of the planned combination.
They are excited about the prospect of collaborating more closely with us once the acquisition closes to address their need for high-performance switches going forward. Turning to our carrier infrastructure end market. Revenue for the second quarter was $197 million, growing 17% sequentially, and 38% year over year. In addition to the contribution from Inphi, year-on-year growth was enabled by a stand-alone Marvell's wireless business. Our wireless revenue growth was driven by ongoing deployments of 5G, as well as product ramps at Samsung and Nokia, partially offset by an expected decline in custom ASICs shipping into China.
Design win progress continues in 5G, and I am pleased to report that we have won a next-generation ASIC design, leveraging our five-nanometer technology platform within the radio unit at a key base station customer. With this win, we have now secured five nanometers design at three Tier 1 base station customers. Our O-RAN and vRAN platform, which includes our card-based Layer 1 accelerator, also continues to be adopted by multiple cloud customers and wireless base station OEMs. In the third fiscal quarter, we expect sequential revenue growth from the carrier end market, driven by strong growth from wireless, partially offset by a decline from wired. We project the strong growth in wireless in the double-digit sequentially and on a percentage basis to come from an increase in 5G deployments in multiple regions. In addition, we expect growth from 5G to significantly accelerate in the fourth quarter.
On a year-over-year basis for our carrier end market, we project strong revenue growth to continue above 20% in the third quarter. Moving on to our enterprise networking end market. Revenue for the second quarter was $223 million, growing 27% sequentially, and 41% year over year with the majority of the growth coming from stand-alone Marvell products. This remarkable level of organic growth in the enterprise end market was made possible in part by a strong effort from our operations team to address pent-up customer demand. While we expect strong demand to continue for the foreseeable future, we expect supply constraints will impact our ability to sustain this level of revenue attainment in the third quarter. From a product perspective, growth in the second quarter was driven by our Ethernet networking portfolio, benefiting from ongoing share gains and the beginning of multigig adoption.
We are also encouraged by strong demand for our products from customers that we believe indicator recovery is underway in this end market. Looking ahead to the third quarter, while we expect a sequential decline in revenue due to supply constraints, we anticipate strong year-over-year growth approaching 30%. Turning to our automotive and industrial end market. Revenue for the second quarter was $57 million, growing 24% sequentially, and 125% year over year, driven by the ongoing ramps in our auto business. Marvell continues to gain recognition from customers for its commitment to automotive-grade quality and reliability.
During the quarter, we received a prestigious Global Supplier Award from the Bosch Group in recognition of Marvell's outstanding performance and quality in the manufacture and supply of leading-edge data infrastructure semiconductors. We are looking forward to our continued partnership and long-term collaboration with Bosch on our broad and growing group of automotive customers and partners. Turning to the third fiscal quarter. We expect our revenue from the auto and industrial end market to grow sequentially. Year over year, we project growth will continue to be very strong and expect revenue to nearly double in the third quarter.
We also expect to attain an important milestone in the third quarter. Our automotive business is projected to cross over a $100 million annualized revenue run rate, earlier than the prior expectation. Moving on to our consumer end market. Revenue for the second quarter was $165 million, declining 1% sequentially, and growing 23% year over year. Most of the revenue in this end market is from stand-alone Marvell and the strong annual growth is driven primarily by our custom DIY SSD controllers.
Looking ahead to the third quarter, we expect revenue to grow sequentially while year-over-year revenue growth will remain strong in the double-digit on a percentage basis. In closing, we expect our business momentum to gather strength in the second half of fiscal year 2022. Our recent results and near-term expectations for revenue growth continue to trend above the high-end of our target model. Demand for our products continues to significantly outpace supply, and our global operations team is aggressively securing more capacity. We are working closely with our supply partners, leveraging our scale and balance sheet to improve our ability to win strong, secular growth and demand we expect for our data infrastructure products, both in the short and the long term. For our third fiscal quarter at the midpoint of guidance, we expect revenue to grow 6% sequentially and 53% year over year.
We expect growth from the stand-alone Marvell business to accelerate to over 20% year over year in the third quarter compared to the high teens we achieved in the first half. Additionally, we expect the Inphi business to continue to perform well and grow faster than stand-alone Marvell. Our integration of Inphi is proceeding very well and we successfully achieved our one ERP milestone ahead of schedule. Leveraging the larger scale and broader set of key technologies, the combined teams are working closely together on winning new opportunities at multiple Tier 1 customers. We are also looking forward to completing the proposed acquisition of Innovium, which will broaden our Ethernet switch platform and further increase our exposure to the fast-growing cloud data center market. I am also pleased to announce that we will be hosting our Investor Day this year on Wednesday, October 6, 2021 at 8:00 a.m.
Pacific. Similar to last year, this will be a virtual event, webcasted live on our website. We will provide more event details in a press release shortly. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jean for more detail on our recent results and outlook.
Jean Hu -- Chief Financial Officer
Thanks, Matt, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with a review of our financial results for the second quarter and then provide our current outlook for the third quarter of fiscal 2022. Revenue in the second quarter was $1.076 billion, $11 million above the midpoint of guidance. Networking represented 65% of our revenue with storage contributing 32%.
Revenue from other accounted for 3% of our revenue. As Ashish mentioned earlier, starting with the third quarter, we'll only report revenue by our five end markets to provide more transparency about the key growth drivers of our business. GAAP gross margin was 34.6%, which included amortization of Inphi inventory step-up cost. Non-GAAP gross margin was 64.8% of revenue, 80 basis points above the midpoint of guidance, primarily due to a better mix. GAAP operating expenses were $638 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $366 million, approximately $6 million below the midpoint of guidance, primarily due to faster-than-expected Inphi synergy achievement and disciplined opex management.
I am confident that our team will achieve the remaining Inphi integration synergies based on the plan we discussed last quarter. Given the significant growth opportunities ahead of us, we are turning our focus to ensuring continued investment to support our long-term profitable growth. As a reminder, our operating expenses can vary quarter to quarter affected by factors such as the number of tapeouts within a particular quarter, and these tapeouts are becoming more expensive in newer process geometry. The cadence of NRE payment, which we treat as the contra opex can also add variability. Our GAAP operating loss was $267 million.
Non-GAAP operating profit was $331 million, or 38.8% of revenue. For the second quarter, GAAP loss per diluted share was $0.34. Non-GAAP income per diluted share was $0.34. Now turning to our balance sheet. During the quarter, cash flow from operations was $222 million.
We returned $49 million to shareholders through dividend payment. Our long-term debt was $4.7 billion. Our gross debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 3.4 times, and net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was three times. Inventory at the end of the second quarter was $460 million.
We amortized $156 million of the Inphi inventory step-up cost in the second quarter due to purchase price accounting, and we anticipate amortizing the remaining balance of $17 million by the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2022. Now turning to our guidance for the third quarter of fiscal 2022. Please note this guidance does not include any contributions from the pending acquisition of Innovium. We are forecasting revenue to be in the range of $1.145 billion, plus or minus 3%. We expect our GAAP gross margin in the range of 46.3% to 48.3%. We project our non-GAAP gross margin will be in the range of 64% to 65%.
We project our GAAP operating expenses to be in the range of $584 million to $594 million. We anticipate our non-GAAP operating expenses to be in the range of $365 million to $370 million. We expect non-GAAP tax rate of 5%. We expect our basic weighted average shares outstanding will be 824 million and our diluted weighted average shares outstanding will be 841 million.
As a result, we anticipate GAAP loss per share in the range of $0.10, plus or minus $0.04. We expect non-GAAP income per diluted share in the range of $0.38, plus or minus $0.03. Operator, please open the line and announce Q&A instructions. Thank you.

We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] Our first question will come from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
John Pitzer -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst
Yeah. Good afternoon, Matt, Jean. Thanks for letting me ask questions, and congratulations on the solid results. Matt, relative to your enterprise commentary, you talked about supply constraints impacting the October quarter.
I'm wondering when you look at the overall business holistically, where are things relative to the supply side of the equation? Are you still unable to ship to full demand by sort of what amount? And earlier this week, there were some rumors in the popular press of the foundry guys raising pricing. I'm just kind of curious if you guys have embedded that into your gross margin guidance. And how you're thinking about kind of the current inflationary pricing environment, can you pass that on, or is that something that you can't pass on?
Matt Murphy -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Great. Thanks, John. So, with respect to enterprise, let me just frame it at the whole company level.
We are still carrying pretty meaningful levels of delinquency across all of the end markets as our business has accelerated in terms of topline growth, which we've been very pleased at. I guess the downside is that the demand has continued to grow. Well, I guess it's a good thing. The demand is growing faster than supply, but we need to catch up.
So, enterprise is impacted, but so are the other end markets. Although I would say given the complex nature of our networking products, there's -- we're carrying relatively more, you know, we're relatively farther behind there. We were pleased that we were able to have a strong performance in Q2 and catch up because, as you can see, there was a fairly meaningful step up in revenue. Most of that is coming from organic stand-alone Marvell. There is some contribution from Inphi, but it's not as -- you know, it wasn't large for Inphi.
So, this is all Marvell, and in fact when you look into Q3, in our guidance, that still implies a 30% year-over-year growth rate in enterprise. So, we could ship a lot more if we could get the products. And I think you could also view this as another sign that the enterprise business, which we had been saying a quarter or two ago could be a real tailwind for the company. This business is definitely picking up both at the end market and demand level, as well as our own design wins layering in.
So, we're going to be working hard to increase our revenues here and catch up on the delinquency. On the foundry side, and just in general with the pricing environment, I mean, as you recall, there was a lot of commentary at the end of last year and early this year from all the major semiconductor companies relative to the supply chain cost increases that have been occurring on an ongoing basis. And that's everything from foundry to backend to substrates. You know, we said earlier this year, we're able to work with our customers on that. And so, as you can see in our margin performance, we've been able to work with them to pass that on.
We've done that pretty fairly and in a neutral manner. I anticipate as we head into calendar 2022 that, you know, there will be additional increases across the industry and input costs. And I'm confident, as part of Marvell, we're able to work with our customers to, again, neutralize that impact. But the key focus we have right now, John, is planning our business together, focusing on long-term supply, and making sure that not only can we meet the short-term but also engage in multiple long-term agreements where we really have much stronger visibility to long-term supply. So, that's been the priority for us.
That's been the priority for our customers. And I think the pricing has been second at this point.

Our next question will come from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Ross Seymore -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst
Hi, guys. Thanks for letting me ask some questions, and echo that congrats on the results. Matt, I want to go a little bit into the carrier business. You talked in your press release about the 5G business accelerating in the third quarter.
And then taking this, I think, you've called it a significant step up again in the fourth quarter. Can you give us just a little bit of a ballpark, how much of your carrier business is that? What's driving that 5G step-up? And I guess this is kind of the deductive logic, what's driving the step down on the wired side implicit in your fiscal third-quarter guide?
Matt Murphy -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Great. Thanks, Ross. Yeah.
So, wireless has performed, you know, very well for us. Historically, as you recall, we had seven straight quarters of sequential growth in our 5G business. That took a pause this past quarter, which we had signaled with the China 5G digestion. And then on the positive side, you know, we see that business reaccelerating and growing in Q3, and then even more in Q4.
That's primarily on the back of new design wins that we had achieved several years ago, ramping into production, and those geographies that are being serviced through those are primarily non-China. So, that's really part of the -- now the global rollout, which we're well-positioned with our key customers there. So, it's a combination of global rollout plus new content kicking in, which we had been signaling for some time. So, that's all going well. The balance as you mentioned is wired.
That business historically wasn't terribly large for Marvell. We picked up some wired revenue from Inphi really in the coherent franchise, which does link in some ways to the growth of global data traffic. So, we feel good going forward about the wired portion, that's the Inphi piece. But in general, that business is lumpier.
That business also, you know, has pretty significant supply constraints around it as well. And so, you know, I'd say the traditional Marvell wired business isn't necessarily a growth business. The carrier business over time will be driven by the wireless portion, as well as some of the Inphi business. And just big round numbers, the wireless portion is roughly half the carrier number, and that will grow over time, obviously, as wired probably stays flattish without Inphi.
Inphi will grow, and then, obviously, the 5G rollouts will really be what's going to drive the carrier growth over the next few years.

Our next question will come from Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Vivek Arya -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst
Thanks for taking my question. Matt, you're guiding Q3 sales up by, I think, $69 million, $70 million, 6% or so. Is that really the absolute dollars of supply equivalent that is becoming available? And if that is the case, is that the range of supply dollars that could be available for the next several quarters? So, I know you're not guiding more than a quarter out. I'm just trying to get a better sense of how many supply dollars are kind of becoming available for the next handful of quarters because it seems like that is really what's going to get what we assume from a growth perspective for you over the next several quarters.
And I think part B of that on the 5G side, you know, you alluded to that 5G ramp in Q4, would that be incremental to that kind of supply available, or do you think that is kind of captured in those dollars? So, just trying to get a better sense for what the flexes on the supply side over the next handful of quarters. Thank you.
Matt Murphy -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Sure. Yeah. I mean, I think it's fairly straightforward in terms of how we think about the guidance and just the broader commentary that we gave, which very much comprehends the supply that we see available, you know, and we're obviously been pushing hard to increase that. And I would note, we have increased that.
If you look even going back to a year ago or more, even at the beginning of calendar 2020, we started growing the company double digits, and that growth rate for the stand-alone Marvell has actually accelerated, right? It was in the double-digit range, you know. Now, you get to the first half of this year. We had 17% kind of growth, both in Q1 and Q2 in the stand-alone Marvell business. We've said that that's going to pick up in Q3, right, more like 20% year over year, and we expect that we can continue going, you know, at that kind of rate. So, we've been actually accelerating our ability to get supply.
And then on top of that, we've got Inphi kicking in, which has also been able to grow their business meaningfully. So, you know, that's -- we've been signaling for quite some time to our supply chain that -- and our suppliers that we have needs and here they are. And so, you know, you should expect that we're going to keep working on that, we're going to keep driving the supply higher as available. You know, we've had, I think, a lot of productive discussions and negotiations with our key suppliers, not only for this quarter, next quarter but next year, and even beyond in terms of really lining up where we see our business heading. The advantage, I think, we have over some of the other industry peers perhaps is that our product life cycles, Vivek, in data infrastructure are very long.
These are typically five, sometimes seven-year life cycles, so we've got very good visibility. And so, we're in those discussions right now, both this quarter, next quarter blocking and tackling, as well as planning our calendar 2022, and then even planning out even farther with some long-term agreements we're putting in place. But just to circle back to the main question, yeah, everything we give you is centered around what we can actually supply. There's -- like I said, every one of our end markets, we could ship more right now if we could get the parts.

Our next question will come from Blayne Curtis with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Blayne Curtis -- Barclays -- Analyst
Hey, good afternoon, and thanks for taking my question, and thanks for the additional segment guidance. Just curious on -- you mentioned another cloud ASIC win, and that can span a lot of storage or DPUs, CPUs networking, and now maybe optical. So, I was wondering if you could give any color on that one, or maybe just in general, all these wins that you've had, you know, where you're seeing the most traction across several ASIC capabilities would be helpful.
Matt Murphy -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, sure, Blayne. Thanks. Yeah, I'd say that if I frame it more, you know, broadly as you mentioned the dynamic is that the ASIC and semi-custom wins that we're getting are across a broad range of applications. So, it's all the above.
They're everything from compute, ML, AI, networking, storage, and I'm pleased with the breadth, and it's across multiple customers, multiple applications. I believe in my prepared remarks, on the one that we just secured, was actually in the networking area. So, it's in a bunch of different applications. But it's all leveraging fundamentally, Blayne, the five-nanometer technology platform that we introduced in the summer of 2020, which is leveraging all of the high-performance standard Marvell IPs.
That's all going very well. And just as a side note on our five-nanometer programs are with multiple products now that have taped out this year, we actually have the first Silicon on five-nanometer coming back now imminently. And we're very happy with all the benchmarking performance, you know, etc. I'd also say that we're in a strong period of design win momentum, primarily because we introduced the platform in 2020. There's a whole range now of RFQs that we've been successful on closing on.
And that's not just in the cloud, by the way, we also noted we won an important 5G ASIC just recently. And even across some of our other end markets, we've also secured some very important programs on five-nanometer. So, yeah, so, I think over time, you know, what you'll see is a very diverse offering of cloud, set of custom and semi-custom sockets across multiple end markets and multiple applications.

Tore Svanberg -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst
Yes. And congrats on the record results. Matt, you mentioned that 400ZR is going to be ramping now. Is that which sort of Inphi's anchored customer, or are you starting to see ramps with multiple hyperscalers for that particular product? Thank you.
Matt Murphy -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. What I'd say, Tore, is on 400ZR, unlike the initial COLORZ product, which was primarily at one hyperscaler, you know, the engagements are much more broad with 400ZR. And so, you know, I'd say there are a number of different design opportunities and wins that are at various stages of trials, qualifications, and production ramps. But we anticipate that 400ZR will be multicustomer, multiyear, and a very important product cycle for Marvell.
But there is one primary customer ramping now, but it's going to continue beyond that.

Our next question will come from Harlan Sur with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.
Harlan Sur -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst
Good afternoon, and congratulations on the strong results and execution. As I look beyond Q3 and the growing demand profile for your products, right, combined with strong product upgrade cycles, you've got 400-gig in your PAM for optical business. As you just mentioned, you are ramping new data center interconnect business on 400ZR, 5G wireless, as you mentioned, and continued strong demand for your nearline HDD and enterprise SSD controllers. This would suggest a high-level sequential growth into Q4.
Does the team have the supply commitments, both wafers and packaging substrates, to drive quarter-on-quarter growth in Q4 if the backlog supports it?
Matt Murphy -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Thanks for the question, Harlan. We do, we see an increase in supply,you know, each quarter. Our backlog today and firm purchase orders firmly support that plus the supply that comes with it.
So, we do expect sequential growth in Q4. And as you mentioned, you outlined a number of growth opportunities. This isn't just going to be a Q3, Q4 type of phenomenon. Each one of these really carries into our calendar '22, and in many cases, accelerates.
So, that's why I said earlier in one of the prior questions, you know, there's blocking and tackling in Q3 and Q4, but we've been really working for the last six months in detail, even longer, on how do we line up continued strong growth in calendar '22, '23, '24 because this is going to be, you know, multiyear. And many of these engagements, by the way, are also multi-generational. So, we tend to transition from one platform to another, and we're going to see that in our 5G business as an example. So, yeah, bottom line is we do have supply lined up, and we're going to keep working hard to make sure we can chunk away that delinquency. And we're very focused on customer set at this point.
I think that's the main driving force of what we do right now, Harlan, is just to make sure that we're not the long pole in the tent that we're meeting what our customers need, and that we're also planning our business together, and I'm quite pleased with how that cooperation is going. And I think we have a very, very clear outlook for what we need to go get done in the next few quarters and through next year.

Our next question will come from Srini Pajjuri with SMBC Nikko Securities. Please go ahead.
Srinivas Pajjuri -- SMBC Nikko Securities -- Analyst
Thank you. Matt, I have a question on the hyperscale business. Obviously, you have several product cycles in the 400-gig, 400ZR, and you also mentioned DPUs. What I'm trying to figure out is that many of your peers are also reporting very strong demand from hyperscale? So, I'm trying to understand to what extent your business is mostly structural versus also benefiting from some of the spending increase and the cyclical factors? So, as we go through the next few quarters, I guess, some of the cyclical factors slow down.
Just trying to figure out how we should think about your core business that goes into the hyperscale customers?
Matt Murphy -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. I think, Srini, it's both. So, clearly, you know, the peer companies are -- I mean, there's probably one notable exception. But in general, the peer companies are reporting very strong growth in hyperscale.
So, I think that is secular, and I think that's very much happening. You know, if you just look at our organic growth, and you can do the math because you know sort of where Inphi was a year ago, it's very, very strong. And in fact, as I look to Q3, it both grow from Inphi, but as you pointed out -- and it's not just DPUs from Marvell, it's also our networking products with our storage products. I mean, we sell a number of product lines, let's call it 10, maybe 10-plus product lines, just going into cloud alone.
Almost each one of those is up even sequentially in Q3. Almost all of them are up. And then if you look at year over year, the growth in our data center business actually -- and cloud business from Marvell stand-alone would actually be even growing faster than the Inphi business. So -- and that's all on the basis of new designs and new ramps contributing to that. So, I think we've got both, we've got, you know, strong secular demand happening in the hyperscale, but it's our own unique cycles. As you mentioned, the transition from NRZ to PAM, and 400-gig, and 200-gig intra-data center, the ramp now of 400ZR, the attach rate of DPUs, attaching more and more as a percentage to CPUs.
And then you've got our own product cycles, whether they're new design wins and DIY storage for flash. I mean, I could go through the whole list, but it's -- I think that's the exciting thing about our portfolio, that's very differentiated in the semiconductor industry relative to the hyperscale accounts. We have so many product lines, very unique and very differentiated both in the silicon, and the software, and firmware we provide. And you know, we're just at the early stages in some of these, quite frankly, in terms of the ramp cycle.
So, when you look at the guide, we're going to be, you know, obviously, our guide for data center is about two times the rate of growth for the whole company just from Q2 to Q3. And certainly, we have very strong expectations heading into next year on the data center.

Our next question will come from Ambrish Srivastava with BMO. Please go ahead.
Ambrish Srivastava -- BMO Capital Markets -- Analyst
Hi. Thank you very much, Matt and Jean. On gross margin, despite all the input costs, you have been able to keep it to the higher end of the long term. And Matt, you made a comment about next year kind of expecting additional input -- not additional -- ongoing input cost increase.
So, should we expect gross margin to kind of stay in the higher end of the range like you're guiding to, or is there an offset? And I do realize that there's a product mix impact as well. So, just please helps us understand how we should think about the overall gross margin.
Jean Hu -- Chief Financial Officer
Hey, Ambrish. This is Jean. Yes, firstly, we're very pleased with our strong Q2 gross margin performance. And I think a lot of the things we discussed in the past is the primary driver of our gross margin is really a product mix.
And what we have been doing with the customers, as Matt mentioned, is that we're working with the customers, really try to minimize the impact from all the input cost increase. But overall, if you think about the product portfolio we have in data center, as Matt just mentioned earlier and also enterprise in Q2, we see our enterprise business, networking business growing 27% sequentially. All those significant performances on the product portfolio on the revenue side actually are very favorable to our gross margin. Fundamentally, it's a reflection of our investment in the IP. So, I don't think that will change because we continue to innovate, we continue to invest to drive the portfolio and the topline revenue growth.
So, we're going to be in the range, and we'll continue to work with the customers to set priorities and to make sure we meet the customers' needs first. And then, definitely, we want to make sure our operating model continues to leverage to expand the operating profit going forward.
Ambrish Srivastava -- BMO Capital Markets -- Analyst
Got it, Jean. So, we should assume at the higher end of the long-term range then, right, given how the product mix is shifting more toward --
Jean Hu -- Chief Financial Officer
The range is the product mix because we have five end markets. Quarter over quarter, you're going to see the variability of the mix change. Frankly, you know, what we discussed, the 64% to 65%, that range is potentially you are going to see in the long term.

Our next question will come from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Joseph Moore -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst
Great. Thank you. We appreciate the additional revenue classifications and the color there. I'm curious how you're thinking about building the development team? Are you going to focus on these end markets more? I noticed there are storage controllers, I think, going into four of the five segments, so are you going to maintain vertical market focus on storage, and then have kind of a go-to-market? And just how should we think about this impact not just where we see your business but how you're seeing internally?
Matt Murphy -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Thanks for the question, Joe. Actually, it's pretty insightful. So, we -- we're a product company, we're a technology company, we're organized by business units, we have divisions, business units, and product lines, and each of those is really responsible for driving technical excellence in everything we do, product differentiation roadmap.
And that's going to continue. What I would say though is, when I look at my level and when we look at what I -- and this has been consistent for five years, you know, I had a philosophy when I became CEO, which was that the semiconductor companies that adopted a market-based approach relative to looking at the R&D investment profile across its portfolio those companies that made that shift, we're going to have the biggest level going forward. I mean, I'm just -- I appreciate it internally all the time, which is the market always wins. And so, we had an era -- when I started in the industry, which was -- you just did parts as many parts as you can, put them out in the data book, so you buy the parts, best part wins. There was a shift to, hey, go focus on customers, find a customer, sell a basket of products. But in the end, it's really the end market orientation and concentration, which ultimately drives your business, and those -- that the -- shifting that mix is like one of the hardest things to do in business, OK. You can sort of shift your product line, you can move some investment around, but to get it to flow through to the P&L is really tough. And so, I think one of the things -- when you just take a 30,000-foot view, Joe, of what we've accomplished in the last five years, you know, consumer, when I joined was probably 70% to 80% of the revenue, right, it's 15.
I think the total contribution from cloud and 5G and auto was if it was $75 million bucks a year, we'd be lucky, OK. It's like doing -- you know, it's in the billions range today. So, that's really -- where I've been taking the firm over the last five years through the M&A, through all the investments, through the R&D changes we've made so that we can achieve an end-market mix that really meets our long-term strategy. And we're not there yet.
You know, I think, we're pleased we've sort of unveiled this thing. We're 40% in data center, we're 20% in carrier, we're 20% in enterprise, we've got this automotive thing that's growing really fast. So, that concentration now and where we want to be is very high, but the key focus areas like cloud, 5G, and auto, those are going to continue to increase as a percentage of our total. So, maybe a longer answer, Joe, we organized by business unit, but we run the company and ultimately the capital allocation framework ultimately around the end market, and even where's the R&D going.
And it's a very rigorous process we have internally, and you can see the results over the last five years of what we've been able to accomplish with that framework.

Our next question will come from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Toshiya Hari -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst
Thanks for taking -- hello?
Matt Murphy -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, we're here.
Toshiya Hari -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst
Sorry. Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on the solid results. Matt, I realize it's still a relatively small portion of your business, but you talked about your automotive business exceeding a $100 million in annualized run rate in Q3.
I was hoping you could speak to the breadth of that business today in terms of product, technology, customer mix. And I guess more importantly, based on the design win pipeline you have in front of you today, how are you thinking about the growth rate going forward in that business? Thank you.
Matt Murphy -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Great. Thanks for the question. So, you know, the business today has been squarely focused in the -- in this pretty radical change that happened over the last few years with the internal networks of the car moving to Ethernet-based products and packet-based networking, and that's for a number of reasons.
The design wins we have today are extremely broad, and we've got something like 24 -- 20 to 24 car OEMs, not models, not individual products, but the actual OEMs themselves who are adopting Marvell Ethernet technology. In many cases, they've elected to go sole source with us in those engagements, primarily to ensure interoperability because as you add more and more ECUs and modules inside the car that you want to hook up via Ethernet, you actually want to make sure that the link is highly reliable. We have wins both with the established leading Tier 1, you know, call it Top 10 car OEMs, but also a very strong position in the emerging challengers. You know, all the EV start-ups, which when you add it all up, and of course, Tesla is a big part of the number, but there's like $700 billion, $800 billion worth of market cap tied up and new emerging EV entrance. So, we've got sort of the new guys that are designing our stuff in, and that's a call option on growth.
And then we have the established players as well. Relative to the financial -- you know, the potential, we've said that we believe it's going to be about a $1 billion market over the next few years. And at our Analyst Day, you know, we gave line of sight to this being a multihundred-million-dollar type of business. That -- the business has accelerated. We had signaled last year that we were hoping to get to $25 million a quarter exiting the year.
We guided now that we're going get there in Q3, and this business has got tremendous momentum, and you can look at the data we provided now to see how far that business has come over the last seven, eight quarters. Most of that growth that you see has been driven by the automotive contribution. So, it's a big opportunity, and I think that ultimately -- that $1 billion market, you go out 10 years, it'll be probably $2 billion, and we obviously hope we can get a big, big share of that. So, it's a big opportunity. And I think the last point I would make is that it's really an entry now because it's such a key part of the car architecture that we're very, very focused now on applications outside of Ethernet.
So, compute applications, additional networking products, security, and storage, and we've really proven ourselves. Final point, we've shipped millions and millions of units now into cars that are on the road. We're running at -- an astonishing one DPPM type of quality rate, or actually less. In fact, the most recent update I got is we were in the 800, 900 PPB, which I can tell you having a lot of experience in the automotive market, it's really hard to get under one.
And the products have been engineered extremely well. We put it in place like a world-class automotive flow. So, we can leverage that, Toshi, for many other Marvell technologies and products outside of Ethernet. And you should expect to hear more from us on this in the future.

Our next question will come from Gary Mobley with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.
Gary Mobley -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst
Hi, I have a couple of questions for Jean. Jean, I would assume that you're in sort of the sweet spot of the opex synergy realization from the Inphi acquisition. You're guiding for roughly 1 million sequential growth in non-GAAP opex for the third quarter. And so, just given all the different moving pieces in your investments and the synergies to be realized in Inphi, is it realistic to think that you could see fourth-quarter opex drop sequentially, and then eventually, tick back up in the first quarter per year usual -- you know, first-year increases? And then for the non-GAAP tax rate, if I'm not mistaken, your expectation is for it to increase going forward.
Should we think about that maybe 100-basis-point to 200-basis-point annual increases going forward? Thank you.
Jean Hu -- Chief Financial Officer
Maybe the easy one first. On the non-GAAP tax rate for next year, you'll probably can just model about 6% because we do have a lot of the tax deductions as part of our merger with Inphi. So, that's the assumption you can model. On the opex rate, our team did a great job to integrate the one ERP one quarter ahead of the time.
So, if you look at the synergy achievement we outlined last quarter, we basically achieved the one ERP one quarter earlier, so the opex came off in Q2, and then Q3 guidance. Frankly, as I said earlier, we do see the pattern of synergy achievement just exactly the same as we outlined last quarter. So, Q4, typically, there are variabilities of opex. I think, I will leave it to you to model it, but from our perspective, we are quite confident to achieve the Inphi synergy. At the same time, the seasonality of opex in Q1, you're absolutely right, typically Q1 because of the payroll tax, the opex will step up.
I just want to make sure, right, the team at Marvell is very thoughtful in managing opex, but at the same time increases the investment to drive the long-term revenue growth, especially given the tremendous opportunities we have ahead of us. We are going to make sure we invest, but at the same time, we always going to drive revenue growth significantly higher than the opex growth.

Our next question will come from Chris Caso with Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Chris Caso -- Raymond James -- Analyst
Yes. Thank you. Good evening. The question is just a clarification of what's included in the new segmentation, specifically for data center.
And I think your comments that half of -- more than half of that business was cloud-based. What's the other half? Is that more in the area of campus networking? If you can clarify that. And maybe you could talk to the relative growth rates of cloud versus the noncloud that you're expecting within the data center segment going forward?
Matt Murphy -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Sure, you --
Jean Hu -- Chief Financial Officer
Maybe I'll try to give -- I'll give you the definition then Matt can add. On the on-premise data center, that part of the data center is really -- frankly, it's our -- some of the HDD business, fiber channel business, and the networking business, it's on-premise data center. But more than half, it's actually cloud data center. Matt, you can add more.
Matt Murphy -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, sure. So, think of this as our traditional industry standard servers, host bus adapter cards, enterprise mix, things like that. So, that business, historically, has been pretty flat. And just to clarify the campus networking products, that's an enterprise networking, so that moves to the enterprise line.
So, we've gone through pretty carefully and just figured out which -- what our revenue concentration is, specifically in the enterprise on-prem side. So, that, we assume, it's going to be a flattish business. It's been a flattish business. It'll have its ups and downs here and there.
All the growth is going to come from cloud. And so, as we mentioned, it's over half of the revenue today. And even if you look to Q3, the acceleration and growth you see is coming from that portion, and we expect the cloud to be probably one of the biggest growth drivers of the whole company over the next few years. I mean, cloud alone is larger than carrier, larger than enterprise, larger than consumer, larger than anything else. Just on its own, if you had it, it is its own line item, and that should continue to see very outsized growth for the foreseeable future.

Hi there, Quinn, your line might be muted.
Quinn Bolton -- Needham & Company -- Analyst

Quinn Bolton -- Needham & Company -- Analyst
Sorry, can you hear me now?
Matt Murphy -- President and Chief Executive Officer

Quinn Bolton -- Needham & Company -- Analyst
OK. Sorry about that. Matt, I was just going to ask on the 400ZR ramp, how much of that business for Marvell will be optical modules, complete modules versus just selling DSPs to other module vendors? And the reason I ask is if you look at your market share sort of by DSP, what share do you think you may ultimately achieve in the ZR market if you're just counting DSPs?
Matt Murphy -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. I think you're asking some great questions. Let me give you maybe a higher-level view, and then we've got -- as we mentioned, our Analyst Day coming up in October, where you're going to be able to hear actually from, you know, the various executives running these groups, and they'll talk in a lot more detail about sort of the questions you're asking because that's fairly specific. But at the highest level, 400ZR is going to be a combination, OK, of both modules, as well as stand-alone DSPs.
We've -- the team has lined up with a number of partners, both for the ZR applications, ZR plus, there's an open version of that. And then there's also applications for this that are not DCI, right, that are actually in the carrier market. And so, there's a broad opportunity here, Quinn, besides just, ""Hey, we take the one hyperscaler we had, we are moving to 400ZR and then it's done."" It's not that at all. It's -- and the initial ramp we are seeing is based on modules and we're continuing to be committed to that. That's good business for us.
But the Inphi team, I think, had done a great job of lining up a broader ecosystem set of partners to drive DSP sales as well. So, we can -- we'll give more color on those dynamics, you know, when we get into the Investor Day and we start talking more about our products and our technologies.
Quinn Bolton -- Needham & Company -- Analyst

Semiconductor stocks have been the essential drivers for technology growth in the past decade, and arguably more so after the pandemic. Some of the top semiconductor stocks have easily beaten the stock market on the back of impressive growth in revenue and earnings. It’s no secret that semiconductor companies have rewarded investors handsomely just in the past year alone. 
Following the news of Analog Devices (NASDAQ: ADI) and Maxim Integrated Products (NASDAQ: MXIM) acquiring antitrust clearance from China’s State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR), semiconductor stocks have received another timely boost in the stock market this week. The deal, which had already been approved by boards of both the companies, will create a chip-making giant worth $68 billion, according to Analog Devices. 
With the chip shortage expected to continue, many semiconductor stocks are ripe for continued gains. Today, we also saw Samsung Group announce that it will invest $205 billion in the next three years to expand its footprint in the post-pandemic era. The company expects these investments to strengthen its global position in the sector. Thus, would investing in semiconductor stocks be one of the better choices in the stock market today? If you share the same sentiment, do you have this list of the top semiconductor stocks to invest in today? 
Top Semiconductor Stocks To Buy [Or Sell] This Week
Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ: AMD)
NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA)
Applied Materials, Inc (NASDAQ: AMAT)
Marvell Technology Inc (NASDAQ: MRVL)
Advanced Micro Devices
First, on the list, we will be looking at the global semiconductor giant, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). Some of the company’s notable products include the x86 microprocessors (CPUs), accelerated processing units, graphic processing units (GPU), and semi-custom System-on-Chip products and chipsets. Notably, AMD stock jumped by 4% in Monday’s trading session. 
As some of you may recall, AMD announced the acquisition of Xilinx (NASDAQ: XLNX) back in October 2020. Up to now, the company has received antitrust approvals from the European Commission and from the U.K. government. So, this acquisition is now in the hands of the Chinese regulators and investors are responding positively to the recent development. 
Financially, the company has also been firing on all cylinders. For its second quarter, the company posted revenue of $3.85 billion, almost doubling that of the previous year. This is largely driven by higher revenue in both the Computing and Graphics segment and Enterprise and Embedded and Semi-custom segments. Furthermore, its net income was $710 million, increasing by a staggering 452% year-over-year. With all these in mind, would you consider buying AMD stock?

Applied Materials is one of the leading names in terms of materials engineering solutions. In detail, the company specializes in providing the necessary equipment, services, and software for the semiconductor manufacturing industry. Well, it achieves this via its expertise in modifying materials at atomic levels and on industrial scales.

On Friday last week, Applied Materials announced its third-quarter financials. It posted record quarterly revenue of $6.20 billion, representing an increase of 41% year-over-year. Moreover, the company also posted record quarterly GAAP earnings per share of $1.87, up by 105% year-over-year. This record performance is fueled by the digital transformation of the economy that has a strong demand for semiconductors. After all, Applied Materials does have one of the broadest and most enabling portfolio of technologies to accelerate its customer’s roadmaps. 
It is noteworthy that the California-based company unveiled a new way to engineer the wiring of advanced logic chips that enables scaling to the 3nm node and beyond during its third quarter. The new solution called the Endura® Copper Barrier Seed IMS™ combines seven different process technologies in one system under high vacuum to improve chip performance and power consumption.

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.

2021-08-13 00:00:00+00:00,MRVL Crosses Above Average Analyst Target,MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/mrvl-crosses-above-average-analyst-target-2021-08-13,,,"In recent trading, shares of Marvell Technology Inc (Symbol: MRVL) have crossed above the average analyst 12-month target price of $59.80, changing hands for $59.86/share. When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher — if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.
There are 18 different analyst targets within the Zacks coverage universe contributing to that average for Marvell Technology Inc, but the average is just that — a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $42.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $74.00. The standard deviation is $10.228.
But the whole reason to look at the average MRVL price target in the first place is to tap into a ""wisdom of crowds"" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with MRVL crossing above that average target price of $59.80/share, investors in MRVL have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $59.80 just one stop on the way to an even higher target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table?

2021-08-12 00:00:00+00:00,Interesting MRVL Put And Call Options For October 1st,MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/interesting-mrvl-put-and-call-options-for-october-1st-2021-08-12,,,"Investors in Marvell Technology Inc (Symbol: MRVL) saw new options become available today, for the October 1st expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the MRVL options chain for the new October 1st contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $59.00 strike price has a current bid of $2.78. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $59.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $56.22 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of MRVL, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $59.30/share today.
Because the $59.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 100%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 4.71% return on the cash commitment, or 34.40% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Marvell Technology Inc, and highlighting in green where the $59.00 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $60.00 strike price has a current bid of $2.61. If an investor was to purchase shares of MRVL stock at the current price level of $59.30/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $60.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 5.58% if the stock gets called away at the October 1st expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if MRVL shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Marvell Technology Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing MRVL's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $60.00 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $60.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 4.40% boost of extra return to the investor, or 32.13% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.
Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $59.30) to be 43%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

While the best companies are hard to find, but they can generate massive returns over long periods. Just think about the savvy investors who held Marvell Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRVL) shares for the last five years, while they gained 431%. And this is just one example of the epic gains achieved by some long term investors. On top of that, the share price is up 37% in about a quarter.
Because Marvell Technology made a loss in the last twelve months, we think the market is probably more focussed on revenue and revenue growth, at least for now. Shareholders of unprofitable companies usually expect strong revenue growth. That's because it's hard to be confident a company will be sustainable if revenue growth is negligible, and it never makes a profit.
For the last half decade, Marvell Technology can boast revenue growth at a rate of 5.7% per year. That's not a very high growth rate considering the bottom line. Therefore, we're a little surprised to see the share price gain has been so strong, at 40% per year, compound, over the period. We don't think the growth over the period is that great, but it could be that faster growth appears to some to be on the horizon. It's not immediately obvious to us why the market has been so enthusiastic about the stock, but a more detailed look at revenue and profit trends might reveal why shareholders are optimistic.

NasdaqGS:MRVL Earnings and Revenue Growth August 9th 2021
Marvell Technology is well known by investors, and plenty of clever analysts have tried to predict the future profit levels. So it makes a lot of sense to check out what analysts think Marvell Technology will earn in the future (free analyst consensus estimates)
What About Dividends?
When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. As it happens, Marvell Technology's TSR for the last 5 years was 461%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.
A Different Perspective
It's good to see that Marvell Technology has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 69% in the last twelve months. That's including the dividend. Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 41% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times. Someone with an optimistic perspective could view the recent improvement in TSR as indicating that the business itself is getting better with time. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Even so, be aware that Marvell Technology is showing 3 warning signs in our investment analysis , you should know about...

In-line with my previous, bullish assessments of Nokia (NYSE:NOK), the company recently reported very strong second-quarter results. As a result, NOK stock is close to reaching its  highest levels in over five years.

I remain upbeat on Nokia’s new chips,  the company’s CEO, who was hired last August,  and its opportunities. I’m also impressed by other new products that it’s launched and by some of its achievements last quarter, as well as by its overall Q2 results
As a result of these points, as well as the valuation of NOK stock, which remains very reasonable,  I continue to recommend that relatively conservative growth and value investors buy the shares.
Nokia Reported Strong Q2 Results
Nokia reported Q2 earnings per share, excluding some items, of 0.09 EUR, which was in-line with analysts’ average estimate. In Q2 of 2020, Nokia generated just 0.02 EUR of EPS.

7 Coronavirus Stocks to Buy as the Delta Variant Rises
Last quarter, its net sales came in at 5.3 billion EUR, up 4% versus the same period a year earlier. Analysts’  average, estimate was 5.16 billion EUR.  Meanwhile, Nokia’s operating profit surged 61% year-over-year to 682 million EUR. Finally, it raised its 2021 net sales guidance to 21.7 billion EUR-22.7 billion EUR from 20.6 billion EUR -21.8 billion EUR previously.
Also importantly,  Nokia’s selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) expenses fell 1% YOY to 585 million EUR last quarter, while its return on invested capital jumped seven percentage points YOY to 18.4% from 11.4%.
New Chip, Cost Cutting Gave Nokia a Boost
In a previous article, I noted that Nokia was in the midst of changing the chips that power its 5G offerings ” from Field Programmable Gate Arrays or FPGAs, which are very expensive, large, and energy-intensive, to cheaper, much more efficient SoCs.” Nokia calls its new 5G chipset — which it developed in partnership with Broadcom (NASDAQ:BRCM), Marvell (NASDAQ:MRVL), and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) — ReefShark.
According to Nokia, ReefShark extensively utilizes AI, and Light Reading reported in March that ReefShark carries higher margins than the FPGAs that the company had previously used.
Encouragingly, during the company’s Q2 earnings conference call, its CEO, Pekka Lundmark, reported that it had successfully launched a number of new systems that utilize ReefShark, including “new AirScale Radio and Baseband product platforms,” which were launched in June, MIMO Active Antenna radios, and 8T8R radios. Lundmark added that, by the end of 2021, Nokia anticipates that it will have “largely” caught up with its 5G infrastructure rivals in all the areas in which it had been lagging.
In Q2, 54% of Nokia’s product shipped with ReefShark chips, and Lundmark said that the company remained on track to ship 70% of its 5G products with those chips by the end of 2021.
Additionally, the CEO reported that its current baseband products are ” up to 75% more power efficient” than its previous offerings, while it now has the lightest MIMO active antenna in the sector.
The decline in the company’s SG&A spending, which came despite the sizeable increase in its revenue, shows that Lundmark is continuing to tighten the belt at Nokia, in accordance with my previous predictions. And the strong growth in Nokia’s ROIC shows that the company’s financial health and overall performance have improved under Lundmark’s leadership.
Other Signs of Progress
At the end of May, Nokia disclosed that T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) Netherlands had selected it “to deliver automated network and security operations.” The deal could lead to Nokia being selected to work on T-Mobile’s projects in other countries.
In July, Nokia received its first 5G deal in China, obtaining a 10% share of a contract from China Mobile and 4% of the roughly $6 billion that was spread over three deals from the Chinese telecom giant. In China, Nokia is benefiting from the fact that Sweden, decided to block Chinese telecom company Huawei from making deals in the Scandinavian country. One of Nokia’s top rivals, Ericsson (NASDAQ:ERIC), is based in Sweden.
Further, Lundmark reported that the company had signed two automotive licensing deals , including one with Daimler (OTC:DDAIF), last quarter. He suggested that, as vehicles become more connected, Nokia is likely to obtain more such contracts.
Finally, Cowen analyst Paul Silverstein wrote that Nokia was benefiting from “improving execution” and predicted that the tech company’s financial results should rebound further going forward. The analyst praised Lundmark’s performance and increased his price target on NOK stock to $8 from $5.
The Bottom Line on NOK Stock
With Lundmark turning around Nokia, the company’s technology improving,  5G continuing to proliferate, the automotive market heating up, and China looking more friendly to Nokia, the company’s financial results are bound to meaningfully improve going forward.
Despite these positive catalysts the shares still have a forward price-earnings ratio of less than 20, making them a good buy for conservative, value-oriented investors.

Aug 3 (Reuters) - Marvell Technology Inc MRVL.O on Tuesday said it has agreed to acquire chip startup Innovium in a $1.1 billion all-stock deal aimed at bolstering Marvell's share of networking chips sold to large cloud-computing companies.
Marvell's rival, Broadcom Inc AVGO.O, currently dominates the market for chips that go into the switches that help move digital information around inside massive data centers owned by cloud players like Amazon Web Services AMZN.O, Microsoft Corp MSFT.O and others. Marvell took a step toward getting into that market last year with its $10 billion purchase of Inphi Corp, whose chips help connect the switches with fiber optic cables.
Innovium's chip, by contrast, sits at the heart of the switches and competes directly against Broadcom. In an interview with Reuters, Marvell Chief Executive Matt Murphy said the company's long-term plan is to integrate the Innovium and Inphi products to deepen its ties with cloud computing vendors, which are some of the largest spenders in the world on chips.
Microsoft, for example, had $24.2 billion in capital expenditures last year, much of it spent on data centers.
""If you just look at all the semiconductor end markets and where the biggest growth is going to come from over the next five to 10 years across the whole chip industry, it's just breathtaking if you look at the capital expenditure commitments these companies are making,"" Murphy said.
Privately held Innovium is expected to generate $150 million in revenue in its next fiscal year. Under the terms of the deal, Marvell will pay $1.1 billion in stock but take on $145 million in cash from Innovium's balance sheet, resulting in a net cost to Marvell of $955 million.
Marvell also said it expects revenue of $1.065 billion, plus or minus 1.5%, when it reports earnings on Aug. 26, in line with analyst estimates, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
