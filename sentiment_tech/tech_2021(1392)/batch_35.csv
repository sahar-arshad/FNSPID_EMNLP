*Stock Advisor returns as of February 24, 2021
Brian Withers: There's an MIT spin-off called Derq, D-E-R-Q, that's using NVIDIA products to make AI and traffic intersections in roads safer. They have been gathering data for three years on real-world insights from an intersection in Detroit that's had a lot of crashes. The company has used their hardware to run their system. This AI bot that they are creating will be incorporated into NVIDIA's Metropolis software ecosystem that will help create smart cities. Derq is helping NVIDIA and NVIDIA is helping Derq. They've successfully shown that they can predict cars running red lights. This is the cool part for me, they can warn driver assistance systems and driverless cars to the potential of the accident before it can happen. You imagine sitting in traffic light and all of a sudden, your dash lights up and tells you not to go because somebody's coming the other direction. That's the power of what NVIDIA's video platform that's taking the world in and then transferring the data and converting it to real-world information.
What to watch for NVIDIA? They have an analyst day coming up on April 12. The optionality for this company is just amazing. Like I said, the graphics cards capabilities is still their biggest unit, AI is still pretty small, but just the power of this Derq example shows how NVIDIA can play in this next big wave of AI and interpreting visual information into real-world information. What do you guys think about NVIDIA? You're muted.
Brian Stoffel: I was muted. I have a question about NVIDIA. Normally, I stay away from hardware makers. I don't own shares of NVIDIA and part of that is because I believe that there's potential to get leapfrogged and to be commoditized. Do you see that as a threat? It's obviously always there, but who do you see as the biggest threat to that, for investors looking to buy shares of NVIDIA?
Withers: I'm like you. I'm not a big hardware player, but what I would say of NVIDIA is competition has always been a threat for them. Intel could have done it, AMD could've done it, but nobody has innovated as fast as NVIDIA. Sometimes, they come out with a graphics chip that isn't as great, but then they figure it out and roll it out the next time. I would watch to make sure NVIDIA's innovation engine is still humming at a high speed and that would be the [way it's] keeping the competition at bay.
Brian Feroldi: Brian, if you look at Tesla, they're making investments into their own chip and they have said that they plan on offering their system to other automakers. If they leapfrog NVIDIA and their chip dominates, does that kill the NVIDIA thesis?
Withers: I don't know that anything can kill the NVIDIA thesis because they have multiple streams of revenue. They have a pretty anti-fragile business with multiple streams. But Tesla's not the only car out there that's going to need these systems.
Stoffel: Before Brian Feroldi takes the next one, I will just say, of all hardware makers, NVIDIA gets one of the highest anti-fragile scores.
Feroldi: For sure. Super high-quality company.

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.

2021-04-13 00:00:00+00:00,These 2 Tech Stocks Could Be Big Winners From Biden's Infrastructure Bill,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/these-2-tech-stocks-could-be-big-winners-from-bidens-infrastructure-bill-2021-04-13,,,"The big news out of Washington has been the Biden administration's new infrastructure bill, called ""The American Jobs Plan."" It proposes $2 trillion in spending over the next eight years -- to fix some of America's failing infrastructure, while also preparing the country for the future by stimulating the electric-vehicle and clean-energy markets. If passed, the bill will substantially increase demand in many different industries including construction, manufacturing, and utilities.
Two tech stocks that could benefit from this $2 trillion in spending are Autodesk (NASDAQ: ADSK) and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC). Here's why.
Image source: Getty Images.
1. Autodesk
Autodesk sells software to businesses and people who make things. Its products include Revit, which is used by architects and construction managers; Maya, a special-effects and animation software package for the film industry; and many others. It also has a burgeoning product line in construction that it calls the Autodesk Construction Cloud. These software tools, which range from design to organization to communication, are sold to general contractors and other construction companies to help increase efficiency both at and away from the job site.
Last year, even with prolonged industry shutdowns due to COVID-19, Autodesk grew its revenue 16% to $3.79 billion while simultaneously generating $1.35 billion in free cash flow. Within the $2 trillion infrastructure bill, there are provisions for $115 billion in spending on bridges and roads, $80 billion for railways, and $85 billion for improving public transit. If and when projects within these industries get started, workers will likely use Autodesk software like AutoCAD, Civil 3D, and Navisworks to design and manage them.
Autodesk recently acquired Innovyze, a software-as-a-service (SaaS) platform that helps utilities manage assets and optimize their operations. The infrastructure bill proposes over $200 billion in spending across piping, water systems, and the electric grid. Some of those dollars would likely flow to Innovyze.
Lastly, Autodesk acquired Spacemaker, a software tool powered by artificial intelligence (AI), which helps architects and real estate planners build safer, more efficient, and better-looking homes. Biden's bill is currently allocating over $300 billion to home and school construction. Once Spacemaker goes global (it's from Norway), there could be a lot of future spending coming its way.
2. Intel
Intel has been around for decades, dominating the tech industry in the 1980s and '90s. However, it has recently lost its dominance to Asian competitors, especially Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE: TSM). TSM helps Intel's competitors outsource high-quality chip manufacturing, which enables them to get their technology on par with Intel's without huge capital expenditures.
Recently, there have been some indications that the tide is turning back towards Intel. Intel's board of directors brought back Pat Gelsinger, who used to work at Intel before taking the CEO role at VMware, to be CEO at the start of 2021. As a part of this company transition, Gelsinger announced a plan to invest $20 billion into two chip factories in Arizona, and the start of a new business line called Intel Foundry Services. The foundry business is a direct competitor to TSM, and already has support from tech giants like Amazon and Microsoft. Of Biden's $2 trillion plan, $50 billion is currently allocated to semiconductor manufacturing. Given that Intel is one of the only scaled semiconductor manufacturers in the United States, it is likely a lot of those expenditures will go to help it build out its foundry capabilities.
An entire investment thesis shouldn't revolve around Biden's infrastructure bill: It isn't guaranteed to pass, and will not magically turn bad businesses into good ones. However, Intel and Autodesk are two quality businesses that would directly benefit from an infrastructure bill. And if this one passes, demand for their products should grow over the next few years and beyond.

The first few months of 2021 saw many tech stocks peaking at all-time highs in February. Despite taking a breather since then, things may be looking up for tech companies again. After all, continuous innovation in this sector provides investors with reasons to keep their eyes on top tech stocks. On Friday, there was news of a monkey with brain implants having the ability to play computer games. That was thanks to the technology of Neuralink, a brain implant company owned by Tesla’s (NASDAQ: TSLA) CEO Elon Musk. In detail, Neuralink is developing Bluetooth-enabled implantable chips that can communicate with computer receivers. The end goal is to enable people with paralysis to use a computer or phone with their brain activity alone. 
With chip shortages plaguing many industries, chip maker stocks such as Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE: TSM) announced that they will be investing huge amounts into their chipmaking capacity. Essentially, this could help prevent another shortage of chips in the future. In March, Intel announced that it will be investing $20 billion into chip-making facilities. Meanwhile, TSM also announced that the company will be investing $100 billion into advanced chips over the next three years to keep up with rising demand. This clearly shows that tech companies are still continuously expanding. It is safe to say that their confidence in the industry is with good reasons. So if tech stocks piqued your interest, here are four worth watching out for. 
Top Tech Stocks To Buy [Or Sell] Now
Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (NYSE: BABA)
Sony Corp (NYSE: SONY)
Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT)
Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA)
Alibaba Group Holding Ltd
First on this list is technology giant Alibaba. The Chinese e-commerce giant grabbed the headlines on Saturday but not for the best of reasons. The company was hit with the highest ever antitrust fine imposed in China. The country’s regulator announced that it had slapped a fine of $2.8 billion on the tech giant. China’s State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) said that Alibaba abused its market dominance by punishing merchants that sell their merchandise on other platforms. The company has been punishing merchants if they use any rival sites.

Normally, this would be a huge cause of concern. However, if we take a step back and look at the bigger picture, the penalty is not even 1% of Alibaba’s market cap. It’s worth pointing out that the long-term potential of the company remains largely intact. E-commerce has been growing well even before the pandemic. With the pandemic changing people’s lives and routines, realizing how accessible e-commerce is. This has accelerated the growth of the industry. Now that Alibaba is able to move beyond this issue, would you be buying BABA stock?

Sony Corp
Sony Corporation is a Japanese multinational conglomerate that engages in the development, production, and sale of various electronic equipment and devices. It is also involved in the development and distribution of many types of entertainment. On April 8, its subsidiary Sony Pictures Entertainment (SPE) announced a multi-year, exclusive first pay window licensing deal with Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) in the U.S. for theatrically released SPE feature films. The deal covers titles including Morbius, Uncharted, the sequel to Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, and future installments of Venom and Spider-Man.

Earlier in April, Sony confirmed the acquisition of Som Livre, owner of the biggest domestic-born record label in Brazil. Som Livre is home to many of Brazil’s most popular artists including Marillia Mendonca, Jorge & Mateus, and many more. This goes to show Sony is still actively expanding its territories despite being one of the market leaders in its industry.
Also, the company boasts decent financial figures over the nine months ended December 31, 2020. Its revenue increased by 4% to $61.8 billion and net income skyrocketed by an impressive 87% to $9.7 billion. Thus, it may not come as a surprise that SONY stock has risen by over 40% in the past 6 months. With all these in mind, would you consider buying SONY stock?

Microsoft Corporation
Next on the list would be tech giant Microsoft. Besides its operating systems and productivity software, the company also has a strong presence in cloud computing and video game consoles. CNBC recently reported that Microsoft is in advanced talks to acquire the speech-recognition company Nuance Communications (NASDAQ: NUAN). Microsoft first approached Nuance in December last year. And the deal could finally be materializing. Nuance would have an equity value of $16 billion. That would make it Microsoft’s second-largest acquisition after the $27 billion purchase of Linkedin in 2016. The acquisition of Nuance could expand Microsoft’s capabilities in invoice software.

MSFT stock has been performing well in the stock market, rising 17% year-to-date. This is noteworthy at a time when some tech stocks appear to be losing investors’ interest. Financially, Microsoft is performing relatively well amid the pandemic. Most of its divisions like cloud computing, gaming, and virtual reality have flourished in the past year.
Recently, the company also acquired the contract to build more custom HoloLens augmented reality headsets for the U.S. military. The contract for over 120,000 headsets could be worth up to $22 billion over the next 10 years. With such exciting developments, do you think MSFT stock can continue its momentum?

Nvidia Corporation
Finishing off the list is Nvidia, the world leader in graphics processing units (GPU). For those unfamiliar, the company designs GPUs for the gaming and professional markets. In addition, it also manufactures system-on-a-chip units for the mobile computing and automotive markets. As we are all aware, games and animations alike have improved tremendously over the years. This is largely due to the improvement in graphics which is directly linked to the continuous improvement of processing architecture and continuous R&D.

With the rise of cryptocurrency, Nvidia is also not missing out on the party. The company can satisfy the demands from crypto-miners with its new crypto-mining specific GPUs. In March, Hut 8, a cryptocurrency mining company focused on mining bitcoin purchased $30 million worth of Nvidia’s new crypto mining-specific GPUs. This is to help the company expand into mining other cryptocurrencies besides bitcoin. Given the widespread applications for Nvidia’s products, will you consider adding NVDA stock to your watchlist?

The S&P 500 continues to grind higher, hitting another new all-time high on the move. That said, let’s look at a few top stock trades as we start the new trading week.
Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 1: Nvidia (NVDA)

Click to Enlarge
Source: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider
Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has been consolidating for eight months now. Is it finally time to rally? It may be, as the company continues to pummel the headlines with positive news from its GTC conference.
Shares are bursting through $590 resistance and quickly approaching the highs near $615. From here, I want to see a breakout over this area, putting the 161.8% extension from the September range in play up near $660. Above that could technically open the door to $700-plus.
Because the stock is up big on Monday and in the last four days — as well as in seven of the last eight sessions — we have to be aware of the downside too. In this case, Nvidia needs to hold $590 in order to keep bulls’ confidence high.

And can we just take a minute to appreciate how darn well that 50-week moving average held as support? Remember to use different timeframes when evaluating a stock (daily, weekly, monthly, etc.).
Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 2: Intel (INTC)

Ironically, the positive comments from Nvidia’s GTC conference that are giving the stock a boost are also the same comments that are hurting Intel (NASDAQ:INTC).
Intel was fresh off new 52-week highs, but are down more than 4% on the day. The stock is now sitting right at last week’s low.
If it loses this mark — at $64.70 — look for a possible test of the 10-week and 50-day moving averages. The 10-week has been strong support over the last few months as INTC has powered higher.
I would expect this zone to give the stock a bounce, provided it falls that far. If it fails to, $60 and the 21-week moving average may be in play.
Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 3: Uber (UBER)

Some good booking data from Uber (NYSE:UBER) has the stock looking to breakout — although bulls seem hesitant to bid it higher.
The stock is pushing through downtrend resistance (blue line), but struggling with resistance around $60. That zone has plagued the stock all year. If Uber can push through it, look for a test of the 52-week high up at $64.05. Above that opens the door to $70 and the two-times range extension.
On the downside, though, a move back below Monday’s low puts a gap-fill in play down toward $58.

Top Trades for Tomorrow No. 4: DraftKings (DKNG)

Click to Enlarge
Source: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider
What’s going on with DraftKings (NASDAQ:DKNG) now? The stock was a relative strength leader amid the growth-stock pullback, but now it’s struggling too.
Shares are pulling back into the key $56.75 area, as well as the 100-day and 21-week moving averages. While this area had a few “bend but didn’t break” moments (shown with purple arrows), it has ultimately held as support.
Having the extra moving averages there only helps bulls make their case. If it breaks, the $53 to $55 area could come into play quickly (even just for intraday action), but presently, the setup has a favorable risk/reward setup for buyers.
The one caution I would have is the head-and-shoulders look. I’m not a big head-and-shoulders pattern trader, and I don’t really care for the setup because I don’t find it that accurate (or maybe I’m just not good at it).
Either way, shares are at the “neckline” here, with the head and shoulders highlighted in blue. Keep an eye on it.
On the date of publication, Bret Kenwell held a long position in NVDA and DKNG.

2021-04-12 00:00:00+00:00,Why NVIDIA Stock Climbed While Intel and AMD Dipped Today,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-nvidia-stock-climbed-while-intel-and-amd-dipped-today-2021-04-12,,,"What happened
Shares of NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) climbed today while shares of rivals Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) and AMD (NASDAQ: AMD) dipped after NVIDIA unveiled a new CPU that will put competitive pressure on the latter companies in the important market for data center processors. As of 3:15 p.m. EDT, here's where all three semiconductor stocks were trading:
NVIDIA: Up 6%.
Intel: Down 5%.
AMD: Down 5%.
So what
NVIDIA kicked off its annual GPU Technology Conference (GTC) today with a slew of announcements, but the unveiling of a new CPU easily stole the show as the most meaningful new product. The company has long specialized primarily in GPUs instead of CPUs, and NVIDIA's prior efforts to develop CPUs have been lackluster. NVIDIA used to make Tegra processors for mobile devices, and it discontinued the Project Denver CPU core several years ago.
Image source: NVIDIA.
The company has now detailed a new chip called the NVIDIA Grace CPU, which is designed specifically to cater to the needs of the data center market. NVIDIA's GPUs have already been making inroads in data centers, powering cloud-based artificial intelligence (AI) workloads and other high-performance computing (HPC) applications. NVIDIA says Grace will deliver massive 10-time performance gains on servers for complex AI and HPC tasks.
The Grace chip, named after renowned computer scientist Grace Hopper, is built using Arm's high-efficiency architecture to enable that performance while using relatively less energy. NVIDIA is currently in the process of trying to acquire Arm, the British chip company that designs the architecture that nearly all mobile devices use, from Softbank for $40 billion in a deal that could reshape the chip industry.
""Leading-edge AI and data science are pushing today's computer architecture beyond its limits – processing unthinkable amounts of data,"" NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang said in a statement. ""Using licensed Arm IP, NVIDIA has designed Grace as a CPU specifically for giant-scale AI and HPC.""
The data center market has become increasingly important to NVIDIA's fortunes, with that business generating $6.7 billion in revenue last fiscal year. The segment is NVIDIA's fastest-growing business, with sales jumping 124% in fiscal 2021 while the core gaming business grew by a relatively more modest 41% to $7.76 billion.
Now what
Grace represents a significant competitive threat to Intel and AMD. Intel has long dominated the market for data center processors, and its Data Center Group (DCG) is among its most profitable businesses, generating $10.6 billion in operating profits in 2020. But DCG revenue declined 16% in the fourth quarter as rivals like AMD have been chipping away at Intel's market share.
The volume of data that needs to be processed in the age of AI and HPC is massive and growing exponentially, and NVIDIA believes it has the best chip for the job.

2021-04-12 00:00:00+00:00,See Which Of The Latest 13F Filers Holds Intel,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/see-which-of-the-latest-13f-filers-holds-intel-2021-04-12,,,"At Holdings Channel, we have reviewed the latest batch of the 25 most recent 13F filings for the 03/31/2021 reporting period, and noticed that Intel Corp (Symbol: INTC) was held by 19 of these funds. When hedge fund managers appear to be thinking alike, we find it is a good idea to take a closer look.
Before we proceed, it is important to point out that 13F filings do not tell the whole story, because these funds are only required to disclose their long positions with the SEC, but are not required to disclose their short positions. A fund making a bearish bet against a stock by shorting calls, for example, might also be long some amount of stock as they trade around their overall bearish position. This long component could show up in a 13F filing and everyone might assume the fund is bullish, but this tells only part of the story because the bearish/short side of the position is not seen.
Having given that caveat, we believe that looking at groups of 13F filings can be revealing, especially when comparing one holding period to another. Below, let's take a look at the change in INTC positions, for this latest batch of 13F filers:
FUND NEW POSITION? CHANGE IN SHARE COUNT CHANGE IN MARKET VALUE ($ IN 1000'S)
Wedge Capital Management L L P NC Existing +998,556 +$64,035
Investment Counsel Inc. Existing -3,450 +$829

Highland Private Wealth Management Existing +370 +$258

Livingston Group Asset Management CO operating as Southport Capital Management Existing -24,587 -$897
Aggregate Change: +1,270,710 +$94,561
In terms of shares owned, we count 13 of the above funds having increased existing INTC positions from 12/31/2020 to 03/31/2021, with 3 having decreased their positions and 2 new positions. Worth noting is that Hohimer Wealth Management LLC, included in this recent batch of 13F filers, exited INTC common stock as of 03/31/2021.
Looking beyond these particular funds in this one batch of most recent filers, we tallied up the INTC share count in the aggregate among all of the funds which held INTC at the 03/31/2021 reporting period (out of the 159 we looked at in total). We then compared that number to the sum total of INTC shares those same funds held back at the 12/31/2020 period, to see how the aggregate share count held by hedge funds has moved for INTC. We found that between these two periods, funds reduced their holdings by 317,847 shares in the aggregate, from 8,326,377 down to 8,008,530 for a share count decline of approximately -3.82%. The overall top three funds holding INTC on 03/31/2021 were:

2021-04-12 00:00:00+00:00,Nvidia announces Arm-based 'Grace' server chip in direct challenge to Intel,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/nvidia-announces-arm-based-grace-server-chip-in-direct-challenge-to-intel-2021-04-12,,,"By making its own central processor, Nvidia is taking on Intel and AMD directly for the first time. In a keynote speech announcing the chip, Nvidia Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang called the new server chip the ""final piece of the puzzle"" that will join Nvidia's graphics and networking chips to form the ""basic building block of the modern data center.”
Santa Clara, California-based Nvidia said the ""Grace"" server processor, which will be released in 2023, is designed to handle tasks like training artificial intelligence algorithms. Once known for its graphics chips to improve the play of video games, Nvidia has focused heavily on artificial intelligence computing in recent years, helping its market capitalization exceed Intel's to become the largest U.S. semiconductor firm.
Nvidia also said that the Swiss National Supercomputing Centre will make a new supercomputer dubbed ""Alps"" using the new ""Grace"" processors and built by Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co HPE.N. The computing system, which Huang said will be 10 times faster than the world's current best supercomputer, will be used for tasks such as weather forecasting and physics research.
Nvidia officials said that the company's accelerator chips will continue to support central processors from Intel and AMD even as it dives into the market itself. Huang said that Nvidia will alternate its focus, concentrating on making accelerator chips that work with Arm-processors one year, and then chips that work with AMD and Intel chips in the next year.
Nvidia did not disclose which Arm technology it would use for the chips but said they would use computing cores Arm's ""Neoverse"" family of server chip technology that will be released in the future. Huang said it was ""off-the-shelf"" technology from Arm.
Nvidia said in September that it will buy Arm for $40 billion.
Nvidia's rivals have expressed concerns that the company will use its potential ownership of Arm to get early access to Arm's technologies as they become more prevalent in the data center market.
Arm said that Nvidia has had the same access to its intellectual property as the rest of Arm's customer base and did not get early access to its technology.

WASHINGTON, April 12 (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden will urge Congress to invest $50 billion in semiconductor manufacturing and research when he meets with top executives from nearly 20 major companies on Monday about the global chips shortage that has roiled the automotive industry and technology firms.
The push is part of his broader focus on rebuilding U.S. manufacturing as a powerhouse for the world's largest economy - and a source of good-paying jobs - after years of declining investments and productivity growth, a senior administration official said.
The White House meeting is billed as the ""CEO Summit on Semiconductor and Supply Chain Resilience"" and will include White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan and National Economic Council Director Brian Deese.
Biden is expected to stop by the meeting to push his $2 trillion infrastructure plan, which includes $300 billion aimed at expanding manufacturing, especially in disadvantaged areas and communities of color through loans, grants, investments and the targeted use of federal procurements.
While the proposed investments will take time to implement, the administration is also seeking ""short-term and medium-term solutions that will be discussed during the summit,"" the official said. No further details were immediately available.
As of midday Friday, 19 major companies had agreed to send executives, including General Motors GM.N Chief Executive Mary Barra, Ford Motor F.N Chief Executive Jim Farley and Chrysler-parent Stellantis NV STLA.MI CEO Carlos Tavares.
The ""summit reflects the urgent need to strengthen critical supply chains,"" Deese said in a statement.
Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo will also take part, as well as executives from GlobalFoundries, PACCAR Inc PCAR.O, NXP and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co 2330.TW, AT&T T.N, Samsung 005930.KS, Google-parent Alphabet GOOGL.O, Dell Technologies DELL.N, Intel Corp INTC.O, Medtronic MDT.N, Northrop Grumman NOC.N, Hewlett Packard Enterprises HPE.N, Cummins CMI.N and Micron Technology MU.O.
A U.S. auto industry group this week urged the government to help and warned that a global semiconductor shortage could result in 1.28 million fewer vehicles built this year and disrupt production for another six months.
Over the weekend, GM canceled more truck production shifts at two U.S. plants.
""Trying to address supply chains on a crisis-by-crisis basis creates critical national security vulnerabilities,"" Sullivan said in a statement.
Automakers have been hit particularly hard by the global chip shortage after many canceled orders when auto plants were idled during the coronavirus pandemic.
When they were ready to resume production, they found chipmakers were busy fulfilling orders for the consumer electronics industry, which has seen demand for premium devices - both for work and leisure - boom as people spent more time at home.
Broadband internet, cellphone and cable TV companies also face delays in receiving ""network switches, routers, and servers,"" according to an industry group.
""Shortages in semiconductors and the associated delays will result in hundreds of millions of dollars in impact to the broadband and cable television industry this year,"" the group said last week.
Biden wants at least $100 billion to boost U.S. semiconductor production and fund investments to support production of critical goods, but officials said this funding will not address short-term chip needs.
Later this week, the Senate Commerce Committee will hold its first hearing on a bipartisan measure to bolster technology research and development efforts in a bid to address Chinese competition.

2021-04-12 00:00:00+00:00,Intel's Mobileye teams with startup Udelv on automated delivery,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intels-mobileye-teams-with-startup-udelv-on-automated-delivery-2021-04-12,,,"By Paul Lienert
April 12 (Reuters) - Intel Corp’s INTC.O Mobileye has teamed with four-year-old Silicon Valley startup Udelv in an effort to put automated electric delivery vehicles into service in the United States by 2023, the companies said on Monday.
Mobileye is supplying a fully automated driving system for Udelv’s new Transporter, a boxy electric shuttle without seats or cockpit that is designed specifically for delivery.
Udelv will not sell the vehicles, but will offer them as part of a subscription-based delivery-as-a-service package to commercial customers. And while the vehicles will not have human drivers, Udelv plans to offer a teleoperation feature with humans remotely assisting customers with vehicle loading and unloading.
Udelv is among at least half-a-dozen self-driving technology companies that are focusing on delivery of goods rather than robotaxis. The shift was triggered by the pandemic-driven boom in e-commerce and touchless delivery, as well as the belief that automated movement of goods faces fewer regulatory and legal hurdles than the transport of people.
Among the likely competitors is General Motors Co GM.N, which earlier this year announced its BrightDrop electric commercial delivery vehicles and service. While Brightdrop does not include automated driving for now, GM's majority-owned Cruise subsidiary continues to test self-driving shuttles for both goods delivery and human transport.
Alphabet Inc’s GOOGL.O Waymo is also testing automated deliveries in a variety of commercial vehicles from several partners, while Amazon.com Inc's AMZN.O Zoox subsidiary has designed a self-driving shuttle for both people and cargo transport. Neither company has laid out a specific timetable for commercial deployment.
Startups focused on automated delivery vehicles and services include Nuro, Gatik and Boxbot, all based in Northern California.
Udelv said it planned to build and deploy at least 35,000 of its new Transporters between 2023 and 2028, but would not say where those vehicles will be built or who will build them.
Until the new vehicle is ready for prototype testing in 2022 and commercial deployment in 2023, Udelv will continue to use converted Ford Transit Connect vans equipped with Udelv’s self-developed automation system, which Udelv's chief executive and co-founder, Daniel Laury, said is based on Baidu's 9888.HK Apollo self-driving software.
Laury said Udelv was switching from its own system because Mobileye offered ""the best-in-class solution"" with duplicate hardware stacks for extra safety in case one fails.
Mobileye said the company’s new Drive automated system is based on the new EyeQ5 system-on-a-chip and will be ready for testing in early 2022.

2021-04-12 00:00:00+00:00,"Intel, Cisco: Why Value Tech Stocks Hit The Sweet Spot In The Current Market",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intel-cisco%3A-why-value-tech-stocks-hit-the-sweet-spot-in-the-current-market-2021-04-12,,,"Our theme of Value Tech Stocks has outperformed this year, rising by about 13% year-to-date, compared to the Nasdaq-100 which is up by just about 6% over the same period. The theme includes stocks from the tech sector that have a market cap of over $10 billion, trading at a trailing price to earnings multiple of under 20x. With the rate of Covid-19 vaccinations improving and the economy opening up, investors are pivoting away from Covid-19 winners, such as work from home and software as a service stocks, to more cyclical and value names. We think that value tech stocks hit the sweet spot in this market as they trade at reasonable valuations while playing on the broader theme of greater digitization and higher corporate IT spends. Within our theme, Intel stock (NASDAQ:INTC) has been the strongest performer, rising by about 33% year-to-date, driven by strong semiconductor demand, large new investment plans, and some changes at the top management level. Cisco stock (NASDAQ:CSCO) has also fared well, rising by about 16% year-to-date, as enterprises are likely to increase spending on network infrastructure post the pandemic, with overall corporate IT budgets also likely to trend higher. Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) has been the worst performer, with its stock declining by about -1% year-to-date.
[3/8/21] Will Rising Bond Yields Help Value Tech Stocks?
Our theme of Value Tech Stocks includes technology names with a market cap of over $10 billion that are trading at a trailing P/E of under 20x.  Although the theme has underperformed since 2017, rising by just about 31%, compared to the Nasdaq-100, which has more than doubled over the period, it has fared better this year, rising 1.5% year-to-date compared to the Nasdaq-100 which is down by over 4%. There’s a good chance these stocks could continue to outperform in 2021, as rising bond yields take some sheen off higher growth names with investors potentially rotating into value stocks. For perspective, the 10-year Treasury yield has risen from around 1.1% to 1.6% in just about a month. Now, value tech stocks might hit the sweet spot in this market as they trade at reasonable valuations while playing on the broader Covid-19 theme of greater digitization and higher corporate IT spends. Moreover, most of the names in our theme are mature tech companies that are incumbents in their respective segments. Within our theme, Intel stock (NASDAQ:INTC) has been the strongest performer, rising by about 20% year-to-date driven by strong semiconductor demand and some top management changes. On the other side, Marvell (NASDAQ: MRVL) a company that develops and produces semiconductors and related technology has underperformed on account of mixed quarterly earnings, with its stock declining by about 13% year-to-date.
[2/22/2021] Will Tech’s Old Guard Beat The Market In 2021?
Our theme of Value Tech Stocks has underperformed the market in recent years, rising by just about 29% since the end of 2017, compared to the S&P 500 which is up by about 46% over the same period. The theme includes tech companies that offer essential technology products and services, have a market capitalization of over $10 billion, and trade at a trailing price to earnings multiple of under 20x. In comparison, the broader NASDAQ index trades at a much higher 40x trailing P/E. However, we believe that the stocks in our theme have lower price risk in the current market environment, and at the same time could offer reasonable upside from increasing digitization and higher corporate IT spends following Covid-19. Below is a bit more about the stocks in the theme and some trends that could help to drive them higher in the near-term.
Intel stock (NASDAQ:INTC) stock has been the best performer within our theme this year so far, rising by about 26% since early January, driven by stronger than expected Q4 results and guidance for the current quarter, and also due to the appointment of new CEO Pat Gelsinger. Moreover, demand for semiconductors has been strong across the board, with many end-markets facing chip shortages. Intel, with its sizable production capacity, should stand to gain.
Cisco stock (NASDAQ:CSCO)  is up by about 2% year-to-date. The company has been witnessing weaker demand for its networking gear as the Covid-19 pandemic caused customers to postpone deployments and also due to stronger competition. However, IT spending is expected to rebound sharply as the pandemic wanes and Cisco should be well poised to benefit. Additionally, Cisco’s pivot to a more software-centric model should also help the stock.
Oracle stock (NYSE:ORCL) stock is down by about -5.5% year-to-date. Although revenues have faced pressure in recent years as the hardware and services segments have taken a hit, the company’s cloud operations, particularly its public cloud business, could unlock a lot of value. During its most recent quarter, the company said that revenue from its Gen 2 cloud was up over 100% year-over-year. As the public cloud business continues to gain scale and the company provides more transparency, investors could potentially re-rate the stock higher.
[Updated 1/20/2021] Value Tech Stocks 
Our indicative theme of Value Tech Stocks includes relatively mature businesses that offer essential technology products and services and trade at reasonable valuations. Specifically, we have picked tech companies that are trading at a trailing price to earnings multiple of under 20x and have a market capitalization of over $10 billion. Although these stocks haven’t really rallied since our last update in November, with the Covid-19 vaccines roll out gathering steam globally, it’s likely only a matter of time before broader economic growth returns, helping value stocks, including reasonably priced technology names. Here’s a quick rundown of some value stocks in our Value tech stocks theme.
Intel (INTC) has been out of favor with investors due to increasing preference for lower-cost ARM-based chipsets and a delay in its rollout of its next-generation 7nm CPUs. However, the stock is up by about 16% year-to-date, as investors have a favorable view of Intel’s recently announced top management shakeup, which will see VMware CEO and former Intel CTO Pat Gelsinger succeed current Intel CEO, Bob Swan.
Cisco (CSCO) stock has also been listless as corporations paired back on spending on networking gear through the Covid-19 recession. However, IT spending is likely to rebound sharply over 2021 and Cisco being the go-to company for enterprise networking solutions should benefit. The company’s gradual pivoting to a more software-driven model should also help the stock. The stock is up by about 1.5% this year.
Oracle (ORCL) is a provider of database, cloud, and enterprise software products. The stock has seen steady growth over the last several years, driven by expanding earnings and its share repurchase program. The company has been expanding sales of its cloud-based applications, such as Fusion and enterprise resourcing planning services, helping to offset the slow growth of its legacy offerings. The stock is down by about -4.5% this year.
NetApp (NTAP) is a company that sells hardware and software focused on data management. While the company has seen a mixed performance in recent quarters, due to weak demand from large customers and its significant reliance on hardware sales, its increasing focus on the cloud computing market should help the stock. The stock is down 2.5% year to date.
[ Updated 11/24/2020] Is it A Good Time To Double Down On Value Tech Stocks?
Value Tech Stocks such as Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) have had a mixed year. There was good reason for this, as the deep Covid-19 recession, abundant liquidity following interest rate cuts, and the growing at-home economy drove investors to hyper-growth software as service stocks, high-risk, high reward sectors such as electric vehicles, and fast-growing platform players such as Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).
However, with the availability of multiple highly effective Covid-19 vaccines (Pfizer, Moderna, and AstraZeneca have published strong efficacy data on their vaccines) looking likely in 2021, things are likely to gradually start returning to normal. Moreover, the Fed could also eventually revisit its stance on ultra-low interest rates as the economy shows signs of picking up.  As this plays out investors could re-visit lower growth stocks that represent compelling value. While positive news about the vaccine earlier this month has already buoyed cyclical sectors such as energy, industrials, and financials we think it’s likely that funds will flow to value tech stocks in the near-to-medium term.
Our indicative theme of Value Tech Stocks includes relatively mature businesses that offer essential technology products and services and trade at reasonable valuations. Specifically, we have picked companies that are trading at a trailing price to earnings multiple of under 18x and have a market capitalization of over $10 billion. Key names in the theme include Oracle (ORCL) , VMware Inc (VMW), Seagate Technology (STX), Cisco (CSCO), and Intel (INTC).
[Updated 11/10/2020] Can Intel Stock Recover?
Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) stock has had a rough year, driven by delays in the company’s transition to the next generation 7-nano meter technology for its chips, some recent headwinds at its cloud and data center business, and strong competition from rival AMD in the PC and server CPU space. The stock is down by about 25% this year, significantly underperforming the NASDAQ which is up by over 28%. That said, there have been some positive developments that could help the company get back on track. In October, Intel announced a deal to sell its NAND business to SK Hynix for about $9 billion in a move that could allow the company to focus on its core CPU business, while bolstering its liquidity. Intel also appears to be more flexible with its manufacturing, recently noting that it could produce its next-gen chips in-house, or outsource them, or even use a hybrid model that leverages both internal and external fabs. Intel stock looks like good value at the moment, trading at just about 9.5x projected 2020 earnings. While growth could remain tepid in the near-term, Intel’s scale, its vast marketing and distribution footprint, and its large base of corporate customers, who rely on Intel processors and are likely averse to switching, should help the company in the medium to long-term.
See our indicative theme on Value Tech Stocks for a complete list of technology companies – including Intel, NetApp, and Oracle – that look like good value at the moment. The theme has underperformed this year, remaining roughly flat year-to-date, versus the S&P 500 which is up by about 10%.
[Updated 9/3/2020] Value Tech Stocks
While high-growth information technology stocks have rallied sharply this year, with valuations looking increasingly stretched, we’ve picked a few stocks including Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), and NetApp (NASDAQ:NTAP) that have relatively stable and mature businesses and still offer good value. Specifically, we have picked companies that are trading at a trailing price to earnings multiple of under 18x and have a market capitalization of over $10 billion. See our analysis Value Tech Stocks for more details on the returns and performance of these stocks. Parts of the analysis are summarized below.
Intel ($215 billion market cap, -15% YTD), the largest CPU vendor has been somewhat out of favor with investors on account of increasing competition from lower-cost ARM-based chipsets and the company’s delay in its rollout of its next-generation 7nm CPUs. However, Intel looks like good value considering its large base of existing customers, who rely on Intel processors and are likely averse to switch and also due to its vast marketing and distribution footprint. The stock trades at about 11x 2019 earnings.
Cisco ($178 billion market cap, -10% YTD), one of the largest network equipment providers, has also underperformed the market as it has struggled with top-line and bottom-line growth. However, the increasing digitization caused by the Covid-19 pandemic could drive demand for connectivity, in turn improving sales of Cisco’s networking software, and products such as switches and routers. The stock trades at about 16x FY’19 earnings.
NetApp ($10 billion market cap, -25% YTD) is a company that sells hardware and software focused on data management. While the company has seen a mixed performance this year due to weak demand from large customers and its significant reliance on hardware sales, it is looking to double down on the cloud computing market. Last month, NetApp closed a deal to acquire Spot, a leader in compute management, and cost optimization for public clouds. The stock currently trades at about 13x last fiscal year earnings.
While value tech stocks look attractive, 2020 has also created many pricing discontinuities which can offer attractive trading opportunities. For example, you’ll be surprised how the stock valuation for Apple vs. Logitech shows a disconnect with their relative operational growth. You can find many such discontinuous pairs here.

WASHINGTON, April 9 (Reuters) - Almost 20 major companies worried about a global semiconductor chip shortage that has roiled the automotive industry will send senior executives to a White House summit Monday, a senior official said on Friday.
Reuters reported earlier the summit is expected to include General Motors GM.N Chief Executive Mary Barra and Ford Motor F.N Chief Executive Jim Farley.
The White House official confirmed the three largest U.S. automakers, including Chrysler-parent Stellantis NV STLA.MI will attend, as will executives from GlobalFoundries, PACCAR PCAR.O, NXP NOC.N and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company 2330.TW.
The White House meeting is billed as the ""CEO Summit on Semiconductor and Supply Chain Resilience"" and will include White House National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan and National Economic Council Director Brian Deese. As of midday Friday, 19 major companies had agreed to send executives.
Deese said in a statement the ""summit reflects the urgent need to strengthen critical supply chains.""
Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo will also take part.
A U.S. auto industry group this week urged the U.S. government to help and warned that a global semiconductor shortage could result in 1.28 million fewer vehicles built this year and disrupt production for another six months.
Also taking part are AT&T T.N, Samsung 005930.KS, Google-parent Alphabet GOOGL.O, Dell Technologies DELL.N, Intel Corp INTC.O, Medtronic MDT.N, Northrop Grumman NOC.N, HP HPQ.N Cummins CMI.N and Micron MU.O.
""Trying to address supply chains on a crisis-by-crisis basis creates critical national security vulnerabilities,"" Sullivan said in a statement.
Broadband internet, cellphone and cable TV companies also face delays in receiving ""network switches, routers, and servers. ... Shortages in semiconductors and the associated delays will result in hundreds of millions of dollars in impact to the broadband and cable television industry this year,"" an industry group said this week.
President Joe Biden wants at least $100 billion toboost U.S. semiconductor production and fund investments to support production of critical goods, but officials said this funding will not address short-term chip needs.
On Thursday GM and Ford both announced new vehicle production cuts on Thursday.

The global semiconductor market could then grow at a compound annual growth rate of 10% between 2021 and 2026, according to research firm EMR. That stable demand suggests most investors should own at least a few chip stocks -- but the complex market can be daunting for newcomers.
So today I'll walk you through four of the world's most important chipmaking companies, and highlight why they could be great investments for the next decade.

1. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing
In the past, many chipmakers manufactured their chips with their own fabrication plants, also known as fabs or foundries. But it became increasingly expensive and difficult to manufacture smaller and more powerful chips, which are measured in nanometers, and many chipmakers eventually adopted a ""fabless"" model by outsourcing the manufacturing process to a third-party foundry.
Today, only three foundries -- Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM), Samsung, and Intel -- can manufacture the world's smallest chips. TSMC is the largest and most technologically advanced of the three, and fabless chipmakers like AMD, NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA), Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM), and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) all rely on its plants to produce their newest 5nm and 7nm chips.
TSMC's revenue and earnings rose 25% and 50%, respectively, last year as those orders flooded in. Analysts expect its revenue and earnings to grow 20% and 17%, respectively, this year, even as it boosts its capex by up to 63% to maintain its lead in the ""process race"" to create ever-smaller chips.
2. ASML Holding
TSMC might be the world's most important contract chipmaker, but it can't manufacture its chips without ASML Holding's (NASDAQ: ASML) lithography machines, which print circuit patterns onto wafers.

The Dutch company controls about 90% of this market, and its newest EUV (extreme ultraviolet) lithography systems are used to manufacture 5nm and 7nm chips. Its largest customer is TSMC, so it should directly benefit from the latter's rising capex over the next decade.
ASML will launch even more advanced EUV systems, called high-NA systems, over the next few years to manufacture 3nm and 2nm chips between 2022 and 2025. That roadmap directly aligns with TSMC's, and it will enable ASML to remain one of the industry's most important equipment makers for the foreseeable future.
ASML's revenue and earnings rose 18% and 38%, respectively, last year. Analysts expect its revenue and earnings to grow another 32% and 41%, respectively, this year as it profits from surging demand for new chips.
3. NVIDIA
NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) is the world's largest producer of discrete GPUs. GPUs are often associated with gaming, but they're also used to mine cryptocurrencies and process machine learning tasks in data centers.
But that's not all. NVIDIA also plans to buy Arm Holdings from Softbank, which provides the chip designs for most of the world's mobile chips. If the deal is approved, NVIDIA will receive royalties and licensing fees from every producer of Arm-based chips worldwide -- including Apple, Qualcomm, MediaTek, and Huawei.
NVIDIA's revenue and adjusted earnings rose 53% and 73%, respectively, last year as sales of its gaming and data center chips surged. Wall Street analysts expect NVIDIA's revenue and earnings to rise another 33% and 34%, respectively, this year as it continues to profit from those secular tailwinds.
Those estimates could also be too low if its proposed takeover of Arm, which still faces a lot of regulatory challenges, is approved ahead of schedule. Regardless of what happens, demand for NVIDIA's GPUs should continue rising as games become more graphically demanding and AI tasks grow more complex.
4. Qualcomm
Last but not least, Qualcomm is an evergreen chipmaker for two simple reasons. First, it's the world's largest mobile chipmaker by a wide margin. Its Snapdragon SoCs (system on chips) unite Arm-based CPUs, GPUs, and baseband modems into cost-effective bundles for smartphone makers.
Second, Qualcomm owns the world's largest portfolio of wireless patents, which entitles it a cut of every smartphone sold worldwide. Its dominance of both the mobile chip and licensing markets made it a popular target for antitrust regulators in the past, but it's resolved most of those issues and remains well-poised to profit from the growth of the 5G market.
Qualcomm's revenue and adjusted earnings grew 12% and 18%, respectively, last year. Those growth rates were stable, but analysts expect its revenue and earnings to surge 43% and 74%, respectively, this year as smartphone makers sell more 5G devices. It also expects the expansion of other markets, including auto telematics chips, to complement that growth.
The bottom line
The semiconductor market might seem confusing at first, but it becomes easier to understand once you break apart the pieces. TSML, ASML, NVIDIA, and Qualcomm are all solid starter stocks in this sector, and they should all continue to rise over the next decade amid soaring demand for more powerful chips.

2021-04-09 00:00:00+00:00,Better Buy: NXP Semiconductors vs. Intel,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/better-buy%3A-nxp-semiconductors-vs.-intel-2021-04-09,,,"The U.S.-China trade war, the coronavirus pandemic, and a sudden spike in demand for tech hardware have caused a shortage of semiconductors. That shortage is a real problem for many manufacturers this year. But for chip companies, there could be worse problems.
A shortage of tech's most basic building blocks means higher selling prices for what is available and plenty of outlets for new sales. Given the situation, chip fabrication stocks are a buy in my book for 2021. Two of the top plays in this space are NXP Semiconductors (NASDAQ: NXPI) and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), but one of them looks like a more timely purchase at the moment.
Boomtime for digital connectivity
NXP may not be the household name Intel is, but it is nonetheless a giant in the semiconductor industry. The company is valued at a market cap of $58 billion as of this writing and has hauled in $8.6 billion in sales over the last trailing 12-month stretch via its integrated chip design department and manufacturing facilities.
Image source: Getty Images.
NXP makes an array of hardware for smartphones and communications networks, industrial applications, and smart-home devices. But it's the auto industry that comprises some 40% of the company's sales. That wasn't a great place to be last year when auto sales plunged more than 15%. However, as NXP focuses on chips that enable connectivity, revenue is ramping up quickly. Many modern cars have an electric drivetrain, advanced driver assist system (ADAS) features making their way to self-driving functionality, and a range of connected options to help a driver pair their smartphone to stay in touch with others on the go.
This is turning into a boon for NXP. After a short drought last spring and summer, 2020 fourth-quarter revenue increased 9% year over year to $2.5 billion. And as it gets bigger, the company is reaching a more efficient scale. Adjusted operating income thus increased 11% in Q4 to $764 million. And with the global shortage of semiconductors acting as a tailwind, NXP is in a good spot right now. Sales are expected to increase 26% at the midpoint of guidance for the first quarter of 2021. Add in the fact the company will be lapping depressed financial results that started during the pandemic lockdown last spring, and NXP will likely be in strong growth mode throughout the upcoming year.
NXP also just boosted its quarterly dividend payout by 50%. Currently, shares yield an annualized 1.1%. Add in a new $2 billion share repurchase plan (in addition to the $625 million it had remaining on its previous plan), and this is a solid tech income stock. Shares trade for a premium 31 times trailing 12-month free cash flow, but it's not unreasonable given the strong growth NXP expects to generate.
Kong strikes a blow, but Chipzilla counters
Chipzilla (Intel) has been under duress. Numerous other companies are trying to supplant Intel's chip design leadership, and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) already surpassed Intel's manufacturing size and prowess years ago. In spite of imperfections, though, Intel is still the semiconductor firm to beat. Intel's revenue was $78 billion in 2020, an 8% increase over 2019 -- although sales did slide 1% during the final quarter of the year.
Some improvements need to be made, though, especially in its manufacturing operation. Sinking $20 billion into new fabrication facilities in Arizona will help, as will allocating some of the new capacity to making chips for those semiconductor firms that only design silicon and outsource manufacturing (the exclusive function that TSMC concerns itself with). Intel could get some help from the federal government, too. The Biden administration's $2 trillion infrastructure plan allocates funds to boosting America's chipmaking industry to create modern jobs for the 21st century.
But it could take time for Intel's investment to pay off. Case in point: Where other firms are predicting big year-over-year increases to kick off 2021, Intel is predicting a decline. Q1 revenue was forecast to be down 6% to $18.6 billion. The saving grace is that Intel will remain a highly profitable tech behemoth, anticipating an operating profit margin of 27% (compared to 35% in Q1 2020).
It's been rough going for Intel lately, but shares have rallied off of multi-year lows in anticipation of the company pulling off its counterstrike against the dozens of companies trying to take some of its market share. As of this writing, the stock trades for just 13 times trailing 12-month free cash flow, although that metric could deteriorate as the company spends to build new fabrication facilities. It also yields a 2.1% yearly dividend, not bad for a tech stock. If rebound stories are up your alley, Intel fits the bill.
Which is the better buy?
Intel could very well be a screaming value at these levels -- but only if it can regain some growth as the semiconductor industry becomes increasingly important in a new digital era. This story will take time to play out, and the company could lose more market share to its competitors in the meantime.
By contrast, NXP is benefiting from the global chip shortage and is anticipating strong double-digit growth this year. Shares are more ""expensive,"" but they reflect expanding sales and a rising bottom line as NXP reaches a more profitable scale. It also has significant exposure to the evolving auto industry and has a hand in trends like vehicle electrification and autonomy. At this juncture, I think NXP is the better buy.

2021-04-08 00:00:00+00:00,AMD Is Firing On All Cylinders Against Intel Once Again,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/amd-is-firing-on-all-cylinders-against-intel-once-again-2021-04-08,,,"Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) didn't have the best start to 2021 after it was reported that Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) has started turning the tide in the CPU (central processing unit) market with a small share gain in the fourth quarter of 2020. Chipzilla's turnaround led to concerns about AMD's ability to sustain its market share growth in 2021, especially after it was learned that the new Intel CEO could tweak the chip giant's strategy and expand the use of external foundries.
But the latest market share data from a credible source indicates that AMD continues to take share away from its bigger rival.
Let's take a look.
Image source: Getty Images.
AMD is eating into Intel's market share in 2021
AMD's CPU market share increased by 0.46 percentage points in March, and the company finished the month with 28.97% of the market under its control, according to the latest Steam Hardware survey. Intel controlled the rest of the market with a share of just over 71%.
It is interesting to note that AMD's market share has increased in the first three months of 2021. Intel had clawed back some share from its smaller rival in December 2020 and ended the year with 75% of the CPU market under its control. AMD has hit back and reclaimed lost ground with three consecutive monthly share gains.
Of course, investors should take the survey results with a pinch of salt as it is limited only to Steam users. But with Steam boasting 120 million monthly active users in 2020, the survey does provide some credible insights about the broader CPU market. So, it can be said that Intel's market share gain looks like a flash in the pan so far, as AMD has regained its mojo once again.
More gains are in the cards
Supply constraints had handicapped AMD in the fourth quarter of 2020, allowing Intel to grab some market share. But Chipzilla's gains were reportedly in the lower end of the market, and the company also reduced the prices of its processors to boost shipments. The strategy weighed on Intel's margins with its non-GAAP gross margin dropping 1.7 percentage points in the fourth quarter.
The company has stuck to this strategy, as it anticipates a four-percentage-point decline in gross margin in the first quarter as shipments of small core processors are expected to increase. AMD, on the other hand, is witnessing strong growth in the higher end of the processor market, shipping 1 million units of the Ryzen 5000 processors in just the final eight weeks of 2020 as per Mercury Research.
AMD is now looking to turn up the heat in the higher end of the PC processor market. Supply chain sources indicate that AMD could increase production of Ryzen 5000 parts by 20% in the second quarter of 2021 as compared to the first quarter. This could help AMD corner more market share, as its high-end processors are reportedly better than Intel's competing offerings as per third-party benchmarks.
That's not surprising, as AMD took the gaming CPU crown from Intel after the launch of the Ryzen 5000 series processors last year because of its technological advantage. More importantly, AMD is unlikely to lose its advantage over Intel anytime soon.
A combination of better availability and a superior product line will be tailwinds in AMD's fight for more market share against Intel. These tailwinds can help AMD claw away more market share from Chipzilla as the year progresses. So, don't be surprised to see AMD achieve the ambitious guidance that it has set for itself this year and become a top tech stock once again after a tepid performance on the market over the past few months.
