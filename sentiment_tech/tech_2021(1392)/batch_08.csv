2021-10-27 00:00:00+00:00,3 Industrial Stocks For Your November 2021 Watchlist,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-industrial-stocks-for-your-november-2021-watchlist-2021-10-27,,,"3 Top Industrial Stocks To Keep An Eye On Right Now
As the broader stock market soars toward newer heights this week, industrial stocks continue to gain momentum. For the most part, this would be thanks to the generally positive sentiment regarding the ongoing economic recovery. After all, industrial stocks are considered a key part of the cyclical stock group now. Because of this, an uptick in the economy would result in rising demands for their services and wares. For the uninitiated, industrial stocks belong to companies that produce materials used for manufacturing and construction alongside related services, in general. Given October’s consumer confidence index rebound, we could be looking at exciting times ahead for the sector now.
For instance, we could look at semiconductor giant, Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) now. Sure, some would consider the company’s latest update on its chip production operations less-than-ideal. As a result, the company’s are currently down by over 2% year-to-date. However, given the overwhelming need for Intel’s chip offerings across numerous global industries, investors could see an opportunity in INTC stock now. Just this week, Intel insiders including CEO Pat Gelsinger reportedly purchased $2.5 million in INTC stock. Even with the momentary setbacks, Intel has and continues to serve crucial industries across the board.
At the same time, there are also companies such as Caterpillar (NYSE: CAT) in the construction industry. This would be the case with the ongoing $1 trillion infrastructure bill being debated amongst House representatives. Should the bill be passed, CAT stock would be in focus as nationwide construction and maintenance efforts ramp up. By and large, with the current uptrend in the economy, industrial stocks could make viable plays. With that said, here are three to note in the stock market today.
Top Industrial Stocks To Buy [Or Sell] This Week
United Parcel Service Inc. (NYSE: UPS)
3M Company (NYSE: MMM)
General Electric Company (NYSE: GE)
United Parcel Service
For starters, we will be taking a look at United Parcel Service (UPS). In brief, it is a Georgia-based multinational shipping & receiving and supply chain management firm. For a sense of scale, UPS’ logistics solutions are currently available in over 220 countries and territories worldwide. As one of the world’s largest companies and the leading name in the shipping courier industry, UPS stock could be an industrial name to consider. In fact, the company’s shares surged by over 6% during intraday trading yesterday thanks to its latest quarterly report.
Diving right into it, the company posted an earnings per share of $2.71 on revenue of $23.2 billion. Notably, UPS beat consensus estimates of $2.54 and $22.6 billion respectively. Overall, the company appears to be gaining momentum heading into the holiday season, its busiest time of the year. The company cited strong e-commerce demand as a core growth driver for the quarter. Anticipating higher volumes during the year-end season, the company’s shipping prices have also increased accordingly. Thanks to all of this, UPS is raising its operating margin target to 13% for 2021.
Moreover, UPS’s latest acquisition of same-day delivery service provider, Roadie, paints a clearer picture regarding its plans for the quarter. Namely, the company appears to be more than prepping for busy times ahead as businesses of all sizes turn to its services. All things considered, would UPS stock be a top pick for you in the stock market now?

3M
Following that is 3M. In essence, the multinational conglomerate manufactures and markets a massive array of safety and industrial products. The likes of which range from materials and adhesives with diverse use cases. Among 3M’s core end markets are the worker safety, health care, and consumer goods sectors. Given the broad applications of 3M’s wares, MMM stock could arguably be a go-to for investors considering more defensive stocks.
Well, for one thing, the company continues to perform on the financial front now. Evidently, 3M posted solid figures in its third quarter earnings report yesterday before the opening bell. In it, the firm saw quarterly earnings per share of $2.45, beating Wall Street’s estimates by 25 cents. Additionally, 3M also posted a total revenue of $8.9 billion, topping projections of $8.7 billion.
In short, CEO Mike Roman had this to say, “Overall, end-market demand remained strong, and we navigated supply chain disruptions by maintaining a relentless focus on serving and innovating for our customers.” Regarding 3M’s long-term plans, Roman noted that it will continue to invest in its “strong demand areas” according to global trends. With the stock trading sideways for most of the year, would this be an opportune time to add MMM stock to your portfolio now?

General Electric
Last but not least, we have General Electric or GE for short. Similar to our previous entry, GE is a multinational conglomerate company. Accordingly, its operations span a vast number of industries. This includes but is not limited to aviation, health care, renewable energy, and power markets. To put things into perspective, GE’s core divisions across these sectors each raked in a total revenue of over $15 billion in 2020. GE stock has risen by more than 80% over the past year.
If anything, GE does not seem to be slowing down in the slightest. This is apparent given the company’s stellar earnings report yesterday. In detail, GE smashed analyst earnings projections with an earnings per share of $0.57. For comparison, Wall Street expected earnings of $0.14 per share for the quarter. CEO Lawrence Culp Jr. said, “The GE team delivered another strong quarter. Orders grew, margins expanded, our overall cash performance was significantly better, and Aviation is building momentum and showing continued signs of recovery.”
Not to mention, Culp Jr. also noted that the GE team is “managing through a challenging operating environment”, citing global supply chain disruptions. Despite all of this, the company is raising its 2021 earnings per share outlook. Moving forward, GE aims to maintain its leading positions across its core end markets. Given the overall momentum in GE’s operations, would you consider investing in GE stock this week?

Oct 26 (Reuters) - Advanced Micro Devices Inc AMD.O forecast fourth-quarter revenue above market expectations on Tuesday, betting that it would overcome supply chain snarls to meet strong demand for its chips used in PCs, gaming consoles and data center servers.
The company has tried to reduce losses from the supply chain crisis ailing the chip industry by redirecting supplies and zeroing in on selling only its most profitable chips.
It has also eaten into the market share of rivals by offering a new series of chips that outpace those from Intel Corp INTC.O.
The company said it expected current-quarter revenue of about $4.5 billion, plus or minus $100 million, compared with analysts' average estimate of $4.25 billion, according to Refinitiv data.
Its revenue for the third quarter of $4.31 billion was also higher than expectations of $4.12 billion.

Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.

STOCKHOLM, Oct 26 (Reuters) - Swedish automotive technology group Veoneer VNE.N, VNEsdb.ST reported on Tuesday a narrower third-quarter loss amid a global chip shortage and said it would no longer provide an outlook as it focused on its looming merger.
Chipmaker Qualcomm Inc QCOM.O and SSW Partners said this month they had reached an agreement to buy Veoneer for $4.5 billion.
The maker of vision systems, radars and software for advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) was hit hard by the outbreak of the pandemic. Demand has since broadly recovered, while the auto industry is facing a shortage of electronic components.
Veoneer, which competes with the likes of Aptiv APTV.N, Bosch, Continental CONG.DE and Mobileye INTC.O, said underlying demand for its products remained very strong, while semiconductor shortages and supply chain constraints continued to hamper growth.
""We are managing this situation daily, and are doing our utmost to support our customers through this difficult situation,"" Veoneer Chief Executive and Chairman Jan Carlson said in a statement.
Veoneer made an operating loss of $89 million versus a loss of $103 million in the year-ago quarter.
Qualcomm in August offered to buy the Sweden-based firm at an 18.4% premium to a July bid worth around $3.8 billion by Magna MG.TO that had already been accepted by Veoneer's board.

In the upcoming months, Intel will release new products that many investors and tech enthusiasts are excited about. Intel will be entering the discrete graphics card market with its Alchemist GPU and the accelerator AI market with its Ponte Vecchio GPU. Numerous products like consumer CPUs, data center CPUs, and more are also in Intel's pipeline.
Intel mentioned to its investors that original equipment manufacturers are focusing on higher-margin items due to component shortages. The component shortage has caused Intel to report a slowdown in its PC-centric business and pushed its stock price down.

2021-10-26 00:00:00+00:00,Is Intel Stock a Buy?,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/is-intel-stock-a-buy-2021-10-26,,,"Intel's (NASDAQ: INTC) stock tumbled nearly 12% on Oct. 22 after the chipmaker posted its third-quarter earnings report.
Its non-GAAP revenue, which excludes the upcoming sale of its NAND memory business to SK Hynix, rose 5% year over year to $18.1 billion, but missed expectations by $170 million. But its non-GAAP earnings still increased 59% to $1.71 per share, which easily beat expectations by $0.60.
Those results weren't disastrous, but they indicate Intel's ambitious turnaround plans have yet to bear any fruit. Let's review Intel's main challenges, and whether or not its stock is worth buying after its post-earnings plunge.
Image source: Intel
Intel's uphill battle
When Pat Gelsinger took the helm as Intel's new CEO in February, he immediately faced three major challenges.
First, Intel's foundries had fallen behind Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) (NYSE: TSM) and Samsung in the ""process race"" to manufacture smaller and more advanced chips. Intel had also repeatedly delayed its newer chips, resulting in shortages that infuriated its PC and data center customers. Gelsinger's predecessor, Bob Swan, had even considered entirely giving up on manufacturing chips to turn Intel into a ""fabless"" chipmaker that outsourced its production to TSMC.
Second, AMD (NASDAQ: AMD) -- which has been led by a visionary CEO and already outsourced the production of its chips to TSMC -- pulled ahead of Intel in the process race and proceeded to grow its market share in the PC and data center markets with its Ryzen and Epyc CPUs, respectively.
Lastly, the entire world was struggling with a shortage of chips. Intel's own technical limitations were contributing to that shortage, and it struggled to upgrade its own plants to meet the market's feverish demand for new chips.
An ongoing slowdown
Intel's revenue rose 8% in 2020. But all of that growth occurred in the first half of the year, as stay-at-home trends sparked sales of new PCs and the soaring usage of cloud services drove demand for new data center chips.
Intel's revenue then declined year over year in the third and fourth quarters of 2020 as its data center group (DCG) -- once considered to be the company's core growth engine -- struggled with declining sales.
The DCG business remained weak throughout the first half of 2021, mainly due to challenges in China and competitive pressure from AMD, and only returned to growth in the third quarter. Its client computing group (CCG) business, which mainly produces its PC CPUs, fared better in the first half as it benefited from pandemic-related tailwinds, but lost its momentum in the third quarter as other component shortages throttled sales of completed PCs.

Intel expects its non-GAAP revenue to decline 3% in the fourth quarter and rise just 1% for the full year. It expects its non-GAAP EPS to decline 41% in the fourth quarter and come in roughly flat for the full year.
By comparison, analysts expect AMD's revenue and earnings to surge 60% and 93%, respectively, this year.
Don't expect a quick recovery
Instead of turning Intel into a fabless chipmaker like AMD, Gelsinger is doubling down on Intel's manufacturing efforts by spending tens of billions of dollars on new plants and expanding its third-party foundry capabilities.
Intel believes that expansion, which it's pressing American and European governments to subsidize, will enable it to reclaim the process lead from TSMC and Samsung by 2025. It also believes the expansion of its plants will reduce the world's overall dependence on TSMC and Samsung.
During the conference call, Gelsinger said Intel was still in the ""early stages"" of that journey, but that its business was ""getting better every day."" However, Gelsinger also expects the chip shortage to drag on to 2023, and for Intel to boost its capital expenditure from $18-19 billion in 2021 to $25-$28 billion in 2022 to develop new chips and increase its capacity.
In other words, Intel will be significantly increasing its expenses as the chip shortage throttles its ability to sell new chips. Meanwhile, AMD simply needs to rely on TSMC's aggressive spending plans (with a target of $100 billion over the next three years) to stay ahead of Intel.
If Intel manages to reclaim the process lead, attract big subsidies, and pull fabless chipmakers away from TSMC and Samsung, Gelsinger's turnaround plan could pay off. But if it fails to achieve all three things, its growth could stagnate for years after the chip shortage ends.
Intel's stock is cheap for obvious reasons
Intel's stock might seem like a bargain at 9.3 times forward earnings, but it's cheap because its growth has stalled out. Its dividend yield of 2.7% might look tempting, but it could be reduced if Intel decides that cash ($4.2 billion in the first nine months of 2021) is better allocated toward capital expenditure.
I said it last month, and I'll say it again: The risks of owning Intel still outweigh the potential rewards. For now, investors should stick with other blue-chip tech stocks until green shoots actually start to appear at Intel.

TOKYO, Oct 25 (Reuters) - Japanese stocks dropped on Monday on disappointing earnings, with semiconductor-related shares among the hardest hit, taking their cue from falls in U.S. tech firms on poor earnings and concerns about the Federal Reserve's tapering.
The Nikkei 225 Index .N225 fell 204 points or 0.71% to 28,600.41, at one point slipping below 28,500 to a 10-day low. The broader Topix .TOPX was down 0.34 % at 1,995.42.
Semi-conductor stocks .MIJP0SE00PJP lost 0.94%, with Tokyo Electron 8035.T down 1.2% and Screen Holdings 7735.T falling 2% after U.S. Nasdaq shares .IXIC fell on Friday on disappointing quarterly reports from Snap SNAP.N and Intel Corp INTC.O. .N
The stocks that gained the most among the top 30 core Topix names included Recruit Holdings Co Ltd 6098.T, while underperformers included SoftBank Group Corp 9984.T, which was down 3.37%.
Japan's ruling coalition's defeat in Sunday's by-election was a surprise and discouraged market players from buying ahead of this week's general election, Koichi Kurose, chief strategist at Resona Asset Management, said.
The national election on Oct. 31 is key to whether new Prime Minister Fumio Kishida is able to go ahead with big spending plans for the economy, which is showing some signs of recovery.
The ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and its junior coalition partner currently have a near two-thirds majority of the 465 seats in the house. Kishida is hoping they retain a majority, despite an opposition candidate winning one of two upper house by-elections at the weekend.
Richly-valued U.S. tech shares had also come under pressure after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell discussed stimulus tapering.
Some Japanese corporate earnings on Friday also struck a downbeat note and Canon Electronics 7739.T was flat after nine-month earnings fell well short of the full 2021 targets.
Ube Industries 4208.T dropped 3.4% after the chemical firm trimmed its annual net profit outlook even as it boosted its top-line forecast.
Stanley Electric 6923.T ended flat after the maker of automobile lighting equipment maker lowered its earnings outlook for the half year that ended in September, citing a global plunge in car production and rising costs.
But Tokyo Steel 5423.T jumped almost 16% after the steelmaker bumped up its annual profit outlook and boosted dividend estimates.

HONG KONG, Oct 25 (Reuters) - Asian shares edged higher on Monday ahead of a week packed with major quarterly earnings announcements though news of trials of a property tax in China weighed on Hong Kong and mainland Chinese markets.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS rose 0.26% while Japan's Nikkei .N225 lost 1% on softer earnings by several local companies.
Australian .AXJOshares rose 0.47%, supported by miners, while South Korea .KS11was up 0.5%, though these gains were balanced by more muted moves in Greater China.
Chinese blue chips .CSI300 were flat, though an real estate index .CSI000952 shed 3%, while the Hong Kong benchmark .HSI gained 0.18% despite a 2.6% fall in an index of Hong Kong listed mainland property firms .HSMPI.
The property stock declines followed a Saturday announcement by China's parliament's top decision-making body that will roll out a pilot real estate tax in some regions.
Embattled developer China Evergrande Group last week appeared to avert a costly default with a last-minute bond coupon payment, and Reuters reported Monday that some bond holders had received payment.
""Although we had some news on the Evergrande front, I think we will see more pressure on the property sector, especially the smaller guys,"" said Carlos Casanova Asia economist at UBP pointing to authorities’ efforts to ensure a correction in house prices, and the expansion of plans for a pilot property tax at a time when many property companies had bonds maturing in the coming months.
Also on investors' minds is a string of company earnings due this week. HSBC 0005.HKHSBA.L and Facebook FB.O will both publish quarterly results on Monday, in Asian trading and late U.S. hours respectively.
Later in the week will be the turn of other benchmark heavyweights including tech giants Microsoft MSFT.O, Apple AAPL.O and Alphabet GOOGL.O, and European and Asian financial behemoths from Deutsche Bank DBKGn.DE and Lloyds LLOY.L to China Construction Bank 606939.SS and Nomura 8604.T.
""This week earnings take centre stage,"" said Chris Weston, head of research at brokerage Pepperstone in Melbourne, in a morning note.
The results will be closely watched after a strong start to the U.S. earnings season for many companies, especially financials, helped both the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI and the S&P 500 .SPX touch record highs last week, though the Nasdaq .IXIC fell on Friday after Snap SNAP.N and Intel Corp's INTC.O quarterly results disappointed.
The risk friendlier mood that supported equities has weighed on safe-haven currencies, as have rising energy prices which supported currencies including the Aussie AUD=D3 and Canadian dollars CAD=.
The dollar index =USD was last at 93.521, down 0.15% on the day, heading towards its month low of 93.455 hit last week, and well off mid-October's 12-month high.
Traders are waiting for U.S. third quarter GDP figures due Thursday with a weak print likely to weigh on the dollar, according to analysts at CBA.
In contrast, UBP's Casanova said a strong reading could push U.S. benchmark yields higher and drive sooner-than-expected tightening by U.S. policy makers.
Markets are still trying to position themselves for a widely expected tapering of the U.S. stimulus programme this year, and the possibility of rate hikes late in 2022
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Friday said the U.S. central bank should start the process of reducing its support of the economy by cutting back on its asset purchases, but should not yet touch interest rates.
As tapering looms, U.S. benchmark yields have been rising and yields on 10-year Treasury notes US10YT=RR hit a five-month high of 1.7064% last week. In early Asia they were last 1.6421%.
Oil prices rose on Monday, extending pre-weekend gains, with U.S. crude hitting a seven-year high as global supply remained tight amid strong demand worldwide.
Brent crude LCOc1 rose 0.88% to $86.28 a barrel, while U.S. crude .CLc1 rose 1.11% to $84.69, a new seven-month high.
Spot gold XAU= rose 0.3% to $1,797 an ounce after posting gains for the past two weeks on rising inflation concerns.
Bitcoin BTC=BTSP another asset oft-described as an inflation hedge was last at $61,901 up 1.6% after last week's turbulent trade when it hit a new high of $67,016.

HONG KONG, Oct 25 (Reuters) - Asian shares started steady on Monday ahead of a week packed with major quarterly earnings announcements, while the dollar hovered near October lows after three weeks of risk-friendly sentiment hurt safe-haven currencies.
HSBC 0005.HKHSBA.L and Facebook FB.O will both publish quarterly results on Monday, in Asian trading and late U.S. hours respectively.

MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS has also posted gains in the past three weeks, which if it can hold onto them this week, would make October the benchmark's best month of 2022.
On Monday morning, the regional benchmark was flat with a 0.5% gain in Australia .AXJO balanced by a 0.6% fall in Korea .KS11.
Japan's Nikkei .N225 lost 1% and U.S. S&P 500 futures ESc1 shed 0.18%.
Asian shares have largely lagged their U.S. and European counterparts in recent months mainly due to regulatory ructions and fears of slowing growth in China.
In the latest announcement to worry some investors, the top decision-making body of the Chinese parliament said on Saturday it will roll out a pilot real estate tax in some regions.
Analysts at Citi summed up the announcement as an ""earlier than expected trial but later than expected national rollout; no devastating impact.""
However, the risk friendlier mood that supported equities has weighed on safe-haven currencies, as have rising energy prices which supported currencies like the Aussie AUD=D3 and Canadian dollars CAD=.
The dollar index =USD was last at 93.667, hovering near its month low of 93.455 hit last week, and well off mid-October's 12-month high.
However, analysts at CBA said it was more likely the dollar would rise than fall from here.
""Dollar risks remain skewed to the upside,"" they wrote in a note citing rising expectations of inflation from markets, consumers and policy makers, meaning markets are pricing a more aggressive programme of interest rate hikes, which would support the dollar.

NEW YORK, Oct 22 (Reuters) - Investors are homing in on a flood of earnings reports from Wall Street’s tech and Internet giants, as the high-growth stocks that have led markets higher for years face pressures from regulation, supply-chain snags and rising Treasury yields.
Apple Inc AAPL.O, Microsoft Corp MSFT.O, Google parent Alphabet Inc GOOGL.O, Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O and Facebook Inc FB.O are all set to report earnings next week. Collectively, those five names account for over 22% of the weighting in the S&P 500, giving their stock moves enormous sway over the broader index.
Overall, companies representing 46% of the S&P 500's market value are due to post quarterly results next week, according to Goldman Sachs.
Strong earnings reports have helped lift the S&P 500 .SPX to fresh record highs, with the benchmark index rising 5.5% so far in October. In September, the index posted its biggest monthly percentage drop since the pandemic began in March 2020.
While investors expect most of the big technology firms to show robust profits, many will also be listening for indications of whether they will be able to sustain that growth. Also in focus will be any forecasts regarding supply bottlenecks, such as the chip shortage that has affected a broad swath of global industries, as well as their views on how sustainable the recent surge in consumer prices will be.
There have already been some signs that tech companies may have a high bar to clear. Intel INTC.O and IBM IBM.N fell sharply after their reports disappointed this week.
Meanwhile, shares of Facebook fell 5% on Friday after Snap Inc SNAP.N, the owner of photo messaging app Snapchat, said privacy changes implemented by Apple on iOS devices hurt its ability to target and measure its digital advertising.
""I would expect the potential for more volatility,"" said James Ragan, director of wealth management research at D.A. Davidson. ""We just might get the possibility for some of these big companies to disappoint a little bit.""
The market's gains this month have been led by sectors seen as particularly sensitive to swings in the economy, including energy .SPNY and financials .SPSY, which have gained 11% and 8%, respectively. The S&P 500 technology sector is up 6% month-to-date.
Many tech-focused companies received a boost in the wake of the pandemic, amid a shift in consumer behavior amid economic lockdowns and a move to working from home.
""The question then becomes, can they keep it up?” said Sameer Samana, seniorglobal marketstrategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. ""What do the growth rates look like for large tech?""
A BofA Global Research survey showed earlier this month that fund managers are slightly underweight technology relative to their average positioning of the past 20 years. At the same time, they named “long tech” as the market’s most crowded trade for the fourth straight month.
Supply-chain issues including the semiconductor shortage are sure to be a topic for iPhone maker Apple, while Amazon could give a window into how the holiday shopping season may be hit by logistics snags.
""If ... Apple says, 'Yeah, we would have sold a lot more phones except for the chip shortage,' you think it’s really severe then because they are probably first in line to get chips from everybody,” said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel.
The prospect of U.S. government regulatory intervention, also hangs over these behemoth companies, so investors will be keen for any insight.
This week, the U.S. consumer watchdog said it has demanded information from a number of tech giants on how they gather and use consumer payment data.
A sustained rise in Treasury yields, which move inversely to bond prices, may also pose a longer-term threat to technology and other growth shares. Valuations of those companies rely more on future cash flows, which are discounted more acutely in standard models when yields rise. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note US10YT=RR has risen about 35 basis points in the past month to 1.64%.
""It hasn’t been all good news on the earnings front,"" wrote Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities. ""So far the good news has won the tug of war against the bad, but we have a long and potentially bumpy road in front of us.""

Oct 22 (Reuters) - The S&P 500 and Nasdaq were in the red on Friday after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell discussed stimulus tapering while disappointing quarterly reports from Snap Inc SNAP.N and Intel Corp INTC.O pushed the communications and technology sectors lower.
The Dow and the S&P 500 started to lose ground after hitting record highs earlier in what became a choppy trading day.
Stocks pulled back further while Powell was speaking but went on to pare losses after hitting a session low in late morning. Powell said the U.S. central bank was ""on track"" to begin reducing its purchases of assets.
""Powell's continuing on his data-driven approach and didn't appear incrementally more hawkish,"" said Sean Sun, portfolio manager at Thornburg Investment Management in Santa Fe, New Mexico.
But Sun said investors were ""really anxious"" about weaker than expected earnings at Snap, which attributed some weakness in its advertising business to global supply-chain disruptions and labor shortages that caused brands to pull back on their advertising spending.
This caused shareholders to exit other communications companies such as Facebook Inc FB.O, which was down 6%, and Twitter Inc TWTR.N, down 4.4%, as they also depend heavily on advertising revenue. As a result the S&P's communications services index .SPLRCL was the biggest decliner among the benchmark's 11 major sectors, down more than 2%.

Intel was down 12% after it missed third-quarter sales expectations, while its chief executive officer pointed to shortages of chips holding back sales of its flagship processors.

Still, the benchmark S&P 500 index .SPX, which boasted a record closing high on Thursday, was set for its third straight week of gains.
Eight of the S&P sector indexes were flat or gaining by late afternoon but consumer discretionary .SPLRCD was also falling along with the technology index .SPLRCT, which includes Intel.
The financial sector .SPSY was the biggest percentage gainer with help from American Express Co AXP.N, which jumped 6%, as it beat profit estimates for the fourth straight quarter.
Analysts increased their expectations for S&P 500 earnings growth for the third quarter, forecasting an increase of 34.8% year-on-year, up from an expected 31.9% rise at the beginning of the week, according to data from Refinitiv.
Data showed U.S. business activity accelerated in October, as COVID-19 infections subsided, though labor and raw material shortages held back manufacturing.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.17-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.50-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted 83 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 126 new highs and 122 new lows.

NEW YORK, Oct 22 (Reuters) - Global stock indexes were mostly flat to higher on Friday, with financial shares providing some support to the S&P 500 index in early trading, while the U.S. dollar slipped against a basket of currencies.
MSCI's broadest gauge of global shares .MIWD00000PUS and the S&P 500 both were on track for a third straight week of gains.
Investors also digested news that China Evergrande Group 3333.HK appeared to have averted default with a last-minute bond coupon payment, a source said on Friday.
In the foreign exchange market, investors continued to unload long positions that benefited from rising expectations the Federal Reserve will raise rates sooner than previously thought.
""There’s a bit of a positioning unwind taking place. We've obviously seen a firmer dollar since the September,"" Fed meeting, said Mazen Issa, senior FX strategist at TD Securities in New York. ""That also dovetails with the seasonal tendency for the dollar to soften into the end of the month.""
The Fed has signalled it could start to taper stimulus as soon as next month, with rate hikes to follow late next year.
The dollar index =USD fell 0.17% to 93.57, and is down from a one-year high of 94.56 last week.
On Wall Street, the financial sector .SPSY was up 0.9%, while Intel INTC.O shares fell and were a drag on the market. Late Thursday, Intel reported sales that missed expectations. It also pointed to shortages of chips holding back sales of its flagship processors.
Next week brings reports from several key mega-cap names including Amazon AMZN.O, and bullish investors are hoping they can follow some forecast-beating earnings from others so far this earnings season.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 85.49 points, or 0.24%, to 35,688.57, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 0.42 points, or 0.01%, to 4,549.36 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 72.97 points, or 0.48%, to 15,142.73.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index .STOXX rose 0.66% and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.10%.
Data on Friday showed euro zone inflation expectations are at their highest in years, amid a rash of warnings from companies including Nestle NESN.S, ABB ABBN.S and Unilever ULVR.L.
In the U.S. bond market, yields on longer-dated U.S. Treasuries edged lower.
The yield on 10-year Treasury notes US10YT=RR was down 0.5 basis points to 1.670% after rising to a five-month high of 1.7064% late Thursday.
U.S. crude CLc1 rose 0.57% to $82.97 per barrel and Brent LCOc1 was at $85.08, up 0.56% on the day.
U.S. gold futures GCc1 gained 1.44% to $1,806.90 an ounce.
Also, bitcoin BTC=BTSP fell 1.15% to $61,503.91.

2021-10-22 00:00:00+00:00,Here's Why Intel Shares Crashed Today,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/heres-why-intel-shares-crashed-today-2021-10-22,,,"What happened
Shares of semiconductor giant Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) fell as much as 11.7% on Friday following the company's third-quarter earnings report. The financial figures in this mixed report were solid enough, but Intel's ambitious turnaround plan left many investors more fearful than inspired.
So what
Intel's third-quarter sales fell 1.1% year over year to $18.1 billion. Adjusted earnings jumped 54%, landing at $1.71 per diluted share. Your average analyst had been looking for earnings near $1.11 per share on revenue in the neighborhood of $18.2 billion.

Some Intel owners may have expected management to present a quick fix to the restricted top-line growth and modest bottom-line profits in this report, but they walked away disappointed. Instead, CEO Pat Gelsinger said that Intel is using this slow and challenging period to suit up for a robust long-term opportunity.
""The digitization of everything accelerated by the four superpowers of AI, pervasive connectivity, cloud-to-edge infrastructure and ubiquitous compute are driving the sustained need for more semiconductors, and the market is expected to double to $1 trillion by 2030,"" Gelsinger said on the earnings call. ""We are one of the few companies with both the technical and financial resources to win in a market that is increasingly leading edge and challenged by the extreme physics of rejuvenating and continuing Moore's law.""
Now what
Gelsinger's vision for the long haul is both expensive and slow in the early innings. Intel has broken ground on several new chip manufacturing plants and signed up a couple of top-tier clients for its brand-new role as manufacturer of other companies' chip designs. These efforts play into the extended strategy shift.
And they don't come cheap. Intel now plans to funnel between $25 billion and $28 billion into capital expenses in 2022, followed by even higher cash investments in the next couple of years. To put these figures into context, Intel's record for annual capital expenses stopped at $16.2 billion in 2020:

I'm not surprised to see investors focus on the near-term cash costs of Intel's demanding infrastructure investments, so today's price drop makes sense even in the light of a perfectly decent earnings report. At the same time, I'm excited to see Intel take full advantage of the revamped and upgraded business platform the company is building right now. For us long-term investors, Intel looks like a fantastic buy today at just nine times trailing earnings.

NEW YORK, Oct 22 (Reuters) - Investors are homing in on a flood of earnings reports from Wall Street’s tech and Internet giants, as the high-growth stocks that have led markets higher for years face pressures from regulation, supply-chain snags and rising Treasury yields.
Apple Inc AAPL.O, Microsoft Corp MSFT.O, Google parent Alphabet Inc GOOGL.O, Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O and Facebook Inc FB.O are all set to report earnings next week. Collectively, those five names account for over 22% of the weighting in the S&P 500, giving their stock moves enormous sway over the broader index.
Overall, companies representing 46% of the S&P 500's market value are due to post quarterly results next week, according to Goldman Sachs.
Strong earnings reports have helped lift the S&P 500 .SPX to fresh record highs, with the benchmark index rising 5.5% so far in October. In September, the index posted its biggest monthly percentage drop since the pandemic began in March 2020.
While investors expect most of the big technology firms to show robust profits, many will also be listening for indications of whether they will be able to sustain that growth. Also in focus will be any forecasts regarding supply bottlenecks, such as the chip shortage that has affected a broad swath of global industries, as well as their views on how sustainable the recent surge in consumer prices will be.
There have already been some signs that tech companies may have a high bar to clear. Intel INTC.O and IBM IBM.N fell sharply after their reports disappointed this week.
Meanwhile, shares of Facebook fell 5% on Friday after Snap Inc SNAP.N, the owner of photo messaging app Snapchat, said privacy changes implemented by Apple on iOS devices hurt its ability to target and measure its digital advertising.
""I would expect the potential for more volatility,"" said James Ragan, director of wealth management research at D.A. Davidson. ""We just might get the possibility for some of these big companies to disappoint a little bit.""
The market's gains this month have been led by sectors seen as particularly sensitive to swings in the economy, including energy .SPNY and financials .SPSY, which have gained 11% and 8%, respectively. The S&P 500 technology sector is up 6% month-to-date.
Many tech-focused companies received a boost in the wake of the pandemic, amid a shift in consumer behavior amid economic lockdowns and a move to working from home.
""The question then becomes, can they keep it up?” said Sameer Samana, seniorglobal marketstrategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. ""What do the growth rates look like for large tech?""
A BofA Global Research survey showed earlier this month that fund managers are slightly underweight technology relative to their average positioning of the past 20 years. At the same time, they named “long tech” as the market’s most crowded trade for the fourth straight month.
Supply-chain issues including the semiconductor shortage are sure to be a topic for iPhone maker Apple, while Amazon could give a window into how the holiday shopping season may be hit by logistics snags.
""If ... Apple says, 'Yeah, we would have sold a lot more phones except for the chip shortage,' you think it’s really severe then because they are probably first in line to get chips from everybody,” said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel.
The prospect of U.S. government regulatory intervention, also hangs over these behemoth companies, so investors will be keen for any insight.
This week, the U.S. consumer watchdog said it has demanded information from a number of tech giants on how they gather and use consumer payment data.
A sustained rise in Treasury yields, which move inversely to bond prices, may also pose a longer-term threat to technology and other growth shares. Valuations of those companies rely more on future cash flows, which are discounted more acutely in standard models when yields rise. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note US10YT=RR has risen about 35 basis points in the past month to 1.64%.
""It hasn’t been all good news on the earnings front,"" wrote Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities. ""So far the good news has won the tug of war against the bad, but we have a long and potentially bumpy road in front of us.""

Oct 22 (Reuters) - The S&P 500 and Nasdaq closed lower on Friday as disappointing quarterly reports from Snap Inc SNAP.N and Intel Corp INTC.O dragged down the communications and technology sectors and investors turned skittish as Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell discussed stimulus tapering.
After hitting record highs in morning trading the Dow and the S&P 500 lost ground in a choppy session.
Stocks pulled back further while Powell was speaking but went on to pare losses after hitting a late morning low. Powell said the U.S. central bank was ""on track"" to begin reducing its purchases of assets.
""Powell's continuing on his data-driven approach and didn't appear incrementally more hawkish,"" said Sean Sun, portfolio manager at Thornburg Investment Management in Santa Fe, New Mexico.
But Sun said investors were ""really anxious"" about weaker than expected earnings at Snap, which attributed some weakness in its advertising business to global supply-chain disruptions and labor shortages that caused brands to pull back on their advertising spending.
This caused shareholders to exit other communications companies such as Facebook Inc FB.O and Twitter Inc TWTR.N, which also depend heavily on advertising revenue.
As a result the S&P's communications services index .SPLRCL was the biggest drag on the benchmark index during the session.
""Consumers want to open their wallets and buy things but they can't if goods are stuck on container ships. And advertisers aren't going to advertise things they can't sell,"" said Sun, noting that growth stocks were down in sympathy.
""Investors are now thinking about risk reward and valuations in growth stocks leave less room for disappointment.""
Intel shares also tumbled after the company missed third-quarter sales expectations, while its chief executive officer pointed to shortages of chips holding back sales of its flagship processors.
According to preliminary data, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 4.80 points, or 0.11%, to end at 4,544.98 points, while the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC lost 125.50 points, or 0.83%, to 15,090.20. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 74.17 points, or 0.21%, to 35,677.25.
Still, the benchmark S&P 500 index, which boasted a record closing high on Thursday, looked set for its third straight week of gains.
Among the S&P's major sectors, consumer discretionary .SPLRCD was a drag as Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O fell and Intel helped push down the high-profile technology index .SPLRCT.
The financial sector .SPSY was helped however by strong gains in American Express Co AXP.N after it beat profit estimates for the fourth straight quarter.
Analysts increased their expectations for S&P 500 earnings growth for the third quarter, forecasting an increase of 34.8% year-on-year, up from an expected 31.9% rise at the beginning of the week, according to data from Refinitiv.
But investors are already looking beyond the impressive earnings numbers, according to Brad McMillan, chief investment officer for Commonwealth Financial Network, an independent broker-dealer in Waltham, Massachusetts.
""The real question around whether we can push higher is going to be whether economy is going to get better, because the earnings are backwards-looking,"" McMillan said.
Data showed U.S. business activity accelerated in October, as COVID-19 infections subsided, though labor and raw material shortages held back manufacturing.

Oct 22 (Reuters) - The S&P 500 and Nasdaq closed lower on Friday as disappointing quarterly reports from Snap Inc SNAP.N and Intel Corp INTC.O put pressure on the communications and technology sectors and investors turned skittish as Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell discussed stimulus tapering.
The Dow managed to end the day with a record closing high for the first time since Aug. 16, but all three indexes had lost ground in morning trading while Powell was speaking but went on to pare losses in a choppy session.
Powell said the U.S. central bank was ""on track"" to begin reducing its purchases of assets.
Sean Sun, portfolio manager at Thornburg Investment Management in Santa Fe, New Mexico said Powell ""didn't appear incrementally more hawkish.""
But Sun said investors were ""really anxious"" about weaker than expected earnings at Snap, which attributed some weakness in its advertising business to global supply-chain disruptions and labor shortages that caused brands to pull back on their advertising spending.
Snap shares fell more than 25% and its report caused shareholders to exit bigger advertising dependent communications companies such as Facebook Inc FB.O and Twitter Inc TWTR.N, which both closed down around 5%.
As a result the S&P's communications services index .SPLRCL was the biggest drag on the benchmark index.
""Consumers want to open their wallets and buy things but they can't if goods are stuck on container ships. And advertisers aren't going to advertise things they can't sell,"" said Sun, noting that growth stocks were down in sympathy.
""Investors are now thinking about risk reward and valuations in growth stocks leave less room for disappointment.""
Intel shares tumbled almost 12% after the computer chip maker missed third-quarter sales expectations, while its chief executive officer pointed to shortages of chips holding back sales of its flagship processors.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 73.94 points, or 0.21%, to 35,677.02, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 4.88 points, or 0.11%, to 4,544.9 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 125.50 points, or 0.82%, to 15,090.20.
Still, all three indexes notched a third straight week of gains for the first time since early July, with the S&P adding 1.6% for the week while the Dow climbed 1.1% and the Nasdaq advanced by 1.3%.
Among the S&P's major sectors on Friday, consumer discretionary .SPLRCD was a drag as Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O fell and Intel helped push down the high-profile technology index .SPLRCT.
The financial sector .SPSY was helped, however, by strong gains in American Express Co AXP.N, which rose 5.4% after it beat profit estimates for the fourth straight quarter.
Analysts increased their expectations for S&P 500 earnings growth for the third quarter, forecasting an increase of 34.8% year-on-year, up from an expected 31.9% rise at the beginning of the week, according to data from Refinitiv.
But some investors were already looking beyond the impressive earnings numbers, according to Brad McMillan, chief investment officer for Commonwealth Financial Network, an independent broker-dealer in Waltham, Massachusetts.
""The real question around whether we can push higher is going to be whether economy is going to get better, because the earnings are backwards-looking,"" McMillan said.
Data showed U.S. business activity accelerated in October, as COVID-19 infections subsided, though labor and raw material shortages held back manufacturing.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.08-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.30-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted 88 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 142 new highs and 137 new lows.
On U.S. exchanges 11.03 billion shares changed hands compared with the 10.38 billion moving average for the last 20 seconds.
