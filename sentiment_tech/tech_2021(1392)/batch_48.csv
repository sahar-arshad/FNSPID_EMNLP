Jan 8 (Reuters) - Intel Corp INTC.O plans to tap Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co 2330.TW to make a second generation discrete graphics chip for personal computers that it hopes will help it combat the rise of Nvidia Corp NVDA.O, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.
The chip, known as ""DG2"", will be made on a new chipmaking process at TSMC that has not yet been formally named but is an enhanced version of its 7-nanometer process, the two people familiar the matter said.
Intel, long the world leader in chip-making technology, has lost its manufacturing edge in recent years and is now debating whether to outsource some of it flagship central processor unit chips, or CPUs, slated for release in 2023.
Activist investor Third Point LLC last month sent Intel's board a letter asking it to consider whether to keep its chip design and manufacturing operations under one roof.
Intel has long outsourced chips other than its flagship CPUs and is a major customer of TSMC, the world's leading contract chip manufacturer. The head of Intel's self-driving subsidiary Mobileye last month told Reuters that its next autonomous vehicle processor will be continue to be manufactured by TSMC on its 7-nanometer process.
With its graphics chips, Intel is looking to tap into the booming PC gaming market. Its DG2 chip is expected to be released late this year or in early 2022 and compete with Nvidia and AMD gaming chips that cost between $400 and $600, the sources said.
The chip manufacturing technology for the DG2 is expected to be more advanced than the Samsung Electronics Co Ltd 005930.KS 8-nanometer process used in Nvidia's most recent round of graphics chips released in the fall, the people said. They added it would also have a leg up on the Advanced Micro Devices graphics chips made on TSMC's 7-nanometer process.
Intel declined to comment and TSMC said it does not comment on individual customers.
Intel officials last year said that it would outsource the DG2 chip but did not say which chip manufacturer had won the business or which chipmaking process it would use.

2021-01-12 00:00:00+00:00,Why Luminar Technologies Should Be Bought on Weakness,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-luminar-technologies-should-be-bought-on-weakness-2021-01-12,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Finding new growth stocks can be a risky endeavor. This is the case with Luminar Technologies (NASDAQ:LAZR) and with LAZR stock.
Source: Oskari Porkka/ShutterStock.com
At first glance, LAZR stock appears to be attractive – a slam dunk, even. But first impressions can turn out to be wrong in many circumstances. And an investor’s relationship with a company is one such situation. There’s really no way to know for sure how the relationship is going to work out. So, investors are left with their research and experience to guide them.
When it comes to Luminar, the outlook is mixed.
A Look at LAZR Stock
Luminar Technologies is fairly new to the stock market. The company went public by merging with a special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC.
When a SPAC deal occurs, a specially purposed acquisition company conducts an initial public offering. It  has a limited time to merge with a private partner. When a partner is found and the merger takes place, the acquisition company then fades away. The formerly private firm remains, gets a ticker and is traded in an equity market.

This process is usually cheaper and easier than the traditional IPO. However, SPACs are not as transparent as companies that conduct IPOs. That’s because investors do not have the same amount of information that is available from an IPO.
SPACs became fashionable during 2020. This was especially the case in the electric-vehicle segment, where several nascent EV hopefuls used SPACs to reach the market.
Although LAZR stock arrived via a SPAC merger, Luminar is not an EV company. But it is involved in the transportation industry, and its products may very well be used in EVs to enable assisted and autonomous-driving systems.
Luminar, based in Orlando, Florida, went public in December 2020. After hovering in the $10 range, the shares began climbing in the weeks prior to the reverse merger.
LAZR stock surged once the company reached the market and then fell for half a week or so before partially recovering its loss. The stock’s range so far is $9.45 to $47.80. The shares closed yesterday at $31.46.
The company’s market cap is about $10.2 billion.
One for the Road
Luminar developed a system called lidar, which means light detection and ranging. The laser system helps an autonomous vehicle to see. It works differently than the camera-based systems deployed by Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA).
The existence of competing systems is not uncommon in a developing technology. Companies are working feverishly to prove their ideas and bring them to the emerging marketplace.
And that is especially true in this emerging segment. Ultimately, the market may consolidate around one or two offerings, but this is a long way off. In addition, it’s also possible that vehicle manufacturers will utilize a combination of tools and seek the benefits they offer.
Also, although Luminar is not the only lidar producer, it is considered by many to be the leader of the sector. The other leading contender is Velodyne (NASDAQ:VLDR).
However, InvestorPlace contributor Luke Lango reported recently that Luminar holds a competitive advantage because of its product’s cost and performance. He also says that LAZR stock could be a big winner in the next few years. He wrote:
“Self-driving is quickly becoming a reality. LiDAR sensors will be the technology backbone of the self-driving revolution. Luminar makes the best and most economic LiDAR sensors in the market. The company’s sensors will inevitabl{y} be outfitted on million and millions of cars over the next several years.”
Meanwhile, Luminar is working with Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) subsidiary MobileEye on that company’s driverless vehicle project. LAZR stock recently dipped when it looked as if MobileEye was moving ahead without Luminar. Those fears were eased, but a separation looks possible as MobilEye’s project moves ahead.
The Bottom Line
Luminar Technologies makes laser-based systems, known as lidar, for assisted and autonomous driving systems. The company’s products are viewed as top-flight, and many observers believe its future is bright.
Luminar is new to the stock market, having arrived only last month through a SPAC merger. Its shares surged quickly, then fell, and recovered some of their losses.
Investors should expect volatility from a new listing and this is no exception. Nevertheless, LAZR stock merits a place in diversified portfolios with a long-term outlook and tolerance for risk. With that in mind, it’s a buy on future dips.

Jan 12 (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures resumed their climb on Tuesday as investors looked to the earnings season this week for clues on the health of Corporate America and the economy while awaiting details on the next package of official economic stimulus.
Wall Street's main indexes ended off all-time highs on Monday as investors worried that attempts to impeach President Donald Trump could delay the Joe Biden administration's first moves on stimulus, spurring some profit-taking on the past month's gains.
Democrats will give Trump one last chance on Tuesday to leave office days before his term expires or face an unprecedented second impeachment over his supporters' storming of the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6.
Fourth-quarter earnings will take center-stage starting on Friday, with results from JPMorgan JPM.N, Citigroup C.N and other big banks launching the reporting season.
Earnings for S&P 500 companies are expected to have dropped 9.8% year-over-year in the final quarter of 2020, according to IBES data from Refinitiv, but they are expected to rebound in 2021, with a gain of 16.4% projected for the first quarter.
At 6:53 a.m. ET, Dow E-minis 1YMcv1 were up 66 points, or 0.21% and S&P 500 E-minis EScv1 were up 9 points, or 0.24%. Nasdaq 100 E-minis NQcv1 were up 39.5 points, or 0.31%.

Hopes of a big boost to public spending and speedy rollout of vaccines under a Democratic-led U.S. Congress have pushed Wall Street to record highs, with growth-linked financial, industrial and energy stocks leading the market higher.
However, investors are weighing how much further the rally in so-called value stocks can run, after a year in which they have trailed behind technology and other ""stay-at-home"" winners from the coronavirus crisis.

Over the years I’ve written a lot about Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and AMD stock. Most times it was on the bullish side. I will remain consistent with my assessment of it suggesting it’s a stock to hold for the future.
AMD) logo outside of a corporate building"" width=""300"" height=""169"">
Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com
If the stock markets are higher ten years from now then AMD stock is in the lead. But I am not a perma-bull because I’ve occasionally shared a few concerning stints. Under the leadership of Dr. Lisa Su Wall Street loves owning it. It has its critics but I think they are wrong to expect failure from this management team. The opportunity is too strong.
2020 was a disaster for humans but it was a gigantic gift for technology. We’ve been in a digital revolution for decades but the pandemic made the ramp of it exponential. There is no doubt that everyone is rushing to get “online” with whatever they are doing. Therefore demand for tech products and services will remain strong for years.
AMD is one of few companies who supply the brains for said tech. There is enough elbow room for it, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and even Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) to prosper. Barriers to entry at this scale are significant but even then, they can all thrive.
AMD Stock Price Action Is Orderly
Source: Charts by TradingView
In December I suggested that there was no obvious point of entry then. It wasn’t a bearish article per se but I cautioned about timing. In it, I suggested that AMD would make a better buy closer to $88 per share. That was what happened as AMD stock fell 8% and bounced twice off of my support.
The 7 Best Marijuana Stocks on the Markets Right Now
Here it is now challenging the same highs once again with an opportunity to break into three digits. However I have to renew my caution against blindly chasing it for short-term gain. My trading strategy would be to either buy the rip above the prior fail, or buy the dip into support. Either way it’s a bullish bet with two different trigger points or approaches.
Those who want to own it for a very long time can buy it and ignore the short-term blips. Over a decade, it’s not going to matter much a few dollars higher or lower than current price. But for traders who prefer entering stocks before rallies then it behooves us to try to find favorable zones. AMD stock remains my pick of the litter when it comes to chip stocks. But for new positions I would wait out the next couple of weeks.
At the very least I don’t enter a full size position right here and now. We have to remember that the risk is not all from within the company. It has excellent prospects but it has to trade in the prism of an entire market. The indices cannot stop breaking records even on deteriorating conditions. There is a possibility of a correction and that would bring pain to AMD stock regardless of its particular situation.
Cheap Is Not Always a Good Thing
Fundamentally it’s not cheap, but that’s not a problem for me. Its three-digit P/E scares a lot of investors. Growth doesn’t come cheap. I’ve made that argument over and again using Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) as an example. For a decade experts called it expensive and demanded it cut spending. Had they heeded that advice, the world would not have gotten AWS, which houses the cloud as we know it now. AMD and Nvidia are trying to reinvent the future, and that requires expenses. Great ideas are taxing on the companies that are trying to bring them to fruition.
Expectations matter because often perception trumps reality. In AMD stock’s case the buyers are somewhat realistic. The price-to-sales is still under control and much cheaper than Nvidia. If the bulls are realistic then the odds of disappointment is relatively low.
Even though it’s not dirt cheap, it is definitely not flagrant. Wall Street is full of bloat among newer companies these days. Competition is fierce but it’s a tight field. It’s been a two horse race among three giants. Intel is now badly lagging but it’s still in it. All three will push each other hard so collectively they will go farther.
I’d own AMD for the long term. Otherwise, I’m a buyer of AMD stock on dips. Meanwhile I watch for upside triggers to chase. For the traders among us a break above into a new all-time high will bring another wave of buyers. Therefore my earlier caution was definitely not a call to short it. I am merely opting out of going all in at a point where it’s not an obvious buy zone.
If markets hiccup this week or next then AMD first line of support is near still $88 per share. Even if that support fails there is a ton more of it at $8 lower. If the selling persists it would still have many layers to slow the sellers down. I want to caution about a slippery zone below $76 per share. If prices fall through that it would be a monumental gift to buy.
Investors Need to Use Modern Trading Tools
They don’t ring bells at tops and bottoms but they do give clues. Charts matter and so do the technicals. Machines are doing the trading and they don’t use emotions or opinions.
Prior failing points should be resistance zones, and we are coming up on one with AMD stock. If not long already I’d rather wait to see what happens there. Chase the breakout if it happens for a trade, or buy the dip if it fails. That is a strategy that has worked over and again with these momentum stocks.
What has also worked is using options. Selling puts below current levels has worked flawlessly for AMD stock. I can collect $3 per contract today for the opportunity of buying the stock at a 15% discount. This makes me long AMD with a nice cushion leaving room for error.

The company had a dominant market share in one of the biggest growth markets in the world. Yet somehow, Intel managed to bumble around and fall behind competitors in its technology.
Intel repeatedly delayed product rollouts and even potentially may have to rely on third-party chipmakers for the first time in the company’s history.
As a result of all those mistakes, Intel is hemorrhaging market share to Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and other competitors.
The 7 Best Marijuana Stocks on the Markets Right Now
Still, despite all of Intel’s missteps, INTC stock is trading at just 11.1 times forward earnings estimates. If the company can finally, finally get its act together in 2021, the upside for investors could be massive.
INTC Stock Value Case
Bank of America recently hosted an Intel bull-bear debate. Analyst Vivek Arya said the Intel bulls made several compelling arguments that Intel is a value at current levels.
First, Intel has the opportunity to overcome its 7 nanometer chip production issues by working with partners. Arya anticipates Intel will announce a production partnership with Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM) on its fourth-quarterearnings callin mid-January.
Intel could also choose to shift its focus away from 7nm and focus on next-generation 3nm chips to potentially launch in late 2022 or 2023. That strategy would have a severely negative impact on Intel’s near-term numbers. But it could potentially shift critical investor sentiment if the market could look past the company’s current problems.
INTC stock bulls also said a shift in management could gain back investor confidence. At the same time, the U.S. government could come in with some form of assistance given the critical nature of Intel’s business, particularly its manufacturing business.
Activist investor Dan Loeb also recently took a $1 billion stake in INTC stock. Loeb immediately called for the company to explore strategic alternatives, including potential divestments of non-core businesses.
Loeb’s guidance could help light a fire under Intel’s management and get investors excited about Intel again.
Value Trap Case
Of course, there is also a clear case to be made that INTC stock is simply a value trap. One of Intel’s biggest problems is that the semiconductor industry is all about timing.
Arya says any initiatives that would be big enough to turn the Intel aircraft carrier around and point it back in the right direction would be difficult and take a long time.
At the same time, competitors like AMD, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Marvell Technology (NASDAQ:MRVL) and others will continue to leave Intel behind.
Specifically, Arya says AMD is innovating faster and providing more features at lower price points than Intel. Perhaps most importantly, AMD is gaining credibility among Intel’s customers.
In addition, while Intel still has a dominant 90% share of the server CPU market, Arya says the markets in more advanced parallel processors, artificial intelligence accelerators, data processing units and other products are much more competitive.
Nvidia is the leading player in many of those next-generation markets.
Finally, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) have both started producing their own in-house ARM-based chips. Other Intel customers may soon follow suit, which creates yet another headwind for the company.
How to Play It
After hosting the bull-bear debate, Arya said he is personally in the INTC stock value trap camp.
“While strength in PCs/servers can buoy the stock in the [near-term], share loss will be more noticeable in 2H21 when comps likely get tougher,” Arya says.
Bank of America has an “underperform” rating and $45 price target for INTC stock.
I believe Intel may continue to underperform high-flyers like Nvidia and AMD. But I certainly wouldn’t sell or short the stock trading at 11.1 times forward earnings and 2.6 times sales.
Forget recovering lost market share or getting back to earnings and revenue growth. At that valuation, all Intel needs to do is stop the bleeding and it could easily double in a matter of months. General Electric (NYSE:GE) shares are up 77% in the past three months simply for stopping its bleeding.
In the meantime, INTC stock pays a solid 2.5% dividend to reward investors for their patience.
For now, I’d say Intel is a show-me stock. There’s no good reason to buy it today. But keep it on your watch list because Intel certainly won’t go down without a fight.

2021-01-11 00:00:00+00:00,Intel says production of new data center chips set to ramp up in first quarter,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intel-says-production-of-new-data-center-chips-set-to-ramp-up-in-first-quarter-2021-01-11,,,"By Stephen Nellis
Jan 11 (Reuters) - Intel Corp INTC.O said on Monday it would ramp up the production of a new data center chip in the first quarter and that a new generation of chipmaking technology will become a key part of its output this year.
Intel, the biggest maker of central processor chips for both PCs and for the data center servers that power the internet, has struggled with delays in ramping up its current 10-nanometer semiconductor manufacturing process and its next-generation 7-nanometer process. The delays have allowed rivals such as Advanced Micro Devices Inc AMD.O to gain market share.
Intel also faces an activist investor, Third Point LLC, which is pushing the company to re6evaluate its manufacturing strategy.
Intel plans to announce whether it plans to outsource production for some of its 2023 products on anearnings callon Jan. 21.
Meanwhile, Intel on Monday said its ""Ice Lake"" server chips made on its 10-nanometer process would start ramping up production this quarter, though it did not give specific volumes. It also said it would introduce 50 new processor designs for PCs this year, with 30 of those using the new 10-nanometer technology.
Overall, Intel said it expects the 10-nanometer chips to eclipse its older generation of 14-nanometer chips in terms of production volumes sometime this year.
The company on Monday also gave details about a chip that its Mobileye autonomous driving subsidiary is working on for a lidar sensor, a laser-based device that helps vehicles obtain a three-dimensional view of the road.
The lidar chip will be made in one of Intel's factories in New Mexico and will integrate both active and passive components onto a single chip, which was not possible outside chip factories, said Mobileye's vice president.
""That solves that dual contradiction of, 'I need a better sensor, but also need it to be way cheaper at the same time,'"" said Jack Weast, who is also a senior principal engineer at Intel.

Even when the market is moving lower, the Nasdaq has tended to find ways to bounce back. That's what's happened so far on Monday, as the index was down well over 1% early in the day but bounced back to just a 0.5% loss as of 12:45 p.m. EST.
There were plenty of stocks that doubled in 2020, especially within the tech industry. Companies that were able to meet the needs of businesses looking to build a digital presence and workers trying to find ways to get things done from home did exceedingly well. Yet even as some of those stocks have pulled back sharply to begin 2021, NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) are still headed higher. Let's look more closely to see why they're on the rise and what could lie ahead for the two chipmakers .
NVDA data by YCharts.
Chipping away
Both NVIDIA and AMD produced such healthy gains in 2020 because they played vital roles in supplying the tech industry with the innovative chips they needed in order to meet unprecedented demand. With the pace of digital transformation reaching a fevered pitch, both companies capitalized by coming out with products that the marketplace immediately jumped on.
NVIDIA had a number of elements push its stock higher. With so many enterprise customers building data centers to store all the information they collect, NVIDIA's A100 graphics processing units (GPUs) helped produce explosive growth in the company's data center segment. In addition, with so many people stuck at home during the COVID-19 pandemic, interest in video games soared. That in turn heightened demand for top NVIDIA gaming products like its RTX graphics processing unit line.

NVIDIA also turned to the mergers and acquisitions front to stoke its growth. The company announced the planned purchase of ARM Holdings. With a $40 billion price tag, the buy is a big commitment, but NVIDIA is convinced that it's a great way to grow its business and gain access to markets like mobile chips. It should also help boost NVIDIA's capacity to become a more self-sufficient company overall.
Meanwhile, AMD also found ways to stand out from the competition. The company's central processing units (CPUs) became exceedingly popular in the coronavirus crisis, helping it build up market share against longtime rival Intel (NASDAQ: INTC). New products like the Ryzen desktop processor played a big role in AMD's ascent, and the company also scored wins in the video gaming industry as its chips made their way into new video-game consoles like the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X.
At the same time, AMD has mergers and acquisitions (M&A) plans of its own. It's still looking to complete its announced deal to buy Xilinx (NASDAQ: XLNX). The move would help Advanced Micro Devices get a leg up in several areas of the semiconductor business, because Xilinx's field-programmable chip arrays allow for unprecedented customization and flexibility in meeting a wide variety of different user needs.
Can AMD and NVIDIA keep climbing?
Already this year, both AMD and NVIDIA are beating the Nasdaq and the broader stock market. That's largely because investors are excited about the prospects for the ongoing digital revolution, especially amid signs that a full recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic might take a lot longer than initially hoped.
NVIDIA and AMD have both kept up the pace in releasing cutting-edge products to give their customers what they want. That innovation isn't showing any signs of letting up soon. If they can keep wowing their clients, then both AMD and NVIDIA could easily keep climbing in 2021 and beyond.

The M1 chip: 10 years in the making
In early November, Apple released its new line of Macs to be powered by its proprietary M1 system-on-chip. It's the first line of Macs that will be powered by Apple's proprietary in-house chip design, as opposed to the Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) processors that they used in the past. According to Apple, the new M1 chip features, ""up to 3.5x faster CPU, up to 6x faster GPU, up to 15x faster machine learning (ML) capabilities, and battery life up to 2x longer than before."" Current specs show that the M1 battery lasts about twice as long, and recent benchmarks show it's much faster than the Intel's chips that powered last year's Macs. The M1 unified architecture allows the CPU, GPU, neural engine, controllers, and other parts of the processor system to access the same memory, so data does not need to be copied as it flows between each component. That increases speed and efficiency.
How did Apple achieve such a feat in unseating Intel, known as the gold standard for complex PC processors over the last two decades, and solely focused on leading chips? Part of the answer is that the M1 was 10 years in the making, and another is it had help from two key partners.
Apple's two dance partners
Because of Apple's scale and prestige, it has close partnerships throughout the chip industry, both on the design and foundry side. In this case, M1 came about through close coordination with private company ARM, which licenses its computing instruction architecture to third parties, and competes with the x86 architecture used by Intel and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD).
According to Twitter (NYSE: TWTR) posts from Shac Ron, a former Apple engineer who worked on the project, not only did Apple coordinate with ARM, it actually helped ARM build its 64-bit custom instruction set architecture (ISA) even before ARM was done building it. ""M1 performance is not so because of the ARM ISA, the ARM ISA is so because of Apple core performance plans a decade ago.""
Second, ever since Apple has been designing its own chips, it used foundry Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) as its partner for highly complex manufacturing. Two years ago, Taiwan Semi surpassed Intel in terms of its manufacturing capability. Producing leading-edge chips has become ever more difficult to achieve as chip densities increase and the distance between transistors gets smaller, and Taiwan Semi's diverse customer base has allowed it to get an edge on Intel's proprietary fabs.
The close partnership, with Apple as TSM's prime star customer, is how Apple became the first company to market with 5nm chips, which pack a whopping 16 billion transistors on each M1.
Qualcomm, you're next
Why is Apple designing its own Mac chips a really big deal -- perhaps even bigger than the new 5G iPhone? Because while branding, marketing, design, and the iOS operating system have afforded Apple somewhat of a moat against other handset and computer companies, as long as Apple uses the same semiconductors as other handset and computer assemblers, there's only so much differentiation Apple's products can really have. By disintermediating large and powerful processor companies, and putting in its own high-performance chip designs, Apple is digging a deeper and deeper economic moat against rivals. It's also a really fortunate bit of timing, as more and more people are working from home and need to upgrade their home computers -- a trend which should still remain elevated relative to history even after the pandemic ends.
As good as the new 5G iPhone is, it still uses a Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM) modem, and Apple has certainly tussled with Qualcomm over paying Qualcomm's exorbitant royalties in the recent past. However, after purchasing Intel's mobile modem unit in 2019, expect Apple to produce its own 5G modem within this decade.

With a pandemic, extreme political unrest, an economy still trying to find its way in the wake of it all, and the stock market near all-time highs, the reasons to invest may appear to be slim.
But there's always opportunity -- especially when negativity is running high -- to purchase shares of quality companies with great long-term prospects. Three Fool.com contributors think Veeva Systems (NYSE: VEEV), Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), and Naspers (OTC: NPSNY) are worth your while at the start of the new year.

Life sciences race to the ""digital transformation"" door
Nicholas Rossolillo (Veeva Systems): The future looks bright for life science stocks. For many, 2020 was a big year as pharmaceutical and biotech companies raced to find treatments and vaccines for COVID-19. The fight against the pandemic continues. And new research and development is being aimed at innovative healthcare treatments and methods of patient care. Collectively, trillions of dollars are being spent every year globally to improve health outcomes. From a business standpoint, there will be winners, but there will also be plenty of losers.
That's why Veeva Systems is one of my favorite stocks for the massive life sciences industries. Veeva is a way to participate in the growth of the whole universe rather than try to bet on which companies developing new treatments and health technologies will be the biggest winners. Specifically, Veeva provides cloud-based software and tools for pharmaceutical, biotech, and other health-related companies to manage their operations.
Besides participating in a general increase in life science research over time, Veeva is focused on helping these organizations make digital transformations -- updating tools and procedures to new digital standards. The software firm provides all sorts of functionality, ranging from clinical trial management to quality control to sensitive data management. It's constantly expanding its capabilities as well, recently adding new features to its far-reaching platform like virtual meetings and AI built into its customer relationship management product. Building on its early success as a software technologist partner for pharmaceutical and biotech companies, Veeva is expanding its platform to help consumer goods, chemical, and cosmetic companies as well.
This is a premium-priced stock at nearly 83 times trailing-12-month free cash flow (revenue minus cash operating expenses and capital expenditures), but for good reason. Veeva has consistently grown its sales at a double-digit percentage pace for years, a rate that accelerated in 2020 during the pandemic, and that shows no signs of slowing anytime soon as the need for new digital tools remains. Put simply, this is a best-in-class business that lies at the intersection of software and health.
This microchip giant is down but not out
Anders Bylund (Intel): Very few technology stocks strike me as great buys right now. The market as a whole looks overheated and many of my favorite stocks may be headed for a sharp correction in the not-too-distant future -- especially in the soaring tech sector. Semiconductor giant Intel is a rare exception to my unusually bearish analysis of the current market.
Intel shares are already trading at a 24% discount to their 52-week highs because Chipzilla has struggled to upgrade its manufacturing facilities to next-generation 7 nanometer technologies. This issue puts Intel on the back foot as many of its closest rivals are producing 7 nm chips with the help of third-party chip foundries led by Taiwan Semiconductor. Activist investor Daniel Loeb is asking Intel to consider breaking away from its time-honored commitment to running its own manufacturing facilities, suggesting that the company could spin its chip factories out as an independent company or even sell them to Taiwan Semi and friends.
Whether or not Intel adopts any of Loeb's ideas of radical change, Intel is well equipped for a return to full health. Nobody else in the semiconductor industry can match the company's massive research and development budget, which added up to $13.3 billion over the last four quarters. That's more than the R&D expenses of Advanced Micro Devices and Qualcomm combined. Innovation is the lifeblood of every technology company worth its salt, and Intel is taking its forward-looking development very seriously.
Intel's stock is priced for absolute disaster at just 10 times trailing earnings and 14 times free cash flows. That's an absolute steal if you believe that Intel is getting its derailed manufacturing upgrades back on track, as I do.
The company is due to report fourth-quarter results in a couple of weeks and I think it's wise to grab a few Intel shares on the cheap before that business update.
Get China's best company at half-price -- without investing in China
Billy Duberstein (Naspers): You don't often get to invest in a top-tier internet giant at half-price, especially in today's frothy tech market, but that's exactly what investors currently find in South African investment company Naspers.
Naspers used to be a South African media company, but has basically become an emerging-markets venture capital investor over the past 20 years. In late 2019, Naspers spun out its venture investments, which are basically all of its assets, into a separate company called Prosus (OTC: PROSY). As of last quarter, Naspers owned 72.66% of Prosus.
Prosus' main asset is the company's huge 31% stake in Chinese internet giant Tencent -- a stake that is now worth a whopping $226 billion. Not only that, but Prosus also has stakes in other large international food delivery, classifieds, and digital payments companies, which analysts estimate could be worth anther $30 billion.
What's remarkable is that Prosus' market cap is only worth about $173.3 billion today, or about a 32% discount to its asset value. Even more egregious? Naspers only trades at an $85.4 billion valuation, or another 32% below the value of its 72.7% stake in Prosus.
This all adds up to Naspers' market cap being about half its asset value. And while it's hard to say if and when that asset-to-value gap might close, Naspers/Prosus' management is taking advantage, recently announcing a $5 billion share repurchase program back in November.
Tencent has come under some pressure recently as rumors have swirled that the U.S. government may ban citizens from owning shares of some Chinese companies. For those wanting exposure to this best-in-class international growth stock, Naspers offers an indirect way to invest in Tencent without the direct Chinese risk, and at a massive discount, at that.

In addition to many companies in the space having highly scalable business models, technology also plays a decisive role in shaping nearly every other business sector.
We asked three Motley Fool contributors to profile their top tech pick for the new year. Read on to see why they think Glu Mobile (NASDAQ: GLUU), salesforce.com (NYSE: CRM), and Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM) are on track to be huge winners.
Image source: Getty Images.
Looking for huge gains? Start small
Keith Noonan (Glu Mobile): When it comes to naming top tech stocks for 2021, Glu Mobile admittedly might look like a bit of a strange pick. If you asked video game fans and industry watchers to name the most powerful and influential companies in the space, you probably wouldn't get many respondents offering up Glu Mobile.
Activision Blizzard, Tencent, and Take-Two Interactive are just a few of the many names in the industry that are substantially larger and more resource-rich than Glu. This is a small-cap company valued at roughly $1.6 billion, but there's also a lot to like about the stock at current prices.
For one, the valuation still looks quite reasonable in the context of strong performance and long-term growth tailwinds for the industry. The company's shares trade at about 17.5 times this year's expected earnings and just 2.5 times expected sales. Glu might not be able to match the titans of the industry with regards to development and marketing budgets, but it's got a solid collection of video game properties that are delivering reliable performance.
These franchises are putting up strong results thanks to ongoing content updates that are keeping players engaged, and management projects that its current lineup alone will be enough to drive bookings up between 8% and 10% next year. Glu is also set to release four new intellectual properties in 2021, which signals that the business could be heading into a dramatic new growth phase.
In my book, Glu Mobile stock currently epitomizes the concept of ""growth at a reasonable price."" Its core franchises are putting up solid performance, major new releases are on the way, and the company will likely make acquisition moves in the near future to accelerate its growth. It's also experimenting with integrating real-world e-commerce stores into its titles. The stock still looks cheaply valued, and success for even a small number of its growth bets could send this small cap soaring.
The cloud software titan
Joe Tenebruso (Salesforce): Successful tech investing often comes down to identifying powerful long-term trends. Cloud computing, big data, and remote work are three such megatrends -- and at their intersection lies Salesforce.
Salesforce is the global leader in cloud-based customer relationship software. It dominates the industry, with a market share that's larger than its four closest competitors combined.
Acquisitions have helped Salesforce enter new markets. Thanks in part to its purchases of MuleSoft and Tableau, Salesforce is now a leader in data integration and visualization. By helping its customers better aggregate, analyze, and understand their data, the cloud leader has ingrained itself in its customers' operations.
Today, Salesforce has its sights set on the fast-growing enterprise communications market. In December, it reached a deal to acquire Slack Technologies (NYSE: WORK). Salesforce intends to combine Slack's workplace messaging platform with its cloud software to ""transform the way everyone works in the all-digital, work-from-anywhere world,"" according to CEO Marc Benioff.
Although acquisitions can be risky, Benioff and his team have a proven track of success. They've managed to integrate past acquisitions and create a whole that's far greater than the sum of its parts. Salesforce's strong financial results are a testament to its operational excellence. The cloud titan's revenue climbed 20% year over year to $5.4 billion in the third quarter, while its operating cash flow rose 14% to $339 million.
With the cloud computing, big data, and remote work trends still in their early stages, investors can expect much more growth ahead for Salesforce in 2021 and beyond.
A strong connection to 5G profits
Will Healy (Qualcomm): Thanks to 5G, investors can connect with this chip stock on a new level. Since Apple now sells 5G-compatible devices, the upgrade cycle has begun in earnest. With 5G offering speeds exponentially higher than that of 4G, most users will likely upgrade at some point.
Qualcomm benefits because it is the only maker of a critical 5G chipset. This should remain true for at least the foreseeable future. Last year, Qualcomm persuaded a court to overturn a ruling that Qualcomm was a monopoly.
Apple also dropped its lawsuits against Qualcomm in 2019. However, it did buy Intel's smartphone chipset business, presumably to someday offer a competing product.
One can understand why Apple wants a piece of this market. This business is so large that Grand View Research forecasts a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 63% through 2027.
These increases have already begun to materialize. In its most recent quarter, adjusted revenue rose by 35% from the same quarter last year. Adjusted earnings per share surged by 86% over the same period.
Moreover, despite recent growth in Qualcomm stock, investors may not yet appreciate the value proposition. Even with the move higher, Qualcomm's forward P/E ratio stands at about 21. This is extremely cheap, especially considering the potential growth and Qualcomm's market position.
Finally, as CEO Steven Mollenkopf retires, Qualcomm insider Cristiano Amon will take over the position. Amon spearheaded Qualcomm's 5G strategy. As he takes the helm, Amon could bring an added 5G focus that should help take Qualcomm higher in 2021 and beyond.

2021-01-09 00:00:00+00:00,Is NXP Semiconductors Stock a Buy?,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/is-nxp-semiconductors-stock-a-buy-2021-01-09,,,"Life has been challenging for many semiconductor stocks over the last few years. Ongoing effects from the trade war between the U.S. and China paired with the pandemic have upset the applecart for many firms. NXP Semiconductor (NASDAQ: NXPI) is no exception. The chipmaker's auto and smartphone markets were hit hard by the pandemic in 2020, and the stock's 40% return over the last trailing-three-year stretch has underperformed the 115% return of the semiconductor industry overall, as measured by the iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SOXX).
However, while it may not be the best growth stock in the chip universe, NXP does pay a small dividend -- and could be a solid bet in 2021 as the economy gradually recovers from COVID-19.
A beatdown from lower smartphone and auto sales
NXP is best known for making connectivity chips for the automotive industry, industrial applications (factory equipment and healthcare devices), and mobile communications (smartphones and communication network infrastructure). The auto and smartphone segments make up the lion's share of sales, and autos in particular are a promising long-term market. Besides various connectivity solutions, NXP designs advanced driver-assist systems (ADAS) and battery management devices for electric vehicles.
Image source: Getty Images.
However, these two primary segments were struggling in 2020. Stuck at home, consumer spending on vehicles and smartphones took a big plunge last spring and dragged NXP down too. As the company had yet to rally from the effects of the U.S.-China trade war in 2018 and 2019, COVID-19 was salt on an already open wound.

*Free cash flow = revenue minus cash operating expenses and capital expenditures. Data source: NXP Semiconductor.
However, NXP's sales have begun to rally as manufacturing activity in its two most prominent end markets fires up again. It still has a ways to go before it gets back to its revenue record highs -- and even further to go to reach free cash flow records -- but the company nonetheless has regained positive traction. And for a semiconductor company that is reliant on cyclical manufacturing trends, this means there could be plenty of upside left. NXP currently trades for 28 times trailing 12-month free cash flow, a reasonable valuation if its profit margins improve along with sales in the year ahead.
An alternative bet on the auto industry
There's reason to believe NXP will in fact return to growth mode. For one thing, management forecasted as much for the 2020 fourth quarter. At the midpoint of guidance, revenue is expected to increase 8% from Q3 to $2.45 billion, and adjusted operating profit margin should be in the 29%-to-30% ballpark (compared to just 25.8% in Q3).
NXP also doesn't have the baggage some of its peers do. Like Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), NXP handles both the design and the manufacture of chips in-house -- unlike many chip companies these days, which are ""fabless"" and completely outsource manufacturing to companies like Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE: TSM) or GlobalFoundries. In fact, for some of its more advanced fabrication needs, NXP has a partnership with Taiwan Semiconductor, the technological leader in chipmaking and the largest chip manufacturer in the world. NXP is thus on solid footing when it comes to supplying hardware for its customers -- unlike Intel, whose recent production troubles have caused it to fall behind with its chipmaking capabilities.
This could be a key advantage for NXP as a new era dawns for autos and mobility. Since this semiconductor company is a leader in providing next-gen tech for vehicles spanning connectivity, autonomous capabilities, and vehicle electrification, NXP could be a great alternative bet on a rebounding auto industry -- not to mention a value play on emerging auto tech. The same goes for mobile technology like 5G networks. NXP has a hand in the upcoming 5G smartphone upgrade cycle, as well as in the construction of 5G networks themselves.
Of course, the numbers demonstrate this is far from the fastest-growing semiconductor company. I expect NXP Semiconductor's stock will likely underperform the likes of NVIDIA over the course of the long-term. But NXP does pay a dividend -- it currently only yields 0.9% a year, but don't knock low-yielding payouts that have room to increase over time. For investors looking for a way to play the auto tech movement, don't write off NXP Semiconductors.

2021-01-08 00:00:00+00:00,Why Intel Shares Fell 16.8% in 2020,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-intel-shares-fell-16.8-in-2020-2021-01-08,,,"What happened
Shares of Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) fell 16.8% last year, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. The semiconductor giant faced the same difficult market conditions as everyone else, plus the additional burden of a lagging upgrade to next-generation manufacturing technologies.
So what
Intel owns and operates its manufacturing lines. That's usually a competitive advantage since Intel tends to run at the bleeding edge of advanced manufacturing processes. Having a better process than the competition lets the company produce more chips from a single silicon wafer, which reduces costs and increases the finished product's performance.
The upgrade to 7-nanometer manufacturing lines ran into technical difficulties last year, however, leaving Intel with the rare disadvantage of trailing behind the leading third-party chip foundries, where most of the semiconductor industry has its blueprints turned into physical products.
Disappointing updates on the slow upgrades triggered the worst single-day drops of the year, led by a 16% plunge on July 24 and an 11% crash on Oct. 23.
The room where it happens: a ""clean room"" where chips are made. Image source: Getty Images.
Now what
I fully expect Intel to bounce back from this temporary setback because the company is armed with an industry-leading research & development department and some of the deepest pockets in Silicon Valley.
The market is shifting, and it's fair to say that smaller rivals are walking away with slices of Intel's market share in PC processors and maybe even server chips. At the same time, Intel is making up for lost ground by attacking new target markets such as automotive computing and custom chips for artificial intelligence systems.
You can grab an Intel share for the bargain-bin valuation of 10.2 times trailing earnings, 10.1 times free cash flows, and 2.6 times sales. I'm very comfortable with the idea of buying Intel at these ultra-cheap prices.

The 100% return on Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) in 2020 is nothing short of breathtaking. The semiconductor company beat the Nasdaq’s nearly 50% return in that time. In the last half of the year, though, AMD stock is appearing to struggle.

AMD found support in the $75 – $80 range, at around its 50-day moving average. Conversely, the stock broke out in the last month to the $90 – $97.98 range.
At this price, the stock is valued at a still-expensive forward price-to-earnings ratio of 50 times. Its competitor, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) failed to refresh its lineup of next-generation computer chips in the last year.
Might investors continue to expect Intel to stumble on the personal computer and server markets?
Intel Shake-Out Will Move AMD Stock
Hedge Fund activist Dan Loeb send a letter to Intel, which Reuters obtained. He urged the company to explore strategic alternatives. Having built a nearly $1 billion holding in Intel shares, Loeb called for the company to outsource more of its manufacturing capacity. It also wanted it to slim down. For example, that would put Intel’s Altera acquisition for $16.7 billion on the selling block.
10 of 2020's Most Fascinating SPAC Stocks
Divesting businesses not related to the PC CPU and data center market would put pressure on AMD. The company is enjoying market share growth in the server market. Thanks to its EPYC server product, customers benefit from higher performance at lower costs.
By comparison, Intel relied too long on the Xeon processor. Its latest processor is the E7-8890 v4. This has a 60MB cache, 24 cores, 48 threads, and a 3.40 GHz maximum turbo frequency.
AMD EPYC has a security feature called Infinity Guard. Its 7002 series outperforms Intel’s chip on nearly every benchmark, as shown here.
In the PC market, Intel’s integrated graphics offered with its CPU gives it an edge on convenience and pricing. Customers could opt from AMD’s 2400G or 3400G. But since the other AMD chips do not have integrated graphics, corporations may still prefer Intel’s desktop CPUs.
AMD for Gaming
Hardware and game review sites favor AMD’s Ryzen CPU. For example, PC Gamer rated Ryzen 9 5900X as the best CPU for gaming right now. It also rated Ryzen 5 5600X and Ryzen 7 5800X in the second and fourth rank, respectively.
In the notebook space, PC makers started to list AMD-powered solutions on the main page.
On Lenovo’s (OTCMKTS:LNVGY) website, two of the ThinkBooks, powered by the AMD’s Ryzen 4000 series, are listed at the top.
As more PC brands, including Dell (NYSE:DELL) and Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ), embrace AMD, revenue will continue to explode higher.
Risks to AMD

Rumors that Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is working on in-house processors for its servers and PC are a threat to AMD. That would bring another goliath to the chip market. This would slow AMD’s market share growth and pressure its profit margins.
Technology from Arm Ltd. is proven to offer excellent performance and power-saving features. This chip would suit Microsoft’s hot-growing Surface PCs. The move would follow Apple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) decision to power its computers with an in-house M1 chip.
For now, Wall Street analysts are not concerned about Microsoft or Apple going on their own. The average price target is around $95.00, and 13 of the 20 analysts rate AMD stock as a “buy.”
The ratings as shown above suggest that investors need not worry about AMD’s prospects. The stock has a perfect 100/100 growth rating. The company is efficiently run and has a healthy balance sheet, as the financial strength of 76/100 indicates. Still, the 37/100 value score is a data point to watch out for.
Your Takeaway
AMD will likely shine again this year. Its server and desktop business is thriving. The stay-at-home and work-from-home trends show no sign of abating.
A Covid-19 vaccine will encourage workers to return to work physically. That is still many months away. Until then, PC sales will increase throughout this year and next.
AMD is a stock to buy.

Intel is due to open for trade Jan. 6 at about $51 per share. That’s carries a market capitalization of $209.4 billion on expected 2020 sales of $78 billion. This is despite a 33-cent per share dividend yielding 2.66%, one that might be boosted soon.
Activist investor Dan Loeb is now saying what I did, that Intel should go “fabless” and spin-out its fabrication plants to add focus and value.
His letter to the board called it an issue of national security.
Intel Stock and the Chipmaker’s Troubled Times
Intel’s problems have been building for over two decades, ever since the late co-founder Andy Grove gave up the CEO chair in 1998. Grove wrote a book called Only the Paranoid Survive. His successors rested on the great man’s laurels.
Intel was late to move to low-power chips. It was late in seeing the shift to mobile, and to OEM dominance of that channel. Over the next decade it failed in countless other areas. It has lost its lead in microprocessors to Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and its lead in chip fabrication to Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM). It has ceded innovation to Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA).
7 Hot Stocks to Buy Now Before They Take Off
Under former CEO Brian Krzanich, top women managers fled or were pushed out. When Krzanich himself was forced to resign in a sex scandal, Intel tried for a year to recruit a replacement. It finally settled on its chief financial officer, Robert Swan.
Swan has run Intel by the numbers. The company delivered $25 billion of operating cash flow for the first three quarters of 2020. It had $18 billion of cash and securities on the books at the end of September, against $36 billion of debt. The dividend costs $5.4 billion a year and the company’s buying back $10 billion in stock.
But value is out of style, especially in tech. Over the last year, shares are down nearly 16%. While the average S&P 500 index stock is up 46% over the last two years — Intel is up just 7.2%.
Make Intel Great Again
Intel’s fate is similar to that of other tech giants like Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) and IBM (NYSE:IBM), which investors have shunned despite juicy dividends. Tech investors want growth. Intel shares remain 24% below where they were in August 2000, at the peak of the dot-com boom.
As Techopedia writer Kishore Jethanandani wrote recently, Intel is still focused on microlithography, burning smaller-and-smaller lines onto silicon. Meanwhile the industry has moved on to nanotechnology, with new materials like graphene and Indo Gallium Zinc Oxide (IGZO) changing chips from components into systems. The new techniques are additive, not subtractive. The result is that Intel has fallen behind in the very areas it pioneered.
The Bottom Line
Intel still has the cash and the equity needed to get back in the game, but it needs to move quickly.
Separating the fabrication plants from the design process may no longer be enough to create big returns.
Third Point’s Loeb is right: Intel’s problems are a national security issue. “America’s access to leading-edge semiconductor supply will erode, forcing the U.S. to rely more heavily on a geopolitically unstable East Asia,” he wrote.
That’s why now may be a good time to pick up some Intel stock. Action is required, and action will come. Pressure will be applied from both Wall Street and Washington for Intel to get back in the game.
Until it does you get a nice dividend. Buy low. Sell high.

HONG KONG (Reuters Breakingviews) - Intel's troubles today could be Samsung's tomorrow. The South Korean giant is ending 2020 on a strong note, thanks largely to its dominance in memory chips. Its U.S. peer, by contrast, has fallen behind and faces calls from a pushy investor to break up. A prolonged leadership vacuum at Samsung threatens a similar gradual decline.
    The $511 billion technology conglomerate expects operating profit in the three months to December will be $8.2 billion, slightly below estimates collected in a Refinitiv poll. Detailed results are due later in the month, but an appreciating won against the dollar is probably to blame. Smartphone sales also may have disappointed amid competition from Apple's iPhone 12. Even so, prices for memory chips, Samsung's main profit driver, are showing signs of a recovery, helped by industry-wide supply cuts and improving server demand. After rallying by some 50% over the past six months, the company’s shares now trade at a record high on back of an anticipated recovery.
    This upbeat outlook, however, is a far cry from Intel's. For decades, the chipmaker was at the forefront of churning out microprocessors that powered PCs and laptops before squandering its technological and manufacturing edge in mobile. Now activist hedge fund Third Point is pushing for a shakeup at the $214 billion company, warning that Intel not only ""lost its pole position"" in chipmaking to Samsung and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, but has allowed smaller and nimbler outfits such as Advanced Micro Devices and Nvidia to take market share and dominate new areas.
Samsung's de facto leader, Jay Y. Lee, would be wise take note. The third-generation heir has been embroiled in a corruption scandal since 2017 and faces a nine-year prison term for bribery and other charges, with a court set to rule later this month. While he has largely stepped back from day-to-day management, he oversees the overall strategic direction. The company has stayed on the side-lines in autonomous driving and artificial intelligence, even as compatriot Hyundai Motor steps up acquisitions and investments in such fields. The danger for Samsung is that there’s now some Intel inside.

2021-01-07 00:00:00+00:00,February 26th Options Now Available For Intel (INTC),INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/february-26th-options-now-available-for-intel-intc-2021-01-07,,,"Investors in Intel Corp (Symbol: INTC) saw new options become available today, for the February 26th expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the INTC options chain for the new February 26th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $51.50 strike price has a current bid of $2.55. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $51.50, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $48.95 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of INTC, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $52.35/share today.
Because the $51.50 strike represents an approximate 2% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 100%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 4.95% return on the cash commitment, or 36.15% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Intel Corp, and highlighting in green where the $51.50 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $53.00 strike price has a current bid of $2.33. If an investor was to purchase shares of INTC stock at the current price level of $52.35/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $53.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 5.69% if the stock gets called away at the February 26th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if INTC shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Intel Corp, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing INTC's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $53.00 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $53.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 4.45% boost of extra return to the investor, or 32.49% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.
Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $52.35) to be 54%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

When gold was discovered at Sutter’s Mill in the 1850s, thousands upon thousands of people rushed to California hoping to strike it rich.
Source: Shutterstock
Some got lucky and did. Most did not.
A few very smart folks made their fortunes another way — by selling basic goods to the miners.
You may not have heard of Sam Brannan, but he was the first millionaire of the California Gold Rush. He made his fortune selling pots, pans, shovels, and picks to all the gold hunters.
But you probably have heard of Levi Strauss, or at least Levi’s jeans. He started producing a new kind of durable pants for the miners. They became a huge hit and Strauss got rich. And as you know, his company’s blue jeans and now other products are still successful nearly 170 years later.
This “picks and shovels” strategy is a brilliant business model … and a brilliant investing strategy.
It may have originated long before the technologies driving our world today, but you can still get rich using it today …
One of the great things about investing in massive transformational technologies is that there are a few ways you can do it.
One is the direct route, which would be like going for the gold.
Another is to invest in related companies that will profit from the growing value of an industry or product.
And a third is to invest in ancillary plays — the good old picks and shovels strategy. I’ve had a lot of success investing this way through the years, and I’m not stopping now.
The picks and shovels strategy can even be applied to something as modern as bitcoin, cryptocurrencies, and the underlying blockchain technology that they are built on. In fact, I just recommended two blockchain-related stocks in the new Investment Opportunities issue that was just released.
Bitcoin was the best performing asset class of 2020 … and 2019. The world’s largest cryptocurrency returned 308% in just 12 months, crushing both the S&P 500 and gold.
Bitcoin’s breakout last year was impressive, but what has taken place in just the first week of 2021 is staggering. The cryptocurrency is on absolute fire. In just the last seven days, bitcoin climbed as much as 38% to hit $40K. Less than a month ago, everybody was all abuzz as it rallied through $20,000 for the first time.
The excitement goes beyond bitcoin. Ethereum, the world’s second largest cryptocurrency and the largest altcoin, is up over 70% in the last week and above $1,000 for the first time in years. And the value of the entire crypto industry surpassed $1 trillion today for the first time ever.
Blockchain is going to be huge because it will touch virtually every industry on Earth. I’m talking about your financial and banking information… your personal healthcare information … proprietary business information … contracts … tax information … credit card payments … real estate transactions … energy … and on and on.
It is already being used in more and more places all the time, and this massive disruption creates great opportunities for us as investors.
I love investing in bitcoin and altcoins, but it’s also smart to invest in related stocks. These are the picks and shovels of the digital gold rush.
For example, as the world moves further into the Roaring 2020s, industries will be forced to adopt blockchain technology or be left behind. This will require computing power comparable to the PC boom from the 1980s into the 2000s. Chipmakers like Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) were some of the biggest winners of that technology bull market. Its stock soared more than 3,700% in the 1990s.
We are now at that same point in the next technology boom a quarter of a century later. Semiconductor companies and chipmakers that concentrate on blockchain will be some of the biggest winners of the Roaring 2020s. I just recommended one of these companies in the new Investment Opportunities issue, a stock that I believe has 10X potential in the next decade.
The other company I recommended not only stands to benefit from the blockchain boom, it’s also the hottest kind of investment on Wall Street right now — the SPAC, or Special Purpose Acquisition Company. This company went public last fall via the SPAC route, and it’s the first of its kind to list on the Nasdaq.
It’s a unique find. I think it may be the only opportunity for individuals to invest in the entire ecosystem of cryptocurrencies and the blockchain. And it won’t make a difference whether bitcoin, Ethereum, or smaller altcoins are the big winners during the Roaring 2020s. As long as cryptocurrencies and blockchain continue their high growth trajectory — and I can’t see how they won’t — the odds of this company growing significantly are very high.
Looking ahead at what’s coming, you should think about your exposure to blockchain-related investments. Some are saying it’s going to be bigger than the internet.
Whether that’s true or not, it’s going to be very big. And the good news is, there are multiple ways to grow your wealth.

BOSTON, Jan 6 (Reuters) - Some investors including William Ackman and Glenn Welling, who push corporations to perform better, posted record-breaking returns in 2020 when activist investors generally backed off demands during a year marked by wild and unexpected business conditions.
Ackman's publicly traded Pershing Square Holdings PSH.AS fund rose 70.2%, marking the best-ever return at his 16-year-old firm Pershing Square Capital Management and one of the best in the hedge fund industry. In 2019, the fund rose 58%, also a record.
Welling's Engaged Capital, founded in 2012 and known for pushing companies like Medifast Inc MED.N and Hain Celestial Group Inc HAIN.O to make changes, returned 51%. That tops the firm's previous record return set in 2019 with a 34% gain.
And Andrew Left, who has targeted companies he thinks are over-valued through his work at Citron Research, told investors that his hedge fund returned 155% in 2020, after gaining 43% in 2019, the fund's first year in business.
The gains reflect a late-year rebound among activists - fueled partly by strong stock market gains - with the average fund up 6.7% in the first 11 months of 2020 after a 27% drop in the first quarter, Hedge Fund Research data shows. Activist campaigns were down 20% in 2020 from the previous year, Lazard data shows.
At Third Point, where Daniel Loeb unveiled a late-year campaign at Intel Corp INTC.O, the Offshore Fund finished up 20.6%, its best return since 2013 when it gained 26%. That came after Loeb repositioned the portfolio and personnel in the wake of a 16% loss in the first quarter.
Blackwells Capital, currently bidding for Monmouth Real Estate Investment Corp MNR.N, gained 32% last year, their first time reporting their activist fund returns.
Falcon Edge Capital, a steady investor in blank check companies like the ones Ackman and Loeb's firms have created, gained 43% last year.
Representatives for the funds declined to comment.

With successful chip products delivered to data centers and the gaming industry, the last few years have been great for AMD stock.

What’s more, this company has a notable and competitive product pipeline that has the potential to take on a large market share. Advanced Micro Devices has turned out to be a winner, even in a pandemic. That’s a notable feat.
But what should really interest you about this pick? Well, the revenue and sales numbers speak for themselves. 
AMD Stock and Impressive Product Releases 
The first thing you should consider when it comes to AMD stock is the company’s wide range of products. Fundamentally, it is the products and their performance that matter. So, let’s take a look at the line up for 2021 and 2022.
First, AMD’s Ryzen processor is strong and consistently drives revenue. It’s even described by some as the “fastest mainstream-platform gaming CPU” out there. Advanced Micro Devices reported a high third-quarter revenue partly driven by a rise in Ryzen sales. So, the product makes AMD a leader in desktop processors, giving it a substantial edge in the market. 
8 Battery Stocks to Buy for Potentially Safer EV Exposure
In fact, the Ryzen 5000 series has made incredibly strong performance gains, with a 19% “improvement in instructions per clock (IPC).” Additionally, PCWorld even agrees that “there is a clear case for AMD’s claims that the Zen 3-based Ryzen chips are the ‘best gaming CPUs.'” All in all, AMD was able to tout strong performance improvements in gaming, video editing and computer-aided design with the new chips. And on top of that, the company has made significant impact with its “ultrathin” 4000 series, the Radeon RX 6000 series and more.
As a result, AMD’s biggest rival — Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) — is losing hold of the market due to outmatched performance and an inability to capitalize on semiconductor demand. It’s even lost clients like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Meanwhile, in the desktop and PC market, AMD has a significant share of roughly 20% and growing. Plus, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) recently asked AMD to help increase production to meet the demand for its latest Xbox consoles. Because of this, management expects revenue to be even better for AMD in Q4.
Finally, Advanced Micro Devices recently made a deal to acquire Xilinx (NASDAQ: XLNX), a leader in the high-performance computing industry. This acquisition has boosted AMD stock and will open up new markets, such as defense and aerospace.
Strong Financials Are Driving Stock Performance
Of course, these noteworthy increases in product performance have bolstered the company’s financials. Unsurprisingly, AMD had great third-quarter results.
In Q3, revenues hit $2.8 billion, a 56% year-over-year (YOY) increase. Additionally, operating income was $449 million (up 141% YOY from $186 million) and net income was $390 million (up 225% YOY from $120 million). Finally, diluted earnings per share (EPS) went up from 11 cents to 32 cents. Cash and cash equivalents stood at $1.77 billion for the quarter. 
Needless to say, AMD is doing well. But it’s not stopping there. For Q4, the company expects a 41% increase on revenues of $3 billion and a 41% YOY increase for 2020 overall. That, of course, will lead to a rapid rise in EPS. Plus, the company has a substantial free cash flow margin which means significant investment in capital and higher rewards for shareholders.
So, the stock certainly has long-term potential. AMD has an outstanding slate of new products ready to release and its high performance is expected to continue well into 2021 and 2022. Based on that, shares could easily cross $100 in the coming year.
Bottom line? If you own AMD stock, hold your horses and wait for the right time to book profit.

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.

Retail traders are already turning their attention to the best investments to start 2021. Undoubtedly, it’s a daunting task. The past year was an unprecedented one in every sense of the word.
Despite the novel coronavirus pandemic, stock markets had a respectable 2020. In fact, Covid-19 has served as a tailwind for several sectors like entertainment, pharmaceutical and medical devices, logistics, and biotech.
Electric vehicle (EV) stocks and high-risk SPAC plays became the flavor of the season, as investors turned to nontraditional areas to park their capital. All of this led to a stock market rally that defied expectations.
While the economy is still way off pre-pandemic strength, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 started and ended this unprecedented year at all-time highs. On the final trading day of the year, the Dow closed 0.7%, or 197 points, higher, and the broader S&P 500 jumped 0.6%. Although not every company and sector is doing well. That’s why you need a solid strategy to pick the best investments to start 2021.
This list provides you with five names with a ten-year record of profitability and an ROE of more than 15%. The five-year revenue growth rate (per share) is above 5%. None of the constituents has an operating margin percentage of less than 20. All are listed on major U.S. exchanges. They have a 5-year revenue growth rate (per share) and a 5-year EPS growth rate of over 5% and 10%, respectively.
8 Battery Stocks to Buy for Potentially Safer EV Exposure
Without further ado, here are the best investments to start 2021:
Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG,NASDAQ:GOOGL)
Intel (NASDAQ:INTC)
NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA)
Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN)
NetEase (NASDAQ:NTES)
Best Investments to Start 2021: Alphabet (GOOG,GOOGL)
We start this list with a tech bellwether. Google’s parent company became the third tech company to reach a $1 trillion market capitalization in 2020. Relative to the S&P 500 baseline, GOOGL has outperformed the S&P 500 by 21.2% in the past five years. One would think that there is little upside left to exploit. But this is Google we are talking about.
As a valued member of the FAANG stocks — the five most popular and best-performing American technology companies: Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Alphabet, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) — shares of the tech juggernaut are the safest bet in a volatile market.
Alphabet’s share-price target was raised to $2,000 from $1,725 by Colin Sebastian, an analyst at Robert W. Baird & Co., citing “strong” e-commerce trends through much of the holiday shopping season and digital-advertising visibility improving throughout 2021. That isn’t far from the 12-month consensus price target of $1,920 per share. The bull case estimate is $2,250 a pop.
Out of the last 12 quarters, the company has beat analyst estimates nine times. This is despite Wall Street setting stiff targets. It’s a testament to Google’s consistent performance. Despite shares trading at 30.58 times forward price-to-earnings, GOOGL stock is a worthwhile investment considering its monopolistic position in search.
Alphabet has never paid out any cash distribution to shareholders. However, share repurchases are a large part of the company’s strategy. Google allocated $18 billion to buying back its shares over 2019. Despite the pandemic, Alphabet’s board authorized the company to repurchase up to $28 billion of its Class C shares in its second quarter.
I recommend reading Dana Blankenhorn’s article on Google. It will help you develop a well-rounded understanding of where the company is at the moment. He raises pertinent points regarding complacency in the company’s management and how it can affect its long term future. Despite the positives associated with the tech giant, one should keep these factors in mind when investing in the stock.
Intel (INTC)

Intel surged as much as 8% on Tuesday, Dec. 29, 2020, after the chipmaker received a letter from the activist hedge fund, Third Point urged it to explore strategic alternatives. It halted a period of substantial decline for the American multinational semiconductor company, which has been losing market share to Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD).
Third Point, run by billionaire investor Daniel Loeb, has a $1 billion stake in Intel. According to Loeb, Intel has lost its pole position in microprocessor manufacturing to Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM) and Samsung (OTCMKTS:SSNLF). Customers like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) are looking to manufacture chips in-house or outsource to East Asia.
These are legitimate concerns. And it makes sense the markets are reflecting this sentiment. But investors shouldn’t forget Intel is a consistent performer with a powerful brand name. Out of the last 12 quarters, it has reported analyst beats 11 times. Most recently, Intel’s third-quarter revenue beat estimates, its profit was in-line with projections, and it boosted its full-year guidance. It has an ROE of 29.4% and a dividend yield of 2.65%. The company has increased its dividend for six consecutive years.
8 Cheap Stocks to Snap Up for the New Year
Despite all this, INTC stock is trading at 11 times forward P/E. Not bad, considering its track record. There are concerns regarding the company’s long-term competitive position in CPUs and sluggish data center growth. But that shouldn’t deter you from investing in INTC stock.
NVIDIA (NVDA)

Nvidia is the leading designer of graphics processing units used in various end markets, including high-end PCs for gaming, data centers, and automotive infotainment systems. The multinational originally focused on traditional PC graphics applications such as gaming. However, it’s now working on more complex and favorable opportunities, including artificial intelligence and autonomous driving.
The company reported a record $4.73 billion in revenue in the third quarter, up 57% year-on-year, beating analyst estimates by $303.87 million. Breaking down the total sales figure, game revenue came in at $2.27 billion, up 37% from a year earlier. Datacenter revenue of $1.90 billion represents 162% year-over-year growth. EPS came in at $2.41 per share, a 25.5% beat over the analyst estimate of $1.92 per share. It continues the company’s consistent record of beating analyst estimates. Out of the last 12 quarters, NVIDIA delivered earnings beats 11 times.
Due to these reasons and more, NVDA stock gained 122.3% in the last one year. Consensus estimates are for shares to climb 13.6% in the next 12 months. The bear case estimate is for shares to rise as high as $700 a pop. Sales are estimated to jump 20.5% in the next year. Nvidia’s long-awaited GeForce RTX 2070 Super and 2080 Super GPUs are doing very well. Its also working on even more Ampere-based graphics cards to join the growing GeForce RTX 30 series.
The dividend yield of 0.1% may seem insignificant. But NVDA stock has been a blockbuster run over the last few years. And relative to the S&P 500 baseline, it has outperformed the S&P 500 by 1397.8% in the past five years. That has pushed the yield down, despite NVIDIA maintaining a healthy payout throughout the same period.
The only thing going against NVDA stock is its premium valuation. Shares are trading at 44.6 times forward P/E. Its the highest multiple in its peer group, which includes Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT), Lam Research (NASDAQ:LRCX), AMD, and ASML Holding. Then again, it has one of the best track records for consistent growth and profitability. Plus, it’s investing heavily in high growth areas like AI and autonomous driving. That shall yield massive dividends moving forward.
Texas Instruments (TXN)

The chances are that if you have ever owned scientific, graphing, and financial calculators, you have heard of Texas Instruments. However, the company is much more than just a calculator manufacturer. Dallas-based Texas Instruments generates approximately 95% of its revenue from semiconductors and the remainder from its well-known calculators.
It’s the world’s largest maker of analog chips and a leading provider of digital signal processors. TXN stock gained 31.7% last year. Very impressive, considering the challenging environment due to Covid-19. The positive momentum is largely down to its consistent performance. Over the last 12 quarters, it beat analyst estimates 11 times.
TXN posted $1.45 a share on revenue of $3.82 billion in Q3. The markets were expecting earnings of $1.28 a share, on sales of $3.4 billion. Revenue increased by 18% sequentially, “with notable strength from the rebound of automotive demand and growing demand from personal electronics,” Rich Templeton, TI’s chairman, president, and CEO, said.
Like the other companies on the list, Texas Instruments has a ten-year record of profitability. Its operating margin of 40.4% stands head and shoulders above anyone in its peer group. TXN revenues rose 10% to $14.4 billion in 2019 from $13 billion in 2015. Over the same period, EPS grew 90% from $2.86 to $5.33. That kind of conversion is hard to find. It boasts an ROE of 59.9% and a dividend yield of 2.5%. It has 10 plus years of consecutive dividend growth, making it one of the best investments to start 2021.
7 Media Stocks That Could Light Up Your Gray Winter
TXN stock trades at 31.6 times forward P/E. It’s the cheapest stock in its peer group, excluding Lam Research, which trades at 28 times.
NetEase (NTES)

NetEase is the second-largest mobile gaming company in the world. The Guangzhou, China-based Internet technology company develops and operates online PC and mobile games. Founded in 1997, the company generated 78% of its revenue from online game services in 2019. It licenses games from developers such as Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI) and Microsoft, but 90% of the gaming revenue comes from the self-licensed games.
NetEase is aggressively expanding into new areas, hoping to unseat Tencent Music (NYSE:TME) in the music streaming market. It offers music streaming through NetEase Cloud Music, e-commerce through Yanxuan, internet media, and e-mail services. Online education is another area in which the company is expanding. The market of online education in China will be an opportunity of US$100 billion by 2026. The pandemic will only exacerbate the shift towards it. NetEase wants to capture a significant chunk of the market with its Youdao (NYSE:DAO) platform and the Youdao Dictionary brand.
Due to its asset-light business model, the company has an operating margin of 20.78%. Like the others on this list of best investments to start 2021, it has ten years of profitability behind it, with an enviable ROE of 25.77%. Five-year revenue and EPS growth stand at 33.1% and 15.6%, respectively. The annual dividend yield of 1% isn’t that attractive. But the company has a lot of varied investments that require substantial amounts of capital.
On the bright side, NTES has outperformed the S&P 500 by 86.3% and its sector by 128.9% over the last five years. You should not take that kind of capital appreciation lightly.

2021-01-06 00:00:00+00:00,7 Hot Stocks to Buy Now Before They Take Off,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/7-hot-stocks-to-buy-now-before-they-take-off,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
The S&P 500 finished 2020 with a gain of 16.16% and more than 300 of its components posted positive annual returns. Statistics like that could imply upside for this year is limited, but there are still plenty of hot stocks to buy now that offer considerable potential.
Supporting the case for being constructive on stocks in 2021 is the sheer depth of where hot stocks hail from. Last year, the technology and consumer discretionary sectors were the two largest contributors to S&P 500 upside – themes that could remain in place this year as growth stocks remain in style and as the economy eventually reopens.
Likewise, there’s momentum for cyclical and value stocks based in part on the notion that the incoming Biden Administration will favor policies efficacious for sectors that scuffled a bit last year. There are other catalysts for hot stocks this year.
“Improving economic conditions likely will lead to greater business and consumer confidence, which should drive significant corporate earnings growth in 2021,” according to Wells Fargo. “This, coupled with the potential for increased fiscal spending and a moderation of tariffs, also may provide a tailwind to profits.”
With those factors in mind, here are some hot stocks to buy now in advance of 2021 gains.
8 Battery Stocks to Buy for Potentially Safer EV Exposure
Caesars Entertainment (NASDAQ:CZR)
Intel (NASDAQ:INTC)
Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT)
Nvitae (NYSE:NVTA)
DraftKings (NASDAQ:DKNG)
A10 Networks (NYSE:ATEN)
Nano Dimension (NASDAQ:NNDM)
Hot Stocks: Caesars Entertainment (CZR)
Source: Jason Patrick Ross/Shutterstock.com
Caesars finished 2020 higher by 24.53%, but the really impressive statistic regarding CZR stock is a run of 1,133.72% off the March 2020 lows. Neither of those figures mean investors should take a pass on the casino giant this year.
The gaming company is one of the hot stocks to buy now that has multiple tailwinds to justify that hot stock status. For example, some analysts believe that as more Americans take one of the novel coronavirus vaccines, the Las Vegas Strip’s recovery timeline will be sped along. That’s important for Caesars because it’s the second-largest operator on the Strip.
Even if the pace of recovery in Sin City remains sluggish, Caesars augments that by deriving a substantial portion of its revenue – 75% in the third quarter – from regional casinos. Regional gaming properties are recovering faster because gamblers can drive to those venues and don’t need to get on a plane as many would have to to get to Nevada.
Another factor in Caesars’ favor is the pending acquisition of William Hill (OTCMKTS:WIMHY).That deal, slated to close in the first quarter, will create a powerhouse in the iGaming and sports betting spaces, one with scale rarely seen in these still-nascent industries. Additionally, Caesars will defray some of the $3.69 billion purchase price by selling William Hill’s international businesses soon after the acquisition is finalized. That sale could command $2 billion or more.
Intel (INTC)

Laggard alert. Intel slumped almost 17% last year while the PHLX Semiconductor Sector Index surged 51%. That’s a staggering chasm for what was once the largest domestic chipmaker.
As has been seen over the history of the technology sector, Intel became a lumbering company that lost its way, due in part to ill-fated acquisitions. Now, some high-level investors smell blood in the water and they want to want to ensure Intel gets its act together.
Late last year, Third Point, the giant hedge fund run by Dan Loeb, took an activist position in INTC, admonishing company leadership for allowing the chip behemoth to fall so mightily.
“We cannot fathom how the boards who presided over Intel’s decline could have permitted management to fritter away the company’s leading market position,” Loeb wrote to Intel Chairman Omar Ishrak.
8 Cheap Stocks to Snap Up for the New Year
It’s not yet clear what Loeb’s near-term ideas for Intel are, but those concepts could center around him gaining board seats and perhaps forcing Intel to shed some lagging businesses that came into the fold via old acquisitions.
Caterpillar (CAT)
Source: aapsky / Shutterstock.com
The combination of ongoing geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and China and the Covid-19 pandemic could have been a toxic brew for Caterpillar last year, but CAT stock returned an admiral 23.25%.
If investors are going to nit pick with the construction and industrial machinery maker regarding 2020, it’s that Caterpillar didn’t raise its dividend. Good news: The payout, which has doubled since 2009 and been paid since 1933, wasn’t cut, either.
The stock offers upside potential in 2021 because the Biden Administration is likely to take a softer approach to China. Economic recovery historically results in upside for this name.
Some on Wall Street are enthusiastic on Caterpillar with Baird analyst Mircea (Mig) Dobre recently boosting his price target on the name to $220, implying upside of 21% from the Dec. 21 close.
One wildcard that could work in Caterpillar’s favor is Congress and the White House finally coming together on a massive U.S. infrastructure package. That could be a significant catalyst for CAT stock.

Investors looking for future disruption in the healthcare sector need not look much further than genomics equities, including Invitae. NVTA stock jumped 159.21% last year, but slid 18% in the final week of the year, indicating a dip may be afoot for risk-tolerant investors to embrace.
Invitae makes genetic tests and is pioneering concepts that turn those tests “into a single service with higher quality, faster turnaround time, and lower prices.” Investors shouldn’t underestimate the importance of declining genomics costs. As those costs come down, it makes genomics testing and applications more accessible to a broader swath of healthcare professionals and patients, explaining why many market observers are forecasting strong compound annual growth rates (CAGR) for the genomics industry over the next several years.

The intersections of DNA sequencing, gene therapies and artificial intelligence (AI) could, most importantly, improve patient outcomes while ushering in a new age of healthcare growth investing. How Invitae integrates recently acquired ArcherDX and its ability to diversify product offerings will go a long way toward determining equity performance this year.
DraftKings (DKNG)

DraftKings was one of the toasts of the publicly traded gaming universe last year as it surged 335.14%. Investors’ enthusiasm for the first pure play sports betting stock – DraftKings debuted last April – helped, as did an asset-lite model during the pandemic when sports returned.
I say this as a DraftKings shareholder: Don’t bet on DKNG stock quadrupling again this year, but there’s strong upside potential here on the back of more states embracing online casinos and sports wagering. Additionally, some of the newer sports betting states, such as Colorado, Illinois and Michigan, will get a full year under their belts, assuming the sports calendar remains somewhat normal.
Those are among the reasons some analysts see a $100 stock here. If nothing else, the aforementioned catalysts should drive top line growth in 2021.
An avenue for DraftKings to pleasantly surprise investors this year is to rein in customer acquisition costs, which could speed the timeline to profitability, which is expected to be 2023 or 2024.
A10 Networks (ATEN)

A10 Networks is a small-cap hardware and software provider. The real source of allure here being its software-as-a-service platform, which gives it strong cloud computing exposure. ATEN stock surged 43.52% last year.
Even with that impressive performance, it never closed above $11 and finished 2020 residing slightly below $10. Relative to the consensus price target of $14.25, A10 has potential upside of 44.5% in the eyes of Wall Street. Over the past five years, A10 lagged broader markets, but it turned the tide to profitable from losing money during the prior three years. Its return on equity (ROE) is decent at around 9%.

Demand for A10’s Thunder application delivery controller, which balances server data loads, is strong and the company’s Thunder threat protection system could be on a similar trajectory as more companies allocate financial resources to cybersecurity.
Nano Dimension (NNDM)

In the pantheon of disruptive technologies, 3D printing is one of the oldest and now one of the most overlooked. But Israel-based Nano Dimension gained almost 260% last year and there are reasons to believe more upside is available in 2021.
Last month, Nano Dimension said 10 customers upgraded to its 24/7 DragonFly LDM machines from the older DragonFly Pro machines. Remember, customers are embracing that upgrade during a global pandemic.
“By now, 66% of our customers world-wide already own DragonFly LDM 3D-Printing systems. The improvement of the Dragonfly LDM in comparison to the DragonFly Pro, among other things, is its ability to perform certain automatic maintenance functions during the additive manufacturing operation,” according to the company.
In November, Nano Dimension said it would sell $100 million in stock to raise cash, an offering that was later upsized to $250 million and those headlines weighed on the shares, but NNDM stock recouped those losses on DragonFly LDM sales. That’s the factor for investors to watch this year.
