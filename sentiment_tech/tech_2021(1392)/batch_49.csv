2021-01-05 00:00:00+00:00,Why AMD Stock Could Double Once Again in 2021,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-amd-stock-could-double-once-again-in-2021-2021-01-05,,,"Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) stock almost doubled in 2020. Market share gains against Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) in the CPU (central processing unit) space and strong sales of gaming hardware in the wake of the novel coronavirus pandemic helped the chipmaker record impressive top- and bottom-line growth throughout the year, and investors laughed all the way to the bank as a result.
But don't be surprised to see AMD replicate its performance in 2021, as the catalysts that drove its growth in 2020 are here to stay. Let's take a look at the key factors that could help AMD stock double once again this year.
AMD data by YCharts
AMD could become a more dominant CPU player
AMD has made massive strides in the CPU market against Intel in the past year. AMD reportedly held 22.4% of the x86 CPU market at the end of the third quarter of 2020, according to Mercury Research, its highest share in 13 years.
AMD has managed to chip away at Intel's CPU dominance thanks to its superior product line, which is based on a smaller manufacturing node, allowing it to deliver better computing performance and reduce power consumption. For example, AMD's recently released Ryzen 5000 series desktop processors can outperform their Intel counterparts according to independent benchmarks.

AMD could widen its advantage in 2021, as it is expected to refine its existing Zen 3 architecture. Supply chain gossip indicates that AMD could enhance its 7-nanometer (nm) manufacturing process to update the Ryzen 5000 series CPUs in the second half of the year. The gains are expected to be incremental compared to the current-generation CPUs also based on a 7nm node -- but Intel's troubles are likely to help AMD maintain its technological advantage.
The launch of Intel's 10nm desktop chips (which are expected to compete with AMD's 7nm chips) has been substantially delayed. Chipzilla is offering 10nm Tiger Lake chips only on laptops, giving AMD a free run in the desktop space, where the former is currently selling 14nm chips. What's more, Intel is expected to remain stuck on a 14nm manufacturing node for the better part of the year, as its 10nm desktop parts are expected only in the second half of the year.
AMD should have refined its 7nm process further by then, and getting ready to make the jump to the Zen 4 architecture (based on a 5nm node) in 2022. Meanwhile, Intel is expected to continue playing catch up: Its competing 7nm CPUs aren't expected to arrive until 2023, as the chip giant is a year behind schedule on the development of this platform.
Not surprisingly, AMD is expected to increase its x86 CPU market share significantly this year. Rosenblatt Securities analyst Hans Mosesmann predicts that AMD could boost its share to as much as 50% this year, which would be more than double where it stood at the end of the third quarter of 2020. So AMD's computing and graphics segment, which has delivered 47% revenue growth in the first three quarters of 2020, seems to have enough ammunition to sustain its hot run in the new year.
Enterprise and semi-custom will step on the gas
AMD's revenue from the semi-custom business more than doubled in the third quarter of 2020, rising 116% year over year to $1.13 billion. The chipmaker credits this terrific growth to two factors: higher sales of semi-custom chips, and a jump in server processor sales. The good news for AMD is that these two verticals are expected to sustain their terrific momentum in 2021, thanks to two major catalysts.
The first reason why AMD's semi-custom business could be on a roll this year is because of gaming consoles. The chipmaker is powering Sony's PlayStation 5 and Microsoft's Xbox Series X consoles, and these devices seem to be setting the sales chart on fire. Sony has reportedly sold 3.4 million PS5 units in just four weeks and is facing supply shortages because of huge demand.
The launch of the new-generation gaming consoles is expected to drive a big upgrade cycle, with one analyst estimating that the PS5 could hit over 200 million in sales. That would be almost twice the sales of the previous-generation PS4 console. And as the PS5 and the Xbox Series X have been launched only recently, they are likely to see strong demand over the coming months and help AMD boost sales.
AMD's market share gains in the server market space will be another growth driver for the EESC (Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom) business. According to IDC, the revenue of servers running AMD processors shot up 112.4% year over year in the third quarter of 2020, outpacing the broader market's revenue growth of just 2.2%.
This is a clear indication that AMD is rapidly gaining market share against Intel, currently the dominant player in the server processor market with a market share of 93.4%, according to Mercury Research. But AMD has eaten quickly into Intel's dominance and has an opportunity to give its top line a big boost by capturing more market share.
AMD estimates that the server processor market could be worth $19 billion by 2023. The chipmaker is on track to hit $1.5 billion in data center revenue this year, so it still has a lot of room to grow in this space. Citing industry sources, DigiTimes predicts that AMD's server market share could hit 20% by the end of 2021.
It wouldn't be surprising to see AMD live up to that ambitious forecast with its next-generation server processor, codenamed Milan, which is expected to hit the market in the first quarter of 2021. Leaked benchmarks indicate that the new Milan server processor could deliver substantial gains over its predecessor.
Analyst estimates compiled by Yahoo! Finance point toward nearly 27% growth in AMD's revenue in fiscal 2021, along with a 48% jump in earnings per share. AMD looks capable of delivering that kind of growth given the various catalysts it is sitting on, so it could remain a top growth stock -- and recreate its 2020 performance in the new year.

Even a global pandemic couldn’t slow down the market for chipsets — or the bullish sentiment surrounding Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) – for long. If you need evidence of this, check out the trajectory of AMD stock.

You see, AMD stock didn’t exactly double in 2020, but it came pretty close. There’s simply no denying that the bulls were fully in charge of the price action.
Not long ago, I issued a bullish recommendation on AMD stock. To back up my position, I pointed out the company’s highly impressive third-quarter revenue growth. But now I’m wondering, is it possible for a company to maintain such a robust growth rate?
Moreover, should prospective investors be concerned about the current valuation of AMD stock? We’ll explore these burning questions and more, but let’s start with a brief technical analysis.
A Closer Look at AMD Stock
Would you believe that AMD stock started off 2020 at the $49 level? It’s shocking but true, and so is the fact that the stock fell as low as $36.75 at one point during the year.
As it turned out, the buyers rushed in and bid up the AMD share price during the second half of 2020. On the final trading day of the year, AMD stock settled at an astounding $91.71.
Yet, there’s something even more astounding: AMD’s valuation. Currently, AMD stock’s trailing 12-month price-to-earnings ratio stands at a lofty 124.27.
8 Cheap Stocks to Snap Up for the New Year
Don’t get me wrong — I certainly wouldn’t expect AMD stock’s P/E ratio to be in the 20’s or 30’s after such a massive share-price run-up.
Nonetheless, value-focused investors are justified in expressing dismay over the valuation of these shares. Hence, I wouldn’t blame anyone for sitting on the sidelines and waiting for some of the air to be let out of the balloon, so to speak.
A Differing Opinion
It seems like everyone on Wall Street has an opinion on semiconductor stocks. And from what I’ve found, opinions lean toward the bullish.
For the analyst community, high P/E ratios don’t seem to be a source of concern lately. Mainly, they’re focused on the company’s growth prospects.
I’ll give you an example. Analysts from Mizuho Securities recently issued a slew of price target hikes for companies involved in the semiconductor space.
Among those companies, as you might expect, was Advanced Micro Devices. Mizuho hiked its price target on AMD stock to $102 from $93 while announcing a “buy” rating for the stock.
In defense of this, Mizuho analyst Vijay Rakesh generally predicted “strong year-over-year momentum and tailwinds from a supportive fundamental and macroeconomic backdrop” for the semiconductor industry.
Note the Competition
So again, the bullish argument centers not on value, but on momentum. If your thesis is that big companies will only get bigger in 2021, then perhaps a long position in AMD stock could make sense.
The potential problem here is that other companies aren’t just going to stand by idly and let Advanced Micro Devices dominate the market.
You might assume that I’m referring to rival chipmaker Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), and you’d be right. Yet, Intel isn’t the only major threat nowadays, as other famous tech names are now building their own advanced chipsets.
These include Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).
Those companies have deep capital reserves and brand-name recognition. Even beyond the fierce competition from Intel, AMD will have to fend off a growing pool of powerful rivals.
The Bottom Line
There’s still a lot to like about Advanced Micro Devices. The company offers powerful tech products and remains a dominant force in the market.
Still, value-oriented investors are justified in their concerns about AMD stock. Could the company and the stock continue growing at such a rapid pace? Maybe, but not everyone’s willing to bet their investing capital on that.

2021-01-04 00:00:00+00:00,Set Your Sights on Luminar Without Getting Burned,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/set-your-sights-on-luminar-without-getting-burned-2021-01-04,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
If you’re looking for a big-time growth opportunity in 2021 and beyond, Luminar (NASDAQ:LAZR) should be on your radar. But if you’re looking to park LAZR stock in your portfolio, laser-like focus on the stock chart and a well-aligned options strategy are optional investment equipment to get friendly with.  Let me explain.
Source: Oskari Porkka/ShutterStock.com
So, who or what is LAZR? Luminar is a recent SPAC (special purpose acquisition company) and technology startup which specializes in “light detection and ranging” technology, known as “lidar” for short. The company’s science is aimed at the autonomous or self-driving vehicle market. And lidar promises to be critical to making that dream a safe reality — with huge growth prospects in tow.
In a nutshell, lidar allows cars to see and respond to their immediate environment. As InvestorPlace’s Luke Lango explains, this is made possible by shooting laser beams and measuring their return paths. I’ll take his word the technology works. I’m still working on using a VCR.
More importantly, the industry is giving Luminar more than just lip service.
As Louis Navellier noted recently, Luminar has already scored more than 50 industry partners including seven of the top 10 global automotive OEMs (original equipment manufacturers). It’s the kind of traction to make LAZR a top player, if not the biggest, in the space. And with theglobal marketfor lidar devices estimated to reach $2.5 billion by 2025 according to Northland Securities, that could be a certain boon for LAZR.

But what about today — or even tomorrow, for that matter — as an investment as we enter 2021?
LAZR Stock Daily Price Chart

Source: Charts by TradingView
Today, even Northland sees LAZR as expensive. Well, kinda. At the stock’s recent all-time high the brokerage cut shares to “market perform.” That’s Wall Street’s way of saying “hold” without getting in trouble with potential business. It’s valued at 6x the expected valuation of the whole automotive lidar market by 2025. Given that, LAZR stock couldn’t be justified for anything stronger than a hold rating and a more-or-less market price target of $41 a share.
Maybe Northland should have warned anyway with a “sell” rating on Luminar? Right around the same time, well-watched short-seller Citron Research came out with a stern worse-than-a-casino warning on shares, stating LAZR was a “suckers game” with the stock fetching around $40.
Within a week of Citron’s bearish call, the stock cratered roughly 40% to touch $22.32 on Dec. 15. The decline was helped by word Intel’s (NASDAQ:INTC) Mobileye would be going with in-house lidar sensors for its self-driving car systems in 2025. If true, that would also end its relationship with Luminar. The price action and story was enough to find Northland countering its position on shares. Well, kinda.
The brokerage’s second go was to defend shares a bit less cautiously. LAZR was raised to “outperform.” Analyst Gus Richards believes the capabilities, supplier relationship and Intel’s priorities suggest Luminar won’t be displaced. That being said, the firm’s price target of $41 didn’t budge.
It turned into a nice swing trade for Gus’ followers. But after a couple weeks and a gain of about 35%, where’s that leave today’s LAZR stock investors? At the moment and entering 2021, the entirety of the back-and-forth between bulls and bears has resulted in a volatile triangular pattern.
For now, with shares situated near the formation’s apex and a supportive-looking stochastics setup, I’d wager the price action could turn into a continuation breakout play above resistance near $36.50. However, if a breakout was to enter the picture, my money would be on a slightly out-of-the-money and near-term bull call spread rather than eyeing shares as a core stock holding.

There are always deals to be had in the wake of the holiday season. For one, retailers often look to offload excess inventory after Christmas. But there are also always cheap stocks to buy in January. Now, following such an unprecedented year, the stock market will present opportunities to those shrewd enough to pay attention. 
Of course, the world is still in a pandemic. Covid-19 has devastated us globally. But it has also opened up opportunities in many cases.
7 Media Stocks That Could Light Up Your Gray Winter
Our economy has been shaken, but out of that there is money to be made in the stock market as sectors and equities rebound. So, here are seven cheap stocks to buy in January as the new year begins.
Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY)
Intel (NASDAQ:INTC)
Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV)
Aptiv (NYSE:APTV)
AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV)

Disney (NYSE:DIS)
Cheap Stocks to Buy: Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY)

Pharmaceutical companies live and die by the drugs they can develop and commercialize. To that end, Bristol-Myers Squibb counted seven commercialized drugs which produced over $1 billion in sales within the first nine months of 2020. Additionally, three of those drugs accounted for more than $5 billion each in sales over the same period.
But that doesn’t indicate that BMY stock is cheap. It could very well carry a lofty valuation given its ability to commercialize high-selling drugs. Yet, it doesn’t: its forward price-earnings ratio is 8.19. That ranks above 90% of the company’s peers.
Another important consideration for investors in pharmaceutical companies is patent expiry. Revlimid, BMY’s best-selling drug, will remain patent-protected through 2027 in the United States. Likewise, Eliquis — its second-best seller — has patents protected through 2026 and 2031. Finally, the company’s Opdivo is protected from generic competition through 2026. So, clearly Bristol-Myers Squibb has a strong competitive moat. That makes it one of the best cheap stocks to buy in January.
Intel (INTC)

Intel is not quite the chip manufacturing titan that it used to be — companies like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) have certainly taken the spotlight at the forefront of the semiconductor industry.
What’s more, the industry has generally had a great 2020. The iShares PHLX Semiconductor Index Fund (NASDAQ:SOXX) has risen 54.47% over the past one year. Likewise, AMD is up nearly 95% and NVDA is up about 127% in the same period. 
But INTC stock has shed some 15% over the same period. Why? For one, the company announced it would delay its new chip manufacturing until 2022. That hurt it significantly. On top of that, companies such as Apple (NASDAQ:APPL) are also likely to start manufacturing their own chips. So, Intel is facing stiffer competition in a historically competitive sector. 
While the company may never return to its former stature, though, I think it will certainly rise from its current position. In fact, just one piece of significant positive news will indicate to the markets that it has been undervalued relative to peers.  
Grading 10 of 2020's Hottest SPACs in Preparation for the New Year
Right now, INTC stock carries a 9.79 trailing price-earnings ratio while NVDA and AMD carry ratios of 85.49 and 123.93, respectively. That should tell an important story to investors seeking cheap stocks to buy in January, regardless of Intel’s tough 2020. 
Southwest Airlines (LUV)

Southwest Airlines might raise a few eyebrows as the next pick on my list of cheap stocks to buy in January. After all, the company has a forward price-earnings ratio that is worse than 95% of industry peers. The company also posted an earnings per share (EPS) loss of $3.01 for the trailing-12 months (TTM). Those two metrics make LUV stock look like a name to avoid at all costs. But we have to keep in mind that 2020 has been a year that has disproportionately affected the airline sector. 
Investors who look at the trailing-12 month EPS for industry peers like American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) and Delta (NYSE:DAL) will quickly realize that LUV has weathered the pandemic much better. Right now, Delta has an EPS loss of $16.53 and American a loss of $14.
Moreover, all three companies incurred massive losses due to exorbitant cash burn from their grounded fleets. Earnings suffered tremendously as a result. But, while daily passenger throughput is still down significantly, the vaccine news should help numbers start to return.
When it comes to picking a stock for the revival of airlines, then, Southwest is among the most financially sound operators in the industry. It will look cheap this time next year. 
Aptiv (APTV)

Aptiv isn’t on this list of cheap stocks to buy in January just because Wall Street favors it. For one, the company has also posted earnings beats in its recent past quarters. Markets tend to reward stocks that do that. 
Of course, though, there are a lot of electric vehicle (EV) players that are unjustly benefiting from the shift toward green vehicles right now. Some valuations look too high, given that many of the names run simply on hype and future promises of profitability. But Aptiv isn’t one of them. 
That’s why investors who are interested in EVs but afraid that the bottom might drop out of the market should consider APTV stock. In addition to its steady earnings beats, the company also has big goals beyond EVs. CEO Kevin P. Clark notes,“Aptiv is a technology company that will usher in the next generation of active safety, autonomous vehicles, smart cities and connectivity.”
The 7 Safest Stocks to Start Off 2021 on the Right Foot
And Aptiv has fared very well over the pandemic. Through the first nine months of 2020, revenues were a bit down, having dipped 17.7% compared to the same period of 2019. But Aptiv became much more operationally sound this year. Net income rose by 96.2% comparing those same two periods, despite the slightly lower revenue. 
Abbvie (ABBV)

Out of the 22 analysts who currently cover ABBV stock and are tracked by the Wall Street Journal, 14 of them consider it a buy. Moreover, their median price sits nicely at $118.50 and their high is $135. Clearly, they certainly feel that Abbvie is one of the cheap stocks to buy in January.
This Chicago-based pharmaceutical company has a few metrics that stick out to me, making it an affordable value stock. For one — from a pure value perspective — ABBV looks good because of its forward price-earnings ratio of 8.6. That’s 86.9% above its industry peers.
Secondly, although Abbvie isn’t particularly financially strong, it is capital efficient based on its weighted average cost of capital (WACC) versus its return on invested capital (ROIC). The company’s WACC is -5.44% and its ROIC is 26.67%. So, it’s clear that Abbvie knows how to create value from the capital it possesses. 
Finally, Humira is the pharmaceutical company’s cash cow. While the drug is facing competition, it still reported a Q3 sales increase of 7.7% in the United States, despite a 9.3% decrease internationally. Plus, ABBV will maintain U.S. patents on Humira through 2022 and anticipates sales declines from biosimilar drugs in 2023. 
So, this company has a strong pipeline and may very well thrive into 2023. At the very least, it looks like Abbvie will be a strong and affordable investment until then.
Howard Hughes (HHC)

Howard Hughes develops and operates planned communities and mixed-use properties. The company has 12 large communities under its control across the United States, in major cities like Chicago, New York, Honolulu and more. 
Although the company has seen an overall decrease in operating income from its assets through the first three quarters of 2020, there is good news. HHC’s largest operating asset business — office real estate –experienced a 39.1% increase in operating income in the same period of 2020. Office real estate accounts for over 60% of the company’s operating income. 
9 Long-Term Stocks for the Next Decade
Of course, Howard Hughes experienced significant disruptions in its retail and hospitality sectors in 2020 for obvious reasons. Surely these will remain hampered for the first half of 2021. However, the company can look forward to a turnaround sometime thereafter as the population becomes increasingly vaccinated. That means there’s a nice boon in store for HHC stock, landing it on this list of cheap stocks to buy in January.
Disney (DIS)

Last on my list of cheap stocks to buy in January is DIS stock. Of course, it’s fairly easy to understand the major problem that hurt Disney this year — its theme parks got hammered as the pandemic forced shutterings throughout 2020. The company succinctly summarized this issue in its Q3 earnings report:
“The most significant adverse impact in the current quarter and year from COVID-19 was approximately $2.4 billion and $6.9 billion, respectively, on operating income at our Parks, Experiences and Products segment due to revenue lost as a result of the closures or reduced operating capacities.”
However, the company has done well in 2020 in other ways, namely streaming. Disney anticipates that its already large 86.8 million strong subscriber base will swell up somewhere between 230 million to 260 million by 2024. 
Perhaps the company will shift its asset base to include a smaller mix of theme parks in the future. The pandemic certainly made the business risks of in-person entertainment clear. Regardless, though, Disney will see a surge in revenue in 2021 from both the recovery of its parks and its growing streaming platform. That will bolster the already hot House of Mouse.

2021-01-04 00:00:00+00:00,3 Comeback Stocks to Buy for 2021 Where Boring Is Beautiful,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-comeback-stocks-to-buy-for-2021-where-boring-is-beautiful-2021-01-04,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Today’s topic is a throwback to simpler times when Wall Street was still mostly run by humans. Now it’s a bunch of machines running artificial intelligence and algorithms outfoxing us warriors who are still doing it old-school.
The three companies in focus today are likely to be boring. The new breed of investors would rather chase a pie-in-the-sky than a full dish of current facts. Our picks could be the comeback stocks to buy for 2021.
They all will have one thing in common: great fundamentals but lackluster management styles. Leadership may even seem incompetent at times, which spells future potential. By that I don’t mean upside business potential, but rather the possibility of a resurgence in investor interest. They were once beasts in their field and now they are almost put out to pasture.
These are extreme statements that could insult the stocks and their fans. I am being borderline offensive on purpose to illustrate the lack of love and respect that they get nowadays. It is not a surprise to learn that these comeback stocks are down 35% to 50% from the highs. This is in spite of markets breaking records.
In the beginning of every year I pick a few long shots to be comeback stocks. These three are candidates but for slightly different reasons.
7 Media Stocks That Could Light Up Your Gray Winter
Intel (NASDAQ:INTC)
International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM)
AT&T (NYSE:T)
Comeback Stocks of 2021: Intel (INTC)
Source: Charts by TradingView
For a brief stint, Intel stock looked like a star in the summer of 2020. It all came crashing down as management disappointed with its results. The stock gave back the whole rally and another 10% from the low to boot. It mounted another effort in the fall, but that too ended in tears. In the process Intel stock went back to base and is teetering near it still.
What makes this worse is that the stock markets are making new highs. It is tough to watch a once-great stock flounder. From a trading perspective it seems that price is following technical rules perfectly. Both rallies ended once price filled the open gaps to the penny. Therefore, part of the thesis will be based on charts.
The fundamentals of Intel are solid but the danger comes from its two main competitors. Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) turned out to be fierce foes. They are out for blood and they have the innovation to back it up.
Intel is still sitting on its laurels because of the market share it once had. In the age where computers are lightening fast, technological changes are even faster. Once the tide switches there will be no turning back.
I’ve seen some sparks in their marketing efforts but it won’t be easy to sway investors. Wall Street will need concrete signs of life that at least they want to compete with the big boys. It is not a coincidence that it is more than 10 times cheaper that AMD or NVDA. You get what you pay for and it is definitely the bottom of the barrel.
So why bet on a turnaround? It’s too close to a disaster scenario and my bet would simply be that it won’t happen. If you eliminate one outcome, the other will become more likely to happen. Between a crash from these levels and a rally, I think an INTC stock rally is more likely.
IBM (IBM)
Source: Charts by TradingView
This one is the poster child of under-achievement in my book. For years I have been vocal about the need for a new CEO. That didn’t stop me from trading the upside potential in IBM stock. I shared a few good entry points and hopefully we can repeat performance. Finally last year Ginny Rometty stepped down from her post. The problem is that they promoted her replacement from within. I say it’s a problem because so far the tune has not changed, but am willing to wait.
IBM continually promises the moon and under-shoots with their results. In the last four years, instead of growing, revenues shrunk. Net income for the last 12 months is 30% smaller than 2016. Luckily this means that it has reasonable valuation and for good reason. In spite of that, I think they will end up succeeding in joining to new era of tech.
Technically, the bulls have an opportunity just above the current price. If they can sustain a rally for a few days they can recover $150 per share. There will be a lot of resistance in between here and there but all they need is a spark.
Management has all the elements for success, they just need to concentrate on what’s important. I don’t mean what’s the best business course of action. What I think is more important here is to give investors what they want. Fans of IBM stock simply want to see their beloved stock soar again. For this to happen management will need to speak to the contemporary talking points. This includes buzz words like the cloud. I don’t need to hear more about how their AI is doing great.
10 Best and Worst Calls of 2020
Perception is important on Wall Street and it would be good if management would help its investors. They stuck with it through the years and it’s about time the company throw them a bone. General Electric (NYSE:GE) did it last year and this year it could be IBM. I mention GE because it was one my 2020 bets that paid off immensely. IBM is due for something like this and soon. I think investors have waited long enough.
AT&T (T)
Source: Charts by TradingView
There is a theme happening now and that’s the mega rally in gold and bitcoin. This is a byproduct of how loose the central banks policies are, and not just in the U.S. They were already extremely loose prior to the pandemic and now they have gone off the deep end. Add to it that now the government is adding trillions in stimulus and we have a situation brewing.
The Fed has not yet exited the quantitative easing (QE) that it started after the 2008 financial crisis. They tried in 2018 and failed miserably. Now it’s a free for all and as a result there is no fixed income anywhere.
As a result, AT&T stock has an edge over a lot of stocks. It currently has a 7% dividend yield. As long as they have that, then there is a great incentive to own the stock.
In spite of its failed rallies, T stock has maintained a solid floor. Through thick and thin prices have bounced off the $26 zone in spite of tough conditions. Few can argue that 2020 wasn’t a difficult test and AT&T passed. There won’t be another one like it for a long time, if ever. The company does have a considerable amount of debt. But as long as they are able to generate cash to service it I bet the dividend remains in place.
TINA (there is no alternative) is an acronym that describes that investors have no other alternative than buy U.S. Bonds. I think it applies to stocks like T even better. The 10-year U.S. even after its recent rally barely pays 1%. AT&T’s is five times better without a lot of extra risk. Of course stocks are not guaranteed but nothing in life is. As aggressive as governments have been, I’d argue that the risk curve has been bent out of shape forever.
AT&T still generates a ton of net income with a reasonable price-to-earnings ratio of 19x. Most importantly, current investors have realistic expectations of the stock since its price-to-sales is under 2x. When forecasts are not lofty there is little room to the downside.
If the markets remain bullish, then T stock could swing into the $31 resistance by the end of January. If the bulls somehow can get above that then they could spark a rally to $35. Meanwhile, investors can collect the fat 7% reward.
Out of the three comeback stocks to buy today I favor Intel. It has the most focused opportunity on the charts. It is also clearly the worst of its class of three. Any progress can then quickly become clear.

It’s safe to say 2020 was a bad year for value investors. Growth investors saw massive gains in big tech and electric vehicle stocks. But for those taking more of a “Graham-and-Dodd” approach? Returns were not so great. Some of the worst investments of 2020 weren’t over-priced “story stocks,” but seemingly “cheap” value stocks.
Granted, with the novel coronavirus wreaking havoc on markets, value investing since March has been more about getting back to even as much as getting back to normal. Many value stocks saw dramatic rebounds in the months following the March Covid crash.
But, others so far have failed to bounce back. Not only that, in some cases, their share prices have continued to trend lower. True, 2021 may bring a rebound for many of these hard-hit and under-performing stocks. But, given each one is as much a value trap as it is deep value, the jury’s still out.
7 Media Stocks That Could Light Up Your Gray Winter
So, which value stocks have been some of the worst investments of 2020? These eight (to some extent) fit the bill:
Intel (NASDAQ:INTC)
Kroger (NYSE:KR)
Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY)
AT&T (NYSE:T)
Molson Coors (NYSE:TAP)
Vornado Realty Trust (NYSE:VNO)
Walgreens Boot Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA)
ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM)
Worst Investments of 2020: Intel (INTC)
Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com
Intel stock may have popped on news of Dan Loeb’s Third Point hedge fund taking an activist position in the floundering chip maker. But, with the company losing significant ground to high-flying rivals AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), trying to “buy the dip” in INTC stock has been quite like trying to catch a falling knife.
Trading at a single-digit forward price-to-earnings, or P/E ratio (9.6x), the stock (on paper) looks dirt cheap to AMD and Nvidia, which both sport P/Es well above 50x. But, given its market share losses and tepid growth prospects, it makes sense why investors have give Intel stock a highly discounted valuation.
And now, with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) moving chip design in-house, the venerable chip-maker now has another headwind on its plate. This news, coupled with Loeb’s activist campaign, highlights how Intel is fast becoming more like a tech has-been like Xerox (NYSE:XRX), rather than a resilient tech dinosaur like IBM (NYSE:IBM).
Those buying today may see a decent return in 2021. Especially if Third Point’s Loeb makes headway rattling the company’s cages. But, with its long-term prospects unclear, it may be best to avoid this tech value trap next year as well.
Kroger (KR)
Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com
Back in March, when markets overall were crumbling, KR stock was “crushing it.” As Americans rushed to grocery stores to stock-up for lockdowns, Kroger cashed in.
At the time, I recommended it as one of many “stockpiling” plays to buy as Covid-19 disrupted the U.S. economy. Yet, those who bought the news got in too late. Kroger stock saw additional gains through the middle of 2020. Since then, shares have fallen back below their “great American stockpile” price levels.
Given its low valuation (forward P/E of 9.5x), and recession-resistant business, many value investors may be tempted by this stock in 2021. I still see it as a great opportunity, including it in a recent list of reliable value stocks to buy in 2021. But, given that the valuation hasn’t been enough to entice investors, I concede the path to gains in the new year is not certain.
Grading 10 of 2020's Hottest SPACs in Preparation for the New Year
While it seems unfair to call this one of the “worst investments of 2020,” as shares generated a positive return in 2020. But, compared to the triple-digit moves of many “story stocks,” performance was disappointing. However, while you shouldn’t expect to get rich from this consumer defensive stock, the coming year could bring much better return for KR stock.
Occidental Petroleum (OXY)
Source: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com
Occidental Petroleum’s problems started long before the novel coronavirus. Its ill-timed merger with Anadarko Petroleum, the venerable oil exploration and production (E&P) company set the fire in motion. The pandemic — and its impact on oil prices — was the accelerant.
Yes, thanks to the continued recovery in crude oil prices, OXY stock has made a solid recovery. Trading for as low as $8.88 per share in March, the shares today change hands at around $17.30 per share. But, with the price far below pre-pandemic price levels (around $40 per share), those who got in before the crisis are still sitting on big losses.
Nevertheless, the recent bounce-back may be the start. Those who lost big on one of the worst investments of 2020 have a shot of narrowing their losses in 2021. Analysts over at Bank of America recently gave shares a “buy” rating, and a $29 per share price target. Why? As oil continues to climb, the company’s balance sheet risk isn’t as dire as previously thought.
With a potential bankruptcy less of a risk, the coming year may wind up a banner one for OXY stock. Volatility could continue, but this bad value play of 2020 could be a great buy on a pullback in 2021.
AT&T (T)
Source: Roman Tiraspolsky / Shutterstock.com
Most blue-chip stocks today trade above their coronavirus lows. But not Ma Bell. Soon after the crash, AT&T partially recovered. But, since the summer, T stock has trended lower, and today doesn’t trade far above its 52-week lows ($28.50 per share vs. $25.39 per share).
With its high dividend yield (7.3%), and low P/E (9x), many value investors see opportunity with this venerable telecom company. But, there’s good reason why investors overall have continued to shun this stock. With its high debt load, a result of its late 2010s merger spree, the company may have bit off more than it can chew. So far, the company has generated enough cash flow to service debt, and maintain its fat payout rate.
7 Media Stocks That Could Light Up Your Gray Winter
But, potential issues with its WarnerMedia unit, among other concerns, could mean a dividend cut is eventually necessary. One could argue that at today’s low valuation, Wall Street’s already pricing-in a cut. However, with many in this stock for the yield alone (7.23%), any sort of negative chance could fuel an investor exodus.
So, what’s the play with T stock in 2021? It still looks like a value trap. Be careful buying in the coming year what was one of the worst value plays of this year.
Molson Coors (TAP)
Source: OleksandrShnuryk / Shutterstock.com
Much like its rival, Anheuser-Busch (NYSE:BUD), beer giant Molson Coors’ issues didn’t start with the pandemic. Shares in the beer giant have fallen more than 50% in the past five years. Namely, due to the secular decline in beer popularity, especially among younger generational cohorts.
With its forward P/E of around 11x, value investors may see opportunity with the out-of-favor consumer staple stock. But, while TAP stock has bounced back on vaccine news, it’s debatable whether a vaccine-fueled recovery in 2021 will do anything to move the needle further.
Analyst projections calling for essentially zero earnings growth in the coming year, which makes sense given the long-term decline in North American beer sales. Even during the pandemic, when “stay at home” became “drink at home” for some, retail sales growth in beer has trailed that of spirits and wine.
However, it’s not as if Molson Coors is throwing in the towel as beer declines in popularity. Since a restructuring in 2019, the company has shifted focus toward higher-growth segments of the adult beverage industry.
As this Seeking Alpha contributor noted, the company’s shift into the hard seltzer and cannabis-infused beverage spaces help the company get out of its rut. Yet, even with the turnaround potential, poor performing value play TAP stock could continue to underperform in 2021.
Vornado Realty Trust (VNO)
Source: Anders Jildén via Unsplash
After Covid-19 hit the United States, New York office REIT (real estate investment trust) Vornado Realty Trust cratered from around $65-$70 per share, down to prices below $30 per share. And, as remote work remains the norm for many in corporate America, shares have failed to mount a meaningful recovery.
VNO stock today trades for around $37 per share. Some may have “bought the dip,” hoping to gain exposure to Manhattan real estate on the cheap. But, unlike prior real estate market downturns, this one may have more of a permanent impact on the health of the New York City office property market.
Grading 10 of 2020's Hottest SPACs in Preparation for the New Year
Sure, the idea of a “permanent remote work” environment may be more of a pipe dream than a megatrend. So much of New York’s top industries (like financial services) depend on person-to-person interaction. But, given the exodus of people (and businesses) from New York City following the outbreak, the office building sector in America’s top “gateway” real estate market could remain challenged for many years. Even if vaccine outlook calls for a mass return to the office by next summer.
In hindsight, the uncertainty weighing down on Vornado shares may look like a prime buying opportunity. But, for now, bottom-fishing in this Manhattan real estate play hasn’t been a winner for investors.
Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA)
Source: saaton / Shutterstock.com
As InvestorPlace’s Tom Taulli wrote Dec. 22, WBA stock was this year’s worst performer in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (NYSEARCA:DIA). Wall Street is by-and-large bearish on bricks-and-mortar pharmacies. Not only due to Covid-19, which has limited Walgreens Boots Alliance’s in-store sales. The specter of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) “disrupting” the traditional pharmacy business has been a big concern as well.
For contrarian investors, this bearishness may seem like opportunity. Shares trade for a single-digit P/E ratio (8.2x), and sport a sweet 4.74% forward dividend yield. But, with the aforementioned challenges, it may be tough for this value trap of 2020 to bounce back with a vengeance in 2021.
The sell-side community isn’t holding its breath. Some 86% of analysts give it the equivalent to a “hold” rating, 14% give it a more bearish rating, and 0% rate it as a “buy.” Yet, one could make the argument the company has been oversold due to aforementioned headwinds.
Given its exposure to the much-harder hit U.K via its Boots subsidiary, the company’s fortunes could see a massive improvement if vaccines solve the crisis both here and across the pond.
Bottom line: Of the “worst investments of 2020” discussed here, this may be one of the more appealing value opportunities.
ExxonMobil (XOM)
Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com
What else is there to say about ExxonMobil? The venerable blue chip oil company, humbled by the massive decline in oil prices, is in a tough spot. Yes, the recent bounce-back in crude oil bodes well for the company’s 2021 performance.
But, still operating in the red, and borrowing to pay its 8.43% dividend, oil may not rebound fast enough to solve Exxon Mobil’s problems. Something’s got to give, especially in the long-term. With President-elect Biden’s victory in November, the tide is continuing to turn against big oil.
As our own Matt McCall discussed back in November, the demographic and economic changes shifting us to a “green economy” aren’t going anywhere. Especially as “green” politics moves out of the fringe, and into the mainstream.
7 Media Stocks That Could Light Up Your Gray Winter
With XOM stock replaced by Salesforce (NASDAQ:CRM) after 92 years as Dow Jones component, the investment community as well may be phasing this out as a bellwether stock.
Now, its declining reputation as a venerable blue chip doesn’t necessarily mean it can generate great returns going forward. But, with 2021 success hinging on additional oil price gains, there’s not as much reason to dive into XOM stock, considering there are many ways to play an oil price recovery.

Further, with the rise in computing and gaming device sales, demand for the company’s products should pick up in the near to medium term, and the stock has the potential to rise around 20% to its early-2020 levels. Our conclusion is based on our comparative analysis of INTC stock performance during the current crisis with that during the 2008 recession in our interactive dashboard.
2020 Coronavirus Crisis
Timeline of 2020 Crisis So Far:
12/12/2019: Coronavirus cases first reported in China
1/31/2020: WHO declares a global health emergency.
2/19/2020: Signs of effective containment in China and hopes of monetary easing by major central banks helps S&P 500 reach a record high
3/23/2020: S&P 500 drops 34% from the peak level seen on Feb 19, as COVID-19 cases accelerate outside China. Doesn’t help that oil prices crash in mid-March amid Saudi-led price war
Since 3/24/2020: S&P 500 recovers 67% from the lows seen on Mar 23, as the Fed’s multi-billion dollar stimulus package suppresses near-term survival anxiety and infuses liquidity into the system.
In contrast, here is how INTC stock and the broader market fared during the 2007-08 crisis.
Timeline of 2007-08 Crisis
10/1/2007: Approximate pre-crisis peak in S&P 500 index
9/1/2008 – 10/1/2008: Accelerated market decline corresponding to Lehman bankruptcy filing (9/15/08)
3/1/2009: Approximate bottoming out of S&P 500 index
12/31/2009: Initial recovery to levels before accelerated decline (around 9/1/2008)
INTC and S&P 500 Performance Over 2007-08 Financial Crisis
We see INTC stock declined from levels of around $22 in September 2008 (pre-crisis peak) to levels of around $13 in March 2009 (as the markets bottomed out), implying INTC stock lost over 40% from its approximate pre-crisis peak. It recovered post the 2008 crisis, to levels of just above $20 in early 2010, rising by around 60% between March 2009 and January 2010. The S&P 500 Index saw a decline of 51%, falling from levels of 1,540 in September 2007 to 757 in March 2009. It then rallied to levels of 1,124, rising by about 48% between March 2009 and January 2010.
INTC Fundamentals Over Recent Years
INTC revenues increased from $55.4 billion in 2015 to $72 billion in 2019, due to higher revenues across all revenue segments. Along with higher revenue, earnings also jumped, with EPS rising from $2.41 to $4.77 during this period.
Does INTC Have Enough Cash Cushion To Meet Its Obligations Through The Coronavirus Crisis?
Intel’s total debt rose from $25.3 billion in 2016 to $29 billion in 2019, while its total cash decreased from around $8.8 billion to $5.3 billion over the same period. Further, the company generated around $33 billion cash from operations in fiscal 2019. This steady cash position combined with strong cash from operations provides the company a reasonable cushion to deal with the current crisis.
Conclusion
Phases of Covid-19 Crisis:
Early- to mid-March 2020: Fear of the coronavirus outbreak spreading rapidly translates into reality, with the number of cases accelerating globally
Late-March 2020 onward: Social distancing measures + lockdowns
April 2020: Fed stimulus suppresses near-term survival anxiety
May-June 2020: Recovery of demand, with gradual lifting of lockdowns – no panic anymore despite a steady increase in the number of cases
July-November 2020: Weak Q2 and Q3 results, but continued improvement in demand and progress with vaccine development buoy market sentiment
Despite the recent surge in the number of new Covid-19 cases in the U.S., we see the rise in computing and gaming device sales to continue on the back of the surge in online activity. We believe that Intel stock has potential upside in the near term, and even as the lockdowns are gradually lifted, a drop in computing device demand does not seem very likely. This could see Intel stock potentially rise over 20% from its current level.
What if you’re looking for a more balanced portfolio instead? Here’s a high quality portfolio to beat the market, with over 100% return since 2016, versus 55% for the S&P 500. Comprised of companies with strong revenue growth, healthy profits, lots of cash, and low risk, it has outperformed the broader market year after year, consistently.

Peter Lynch Stock Ideas
About Peter Lynch: Perhaps the greatest mutual fund manager of all-time, Lynch guided Fidelity Investment's Magellan Fund to a 29.2 percent average annual return from 1977 until his retirement in 1990, almost doubling the S&P 500's 15.8 percent yearly return over that time. Lynch's common sense approach and quick wit made him one of the most quoted investors on Wall Street. (""Go for a business that any idiot can run -- because sooner or later, any idiot probably is going to run it,"" is one of his many pearls of wisdom.) Lynch's bestseller One Up on Wall Street is something of a ""stocks for the everyman/everywoman"", breaking his approach down into easy-to-understand concepts.

2021-01-03 00:00:00+00:00,Should You Buy Intel on Recent Activist Investor Involvement?,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/should-you-buy-intel-on-recent-activist-investor-involvement-2021-01-03,,,"Despite a general boom in technology stocks this year, one big notable exception has been Intel (NASDAQ: INTC). Long known as the dominant player in the computer processor space, ""Chipzilla"" saw it moat against rivals deteriorate further this year due to internal technology problems, and the stock has responded by falling 14.7% in 2020, including dividends. That's a huge underperformance against the semiconductor sector, which gained a whopping 55.5% last year.
INTC 1 Year Total Returns (Daily) data by YCharts
Intel's underperformance and bargain-basement valuation of just 9.75 times earnings has recently attracted activist investor Dan Loeb to invest roughly a $1 billon stake in Chipzilla, after which Loeb sent a scathing letter to Intel's Chairman, demanding big changes.
Yet while Intel's stock jumped on the news, I'd still advise staying away from Intel at the moment for the following reasons.
An activist won't solve Intel's problems. Image source: Getty Images.
What Loeb said
Reading Loeb's letter to Intel's chairman, there doesn't appear to be any new news there. Basically, Loeb just castigated Intel for losing its manufacturing edge over the past seven years, while offering no real solutions except to ""retain a reputable investment advisor to evaluate strategic alternatives, including whether Intel should remain an integrated device manufacturer and the potential divestment of certain failed acquisitions.""
Yes, Loeb's point that top management was wildly overpaid while the company was falling behind on manufacturing is probably right, so some meaningful cost-savings could be accomplished. However, Loeb's mere pointing out the obvious won't help Intel's stock. Furthermore, Intel is already contemplating outsourcing some of its manufacturing to outside fabs. Meanwhile, completely divesting its own manufacturing may save the company in the short run, at which point Loeb could merely sell his stock, while damaging Intel's competitiveness longer-term.
Stuck between a rock and a hard place
Not too long ago, Intel was the envy of the chip world, and regularly out front of rivals in producing leading-edge processors. However, more and more of the industry went to a ""fabless"" model, in which companies would only design chips and outsource the complex and costly tasks of manufacturing to other foundries. That allowed Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM), the largest outsourced foundry by volume, to gain manufacturing expertise and leap ahead of Intel, reaching 7nm production before Intel could reach its 10nm chips -- which are, for some reason, equivalent to TSM's 7nm.
Taiwan Semi is already producing 5nm chips, while this summer, Intel disclosed yet another delay to its equivalent 7nm chips until 2022 or 2023. That would put Intel several years behind, and in a precarious position indeed.
In other words, part of what made Intel great is now its biggest liability. Therefore, the company is in between a rock and hard place. If it divests its fabs and goes fabless, it could then catch up to its rivals in terms of chip density; however, Intel would then sacrifice the very differentiated advantage that gave it an edge to begin with.
""Divesting"" seems like a short-term solution to a longtime problem
Loeb's other contention is that Intel should consider ""potential divestment of certain failed acquisitions."" Loeb probably has his eye on the Altera unit, which makes field programmable gate arrays, or customized chips, or Mobileye, the autonomous driving software unit.
And yet, if Intel was so wrong in purchasing Altera in late 2015, why did CPU rival Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) just purchase Altera rival and fellow FPGA-maker Xilinx? Clearly, there seems to be some advantage in being able to offer both CPUs and FPGAs under one roof, and coordinate systems-on-chip designs with both types of processors.
Meanwhile, Intel has actually already been divesting non-strategic assets, recently selling its NAND flash business to SK Hynix and also divesting its $314 million stake in big data platform Cloudera in just the past few months.
So, it appears that Intel is already doing some of what Loeb is suggesting. That being said, divesting everything except CPUs seems like a hatchet when a scalpel is probably best.
What Intel needs
Here's what Intel should do: fix what it screwed up, and get back to producing the best leading-edge chips in the world. Likely, that will take some new leadership, or at least a new culture that attracts the best tech talent to want to go work for Intel over rivals. I agree with former Cypress Semiconductor founder T.J. Rodgers, who called for such a change at Intel recently on CNBC.
Intel may need to use some outsourced fabs in the meantime to catch up to its rivals, but a wholesale shedding of its strategic assets won't exactly make it more competitive in today's super-competitive technology industry.
Of course, this fix won't be easy, and it won't happen overnight. It certainly won't happen if the company starts selling off parts of itself. Meanwhile, Intel seems as if it's going to continue losing market share in notebook and cloud processors over the next year-plus as it works to right the ship. During that time, its share price will likely remain depressed.
That's why I'd still stay away from this seemingly cheap stock until new leadership comes in, or a new direction is more clearly outlined.

The Vanguard Mega-Cap Growth ETF (NYSEMKT: MGK) increased 40% in 2020 due to its slant toward technology. With the world hastened into a new digital age because of the pandemic, 2021 could be another great year for big tech stocks. Three Fool.com contributors think salesforce.com (NYSE: CRM), Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) will be well worth your while.
A fair price for the future of work
Nicholas Rossolillo (Salesforce): Shares of cloud computing pioneer Salesforce were up over 60% at one point in 2020 as the company continued to grow even though many of its customers have been deeply impacted by the pandemic. Far from the days when this was a niche developer of customer relationship management software, Salesforce has become an integral part of daily operations for a growing list of organizations around the world.
Not surprisingly, returns moderated and the stock will finish out 2020 up ""only"" 37% on the year. What I do find surprising is how negative some investors have gotten on the company after its announced intention to acquire work collaboration tool Slack (NYSE: WORK). Salesforce is highly acquisitive, and CEO Marc Benioff and company often use its soaring stock price as a type of currency to acquire other high-growth technology names. Slack is no exception here, with about 40% of the deal to be funded with Salesforce stock. And while many investors aren't comfortable with acquisitions, Salesforce has a history of making deals like this work -- bolting on other software services to its core customer relationship platform to enhance its offering.
But Slack will be Salesforce's largest purchase yet, and there is concern that Slack -- which faces stiff competition from the likes of Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) Teams -- isn't a good fit. I'd argue to the contrary. Benioff has been clear for a long time about his ambitions to make his company one of the largest in the world, and making the transition from Salesforce the software vendor to Salesforce the heart of an organization's technology stack will require some help. Specifically, Salesforce will integrate the remote collaboration tool across all of its products and make Slack the default interface for its ""Customer 360"" product -- a singular place for users to connect an organization's apps, data, and customer information, all the while collaborating with co-workers from afar.
If Salesforce can make it work, it could be a transformational move, one that Benioff expects will make his company ""the operating system for the future of work."" I like the ambition, even if it stomps on the toes of big names like Microsoft that already dominate the operating system and basic tech platform market. With a history of making acquisitions like Slack add up to more than the sum of their parts, I'm bullish on Salesforce headed into the new year and as effects of the pandemic start to ease.

This fallen giant will not stay down
Anders Bylund (Intel): Semiconductor titan Intel had a difficult year in 2020, even though the chip sector as a whole absolutely crushed the S&P 500's returns this year. The contrast is flat-out startling:
^SOX data by YCharts
At the end of the year, Intel shares are trading at historically low valuation ratios. You can pick up Intel shares for less than 10 times adjusted earnings, less than 10 times free cash flows, and roughly 2.5 times trailing sales. All of these metrics are running near their 10-year lows. They are also far below the valuation ratios seen in other large semiconductor stocks, including well-worn value investments such as Texas Instruments (NASDAQ: TXN) and Analog Devices (NASDAQ: ADI).
This makes sense only if you believe that Intel's manufacturing hiccups in 2020 are a sign of imminent doom. The stock should be cheap if Intel were on a hopeless path to total collapse.
That's not what's happening here. Intel's stock is way too cheap right now, and the shares you buy today are incredibly likely to be worth much more by the end of 2021.
Armed with an ironclad balance sheet, an unmatched network of in-house manufacturing facilities, and the industry's largest research and development budget, Intel is poised to make a full recovery as soon as this year's manufacturing issues have been corrected. Management says that we should expect Intel's 7-nanometer process to be fully operational in 2021, getting the company's famous tick-tock cadence back on track again. At the same time, Intel is exploring new target markets such as 5G-powered Internet of Things devices, self-driving cars, and telehealth.
This fallen giant won't stay down for long. Intel is going places in 2021 and investors are invited to enjoy the ride.
Believe it or not, Alphabet is a reopening stock, and still cheap
Billy Duberstein (Alphabet): Google parent Alphabet was one of my top stocks for 2020, and you know what? I still like it for 2021.
Sure, the company has been buffeted by the COVID-19 pandemic, which hit ad revenues hard in the first and second quarters. And yes, the company is squarely in the sights of antitrust regulators in the U.S. and abroad. However, that also may explain why Alphabet looks rather cheap compared to its peers right now. Given that antitrust trials aren't slated to begin until 2023, it should be business as usual for Alphabet for quite a while.
Meanwhile, Alphabet's core advertising revenue rebounded more strongly than expected in the third quarter, up almost 10% over the prior-year quarter. Even more impressive, the ""Google other"" division, which is a mix of YouTube subscriptions, app store sales, and hardware, surged 35.3%. The ascending Google Cloud platform grew an even higher 44.8%. Importantly, management noted on the recent conference call that the underlying Google Cloud platform IaaS service is growing faster than the overall segment, which also includes software like G Suite.
If Google Cloud were valued like a stand-alone software-as-a-service company, it could be worth 20, 30, or even 40 times sales, given that level of growth. Given that the segment is on track to make about $13 billion in revenue this year, one could easily value Google Cloud between $260 billion and $560 billion right now! Currently, Alphabet's total market cap is less than $1.2 trillion, or about $1.06 trillion, excluding cash.
Alphabet also may have significant value hidden in its ""other bets"" segment. The autonomous driving unit Waymo raised money early this year at a $30 billion valuation just before the pandemic hit. However, given what other EV and new-age technology stocks have done this year, it's not hard to think that value would be much higher today. Additionally, Alphabet's Verily Life Sciences unit is likely quite valuable as well, as it's using new technologies to solve big medical problems, and even has a unit dedicated to COVID-19 testing and solutions. And Alphabet's other bets segment also includes its venture arm and later-stage growth investment arms, with billions under management.
Meanwhile, Alphabet's ""core"" business should continue to recover with the economic reopening next year, as travel and experience-related advertisers return to Google's platforms. The core Google business has made nearly $30 billion in operating income through the first three quarters of this year despite the pandemic, on the way to $40 billion or more this year and accelerating to mid-teens growth next year.
Given the neglected cloud and other bets business, a core business that should reaccelerate in 2021, and increasing share repurchases, Alphabet is still looking like a great value among large-cap tech going into the new year.

2021-12-29 00:00:00+00:00,Marvell Technology: Another Semiconductor Play Worth Watching,MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/marvell-technology%3A-another-semiconductor-play-worth-watching,,,"I am neutral on Marvell Technology (NASDAQ: MRVL) as its near-unanimous support from Wall Street analysts and massive growth potential are offset by its significantly elevated valuation relative to its recent historical averages.
Marvell Technology is an American technology company that produces semiconductors and other related products and services. The company was founded in 1995 and is based in Delaware.
Strengths
Marvell Technology has over 10,000 patents across the globe with 5,340 employees. The company has made many strategic acquisitions, including that of Cavium, a fabless semiconductor company.
In 2019, the company completed the purchase of Aquantia, a high-speed transceiver company and in 2021, it acquired Inphi, another semiconductor company.
Most recently, the company completed the acquisition of Innovium on October 5, 2021, just 25 days before the end of its third quarter of 2022.
Recent Results
Marvell reported revenue of $1.21 billion for the quarter ended October 2021, which exceeded the guidance provided by the company in August. The company’s revenue saw a 13% growth quarter-over-quarter and 61% growth year-over-year.
Increases were substantial in all five of the company’s segments, particularly Data Center, which contributed 41% to total revenue and grew 15% from the previous quarter, and 109% from the previous year’s quarter.
Marvell has beaten consensus revenue estimates over the past four quarters, consecutively.
The company also posted a GAAP net loss for the third quarter of 2022 of $63 million or a loss of $0.08 per diluted share. Non-GAAP net income for the third quarter of 2022 was $364 million, or earnings of $0.43 per diluted share.
For the fourth quarter of 2022, Marvell is expecting revenue to be approximately $1.32 billion, give or take 3%, primarily attributed to 5G, which is expected to improve by 30% from the third quarter.
The company also expects its GAAP gross margin to show improvement in the range of 47.9% and 49.8%, while its GAAP operating expenses are expected to be between $630 and $640 million.
Valuation Metrics
MRVL stock looks richly priced right now as its EV/EBITDA ratio is 34.5x compared to its five-year average multiple of 19.6x, and its P/E ratio is 42.2x compared to its five-year average multiple of 25.5x.
That said, it is expected to grow revenue by over 33%, EBITDA by over 40%, and normalized earnings by over 51% over the next year.
Wall Street’s Take
From Wall Street analysts, MRVL earns a Strong Buy analyst consensus based on 23 Buy ratings, two Hold ratings, and zero Sell ratings in the past three months. Additionally, the average Marvell price target of $100.56 puts the upside potential at 13.7%.
Summary and Conclusions
Marvell Technology is a rapid grower in a red-hot industry. As a result, it has very strong growth potential for the foreseeable future and enjoys near unanimous support from Wall Street analysts.
That said, investors should keep in mind that the valuation multiples look quite elevated here relative to recent historical averages.

2021-12-22 00:00:00+00:00,7 of the Best Tech Stocks for 2022 to Buy Now,MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/7-of-the-best-tech-stocks-for-2022-to-buy-now,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
December has been a choppy month for even the best tech stocks. Yet, the tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 index has returned about 20% so far in 2021. Now investors wonder what might be in store for these high-growth shares in the new year.
In the past 12 months, gains have not been evenly distributed. While mega-tech stocks have dominated the index’s performance, many widely-followed technology names have seen their share prices decline.
In particular, consumer electronics, cybersecurity and cleantech shares have had wild swings. Profit-taking, surging inflation, supply chain issues, and the emergence of the omicron variant have been reasons behind the recent volatility.
7 Stay-At-Home Stocks to Buy as Remote Work Lingers On
Nevertheless, these declines also offer better entry points to many growth names that are likely to announce solid financials in the quarters ahead. Such stocks represent great buying opportunities, particularly if investors can identify those with solid fundamentals, reasonable valuations, and profit from their momentum and growth.
With that information, here are seven of the best tech stocks that are likely to create shareholder value for many quarters to come:
Ambarella (NASDAQ:AMBA)
Ciena (NYSE:CIEN)
Dell Technologies (NYSE:DELL) 
iShares Cybersecurity and Tech ETF (NYSEARCA:IHAK)
Marvell Technology (NASDAQ:MRVL) 
Synaptics (NASDAQ:SYNA)
Upstart (NASDAQ:UPST) 
Best Tech Stocks: Ambarella (AMBA)

52-week range: $82.59 – $227.59
Ambarella designs semiconductor processing solutions, mainly for high-definition (HD) video capture, sharing, and display. Ambarella’s products are found in segments ranging from artificial intelligence (AI) to computer vision, security and driver-assistance cameras.
Ambarella reported Q3 FY22 results in late November. Revenue increased 64% year-over-year (YOY) to $92.2 million. Non-GAAP net income came in at $22.2 million, or 57 cents per diluted share, up from $3.3 million, or 9 cents per diluted share, in the prior-year quarter.
Total cash and equivalents ended the quarter at $458 million. Meanwhile, management increased Q4 revenue guidance 45% YOY to $90 million.
“Our operational execution remains strong, yet supply dynamics remain difficult to predict, as shortages of other companies’ components has become a more significant and gating factor to our results and outlook,” CEO Fermi Wang remarked following the announcement.
The company has seen rising demand for chips used in cameras utilized in the automotive market as well as security applications. AMBA stock hovers at $195 per share, up nearly 115% year-to-date (YTD).
Shares are trading at 119 times forward earnings and 21.4 times trailing sales. Interested readers could find better value around $170, but the 12-month median price forecast for Ambarella stock stands at $227.
Ciena (CIEN)

52-week range: $47.52 – $75.45
Ciena provides network hardware and software that facilitate the delivery of video, voice and data traffic over communications networks.
Analysts note that 5G networks and data centers have been driving robust demand for Ciena’s products and solutions.
Management issued solid Q4 results on Dec. 9. Revenue increased 26% YOY to $1.04 billion. Adjusted net income soared to $132.7 million, or 85 cents per diluted share, up 42% YOY from $94.5 million, or 60 cents per diluted share, in the prior-year quarter. Cash and equivalents ended the quarter at $1.4 billion.

“Orders in the quarter were once again significantly higher than revenue,” CEO Gary Smith remarked on the metrics. “And with our third consecutive quarter of orders outpacing revenue, we have substantial momentum and increased confidence in the demand environment.”
Ciena has recently partnered with Samsung Electronics (OTCMKTS:SSNLF) to support its 5G deployment. Through this collaboration, telecom operators should be able to better manage the increase in their 5G data volumes.
The stock is moderately valued, making CIEN stock an attractive bet for investors looking to buy a 5G stock. CIEN stock hovers around $75 territory, up 47% YTD. Shares are trading at only 21.7 times forward earnings and 3.2 times trailing sales. The 12-month median price forecast for Ciena stock is  $83.
Best Tech Stocks: Dell Technologies (DELL)

52-week range: $35.56 – $59.49
Dell Technologies is a well-known information technology (IT) name that operates mainly through two segments. The Client Solutions Group provides IT solutions such as hardware and peripherals. And the Infrastructure Solutions Group offers software, storage and server solutions.
The company announced strong Q3 FY22 results in late November. It generated record revenue of $28.4 billion, up 21% YOY. Non-GAAP net income stood at $2 billion, or $2.37 per diluted share, up from $1.7 billion, or $2.03 per diluted share, in the prior-year quarter. Cash and equivalents ended the quarter at $23.4 billion.
“We continue to deliver strong results, with more than $13 billion in cash flow from operations on a trailing-twelve-month basis, the digital trends are tailwinds for our business, and along with our strategy and financial flexibility, lead us to be optimistic about our long-term growth prospects,” CFO Tom Sweet remarked on the results.
On Nov. 1, Dell spun off its 81% stake in VMware (NYSE:VMW). The move will allow the company to reduce debt and offer dividends as well as share buybacks.
Despite delivering its best third-quarter results in history, DELL is still trading at a reasonable valuation relative to its peers. The stock hovers at $55 territory, up about 96% YTD.
Shares look more like a value stock trading at just 6.6 forward earnings and 0.4 times trailing sales. The 12-month median price forecast for Dell stock stands at $65.
iShares Cybersecurity and Tech ETF (IHAK)
Source: Shutterstock
52-Week Range: $36.35 – $49.09
Dividend Yield: 0.52%
Expense Ratio: 0.47% per year
In 2020, the global cybersecurity market was valued at more than $150 billion and is expected to exceed $350 billion by 2026. Such growth would mean a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of about 14.5%.
Therefore, we next look at an exchange-traded fund (ETF), namely the iShares Cybersecurity and Tech ETF that invests in cybersecurity shares. The fund started trading in June 2019.
IHAK, which has 52 holdings, tracks the NYSE FactSet Global Cyber Security Index. The top 10 names make up about 43% of net assets of $640.4 million. In terms of sub-sectors, we see IT (90.18%), followed by industrials (9.47%).
7 of the Best Clean Energy Stocks for 2022 to Buy Now
Among the leading names on the roster are the electronic signature platform DocuSign (NASDAQ:DOCU); Fortinet (NASDAQ:FTNT), which provides cybersecurity services and products; Juniper Networks (NYSE:JNPR), which offers network security software and products; software-as-a-service (SaaS) provider Citrix (NASDAQ:CTXS); and CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD), which offers an endpoint security platform.
The ETF is up about 10% this year. It hit an all-time high on Nov. 9. Since then, shares in IHAK have come under pressure and lost about 14%. The fund’s P/E and P/B ratios stand at 28.36x and 6.93x. Interested readers would find better value around $40.
Best Tech Stocks: Marvell Technology (MRVL) 
MRVL) technologies office campus"" width=""300"" height=""169"">
Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com
52-week range: $37.92 – $93.85
Dividend yield: 0.29%
Marvell Technology provides infrastructure semiconductor solutions, especially for data centers and telecom operators, as well as enterprise networking and industrial markets.
The company released solid fiscal Q3 FY22 results on Dec. 2. Total revenue came in at $1.21 billion, an increase of 61% YOY. Non-GAAP net income stood at $364 million, or 43 cents per diluted share, up from $284 million, or 34 cents per diluted share, in the prior-year quarter. Cash and equivalents ended the period at $523 million.
Wall Street points out that 5G networks, cloud computing, and consumer electronics offer further growth opportunities. As Marvell benefits from positive momentum across all these segments, we should see continued earnings growth in 2022, which is what makes this among the best tech stocks out there.
In October, Marvell announced the acquisition of Innovium, which offers networking solutions for cloud and edge data centers. The company has also acquired Inphi, a leading name in high-speed data movement, which enhances Marvell’s cloud and 5G opportunities.
Management has also raised the outlook for the rest of the year, projecting revenue to reach $1.32 billion with adjusted EPS in the range of $0.45 – $0.51.
MRVL stock hovers at $86 per share, up nearly 87% in 2021. Shares are trading at 37.5 forward earnings and 15 times trailing sales. A potential decline toward $80 or even below would increase the margin of safety. The 12-month median price forecast for MRVL stock is $100.
Synaptics (SYNA)

52-week range: $79.22 – $299.39
Synaptics offers semiconductor products for mobile devices and PCs as well as the Internet of Things (IoT) markets worldwide.
It is well-known for human interface solutions enabling touch, display, fingerprint and other connectivity functions for a range of electronics products.
Synaptics reported Q1 FY22 results in early November. Revenue increased 13% YOY to $372.7 million. The company has seen rising demand for its IoT solutions, accounting for over half of the revenue.
7 of the Best Value Stocks for 2022 to Buy Now
Non-GAAP net income came in at $109 million, or $2.68 per diluted share, up from $66.7 million, or $1.85 per diluted share, in the prior-year quarter. Cash and equivalents ended the quarter at $347 million.
“Synaptics delivered a strong start to our fiscal year 2022 with first-quarter revenue above the mid-point of our guidance, non-GAAP gross margin at the highest level in the company’s history, and non-GAAP operating margin hitting another record,”CEO Michael Hurlston remarked after the announcement.
In August, the company announced the acquisition of DSP Group, a leading global provider of voice processing and wireless chipsets. “We continue to invest in technologies that tilt our product mix toward IoT applications,” cited Michael Hurlston.
SYNA stock hovers at $260 territory, up 165% YTD. Shares are trading at 26 times forward earnings and 7.6 times trailing sales. Investors would find better value around $250 or even below. The 12-month median price forecast for MSYNA stock stands at $287.50.
Best Tech Stocks: Upstart (UPST) 
Source: Postmodern Studio / Shutterstock.com
52-week range: $22.61 – $401.49
Upstart is a consumer lending platform. It relies on AI and machine learning technologies to make loan approval decisions.
Wall Street regards Upstart as a significant financial technology (fintech) disruptor. Instead of a FICO credit score, the company relies on various algorithms to build a personalized consumer profile. Many banks, especially smaller financial institutions, are partnering with the platform.
Management issued Q3 financials in early November. Revenue came in at $228 million, representing a record 250% YOY increase. Adjusted net income stood at $57.4 million, or 60 cents per diluted share. Cash and equivalents ended the quarter at $111 million.
“Since Upstart’s IPO a year ago, we’ve more than tripled our revenue, tripled our profits, tripled the number of banks and credit unions on our platform, and tripled the number of auto dealerships we serve,” CEO Dave Girouard remarked. “With that many 3s, Upstart is becoming the Steph Curry of the FinTech industry.”
The level of consumer credit outstanding stateside is well over $4 trillion. Therefore, a young company like Upstart still has plenty of room for growth. UPST stock currently hovers around $133, up 240% YTD.
However, shares do not look cheap at 17.5 times trailing sales. Interested readers would find better value around $120. It trades today just shy of $150. The 12-month median price forecast for the stock is $290.

The central bank's aggressive stance on managing the stickier-than-expected inflation can prove to be a major headwind for several growth stocks. Especially those relying excessively on cheap capital. However, fundamentally strong companies with several growth catalysts and robust financial performance could easily withstand those headwinds.
Companies like Marvell Technology (NASDAQ: MRVL) and Halozyme Therapeutics (NASDAQ: HALO) can prove to be attractive picks for retail investors, even if they have only $1,000 to invest. Here's why.
Image Source: Getty Images.
1. Marvell Technology
Shares of data-infrastructure, semiconductor-solutions player Marvell Technology soared by over 17% after it posted stronger-than-expected fiscal 2022 third-quarter results. Revenue soared 61% year over year to $1.2 billion, while adjusted net income jumped 116% year over year to $364 million. Data center and automotive segments have emerged as the key growth areas for Marvell.
The rapid adoption of cloud computing has been driving demand for Marvell's data center-focused, cloud-optimized silicon products, and software offerings. In Q3, revenue from the data center market soared 109% year over year to $499.7 million, making up almost 41% of the company's total revenue. After the acquisition of Inphi (high-speed electro-optics portfolio) and Innovium Technology (networking switches for cloud and edge data centers), Marvell now boasts an end-to-end cloud infrastructure portfolio and is landing several new design wins from its enterprise clients.
Marvell is also targeting the Ethernet Automotive Integrated Circuit (ICs) market worth $1 billion. The modern autonomous vehicle comprises many sensors, central processing units (CPUs), and cameras -- all of which have to be connected with each other. Furthermore, the car has to connect securely with external WiFi and 5G networks, with other cars, and with the cloud. Ethernet networking is used inside the car to fulfill the quality-of-service and bandwidth requirements. In Q3, Marvell raked in $140 million in revenue from this business. With seven out of the top 10 automotive original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) purchasing Marvell chips, the company is set for a solid growth trajectory in this market.
Marvell expects the evolving metaverse to be a big growth driver for its networking and storage business in the coming years. Particularly due to the need for huge data storage in secure environments and high-speed networking for low latency. In view of several growth catalysts, I remain strongly bullish on this stock.
2. Halozyme Therapeutics
Halozyme Therapeutics is undoubtedly one of the safest biotech picks thanks to its robust revenue growth trajectory and solid margins. The company's proprietary drug delivery technology ENHANZE enables change in the process of treatment for several drugs from intravenous to subcutaneous. This technology helps reduce the drug administration time from several hours to only minutes.
Since patients can now receive treatment at home instead of in a hospital setting, the ENHANZE platform is playing a major role in reducing overall healthcare costs and the burden of care on patients and caregivers. Halozyme has entered into licensing agreements for the ENHANZE platform with eleven prominent biopharmaceutical companies. ENHANZE is already being used in five commercialized partner drugs, with potential global sales of $22 billion in 2024.
Royalties (average mid-single-digit percentage of global sales of the partnered drugs) accounted for around 35% of Halozyme's total sales in 2020. With the company expecting Federal Drug Administration (FDA) approvals for more than five additional partnered drugs and more than five products entering phase 3 clinical trials, royalties are expected to account for around 60% of its total revenue. Halozyme has projected its royalty revenue to grow annually at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 40% from $89 million in 2020 to around $1 billion in 2027.
The pharmaceutical industry is rapidly opting for antibody-based drugs over small-molecule oral therapies. Halozyme stands to benefit from new collaboration agreements as well as new drug-development programs. These would be an addition to the company's current projections for royalties. The company also expects co-formulation patents filed by partners to significantly extend the royalty period beyond 2024 in Europe and 2027 in the U.S.
HALO Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts
Unlike many biotech companies, Halozyme boasts strong financials. The company's trailing-12-month revenues are up 132% year over year to $463 million, while net income soared by 1,800% year over year to $409.1 million. With the share of royalties (recurring revenue) as a percentage of the total revenue expected to grow, the company will also witness a solid improvement in overall revenue visibility.
Halozyme also has a very strong balance sheet, with $815.9 million in cash and cash equivalents, and $879.1 million in debt at the end of Q3 (ending Sep. 30, 2021). Holding a solid product offering, improving financials, and a robust balance sheet, the stock is well-positioned to grow rapidly in the coming years.

Cyclical stocks appear to be back in vogue in the stock market now. For the most part, this would be thanks to the Federal Reserve’s latest call on its monetary policies. Namely, the Fed’s are speeding up their taper plans and are looking to introduce an interest rate hike next year. Among the core reasons for this would be the current state of the U.S. economy. Thanks to consumer markets with generally strong balance sheets and aggressive vaccination efforts, the reopening trade continues to flourish. With all that said, it comes as no surprise that investors are eyeing the top cyclical stocks around now.
At the same time, companies in the cyclical space are not sitting idly by as well. On one hand, you have industrial names such as Boeing (NYSE: BA) catering to increased demand for aircraft. In fact, the firm is already looking towards newer ways to refine its engineering process. Earlier today, the company revealed plans to design new aircraft in the metaverse. This, in theory, would be done via immersive 3-D engineering software by mechanics worldwide connected via augmented reality headsets.
On the other hand, you also have consumer discretionary names like Nike (NYSE: NKE) to consider as well. To keep with the latest trends in the consumer’s collectibles market, Nike acquired RTFKT. With this non-fungible token (NFT) studio, it could be looking to expand its portfolio of collectibles to the digital space. By and large, with all this activity among cyclical stocks now, you might be keen on the sector yourself. Should that be the case, here are four top cyclical stocks to consider in the stock market now.
Best Cyclical Stocks To Watch This Month
Canopy Growth Corporation (NASDAQ: CGC)
Marvell Technology Inc. (NASDAQ: MRVL)
Winnebago Industries Inc. (NYSE: WGO)
Wells Fargo Inc. (NYSE: WFC)
Canopy Growth Corporation
Canopy Growth is a Canadian-based cannabis cultivator and provider of cannabinoid-based consumer products. For starters, the company offers weed enthusiasts a wide array of offerings worldwide. This ranges from high-quality dried flowers, cannabis oils, infused beverages, and vaporizers, just to name a few. Through its owned and partnered cannabis production platforms, the company has created a dominant, global business with the potential to generate a significant and sustainable return for its shareholders.
On Wednesday, the company announced that it has entered into an agreement to divest its subsidiary business, C3 Cannabinoid Compound Company to Dermapharm Holding SE. With this divestiture of C3, Canopy Growth will continue its evolution into a CPG-modelled organization and further its strategy of driving focus and consistent business across its core markets. The company will continue to leverage its high-quality supply of Canadian cannabis products for the medical channel in its core international markets. Given this piece of news, is CGC stock worth buying right now?

Marvell Technology Inc.
Following that, we have Marvell, a company that develops and produces data infrastructure semiconductor solutions for various sectors. It first revolutionized the digital storage industry by moving information at speeds never thought possible. Today, that same breakthrough innovation remains at the heart of the company’s storage, network infrastructure, and wireless connectivity solutions. MRVL stock is up by over 15% in the past month.
Recently, Jefferies (NYSE: JEF) analyst Mark Lipacis maintained a ‘Buy’ rating on Marvell, setting a price target of $105. Last week, the company was awarded two Global Semiconductor Alliance (GSA) Awards in the category of “Most Respected Public Semiconductor Company” for companies achieving $1 billion to $5 billion annual sales, and the “Analyst Favourite Semiconductor Company”. This would mark the third time that Marvell has received recognition from GSA. With the global chip shortage likely to persist into 2023, should you include MRVL stock on your watchlist today?

Winnebago Industries Inc.
Another name to consider among cyclical stocks today would be Winnebago Industries. In essence, Winnebago is a manufacturer of recreational vehicles (RVs). Notably, it is the leading provider of outdoor lifestyle products in North America. Through its Winnebago, Grand Design, Chris-Craft, and Barletta brands, the company caters to consumers’ leisure travel and outdoor recreation needs. Now, with the Omicron Covid variant impacting international travel, consumers could be turning to Winnebago’s RVs instead. As a result, some would argue that this could lead to WGO stock gaining traction in the stock market.
More importantly, WGO reported its latest quarterly earnings report on Thursday. In it, Winnebago reported earnings per share (EPS) of $3.51, smashing analyst estimates of $2.26. Furthermore, the company also raked in a total revenue of $1.2 billion for the quarter, marking year-over-year gains of 46%. In the long run, CEO Michael Happe sees “a meaningful runway for further profitable growth” across Winnebago’s portfolio. All things considered, would WGO stock be a top cyclical stock in your books now?

Best Lithium Battery Stocks To Buy Now? 4 To Know
Wells Fargo Inc.
Last but not least, we will be taking a look at Wells Fargo. Overall, most would be familiar with the firm’s work given its position as one of the biggest banks in the U.S. By the bank’s estimates, it currently manages approximately $1.9 trillion in assets across its massive portfolio. Additionally, Wells Fargo also notes that it serves one in three U.S. households and over 10% of small businesses nationwide. Whether it is consumer, commercial, or corporate and investment banking, Wells Fargo is a go-to for many. Likewise, WFC stock could be a go-to for investors given the recovering economy alongside expected interest rate hikes in 2022.
As it stands, shares of WFC stock are up by over 60% year-to-date. Even so, the company continues to find new ways to refine its business. As of earlier this week, Wells Fargo is working with HSBC (NYSE: HSBC) to optimize foreign exchange (FX) transactions. Through a bilateral agreement, the duo are now employing blockchain tech to help make FX actions smoother. How they plan to do this is via a jointly shared settlement ledger to process a wide array of currency exchanges. As such, would you consider WFC stock a top pick in the stock market now?

2021-12-16 00:00:00+00:00,Why Nvidia Stock Dropped Again Today,MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-nvidia-stock-dropped-again-today,,,"What happened
For five long days, it looked like the stock of Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) could do no right, falling steadily day after day. But yesterday, analysts at KeyBanc threw it a lifeline.
KeyBanc noted strong demand for cloud computing services and that sales of Nvidia's semiconductors (which help with cloud computing) seemed to participate in that growth. That caused Nvidia shares to break their five-day losing streak on Wednesday, closing the day 7.5% higher.
But today, the stock is giving back nearly all its gains, and as of 12:45 p.m. ET, it was down 6.1%.
Image source: Getty Images.
So what
Today it's back to the same old story for Nvidia: Analysts are optimistic that the global semiconductor shortage will continue into 2022, and that it will be good news for semiconductor stocks in general. But they still think Nvidia is not the best way to play this trend.
Today, it was J.P. Morgan dissing Nvidia, TheFly.com reported. J.P. Morgan is encouraging investors to look to semiconductor stocks like Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO), Marvell Technology (NASDAQ: MRVL), and KLA (NASDAQ: KLAC) as better bets to play the tight supply chain in the semiconductor industry.
Now what
Broadcom, Marvell, and KLA made J.P. Morgan's list of ""top picks heading into 2022,"" TheFly said, but Nvidia stock was notably absent from this list. That's not a reason to discount Nvidia entirely, because it's not entirely without catalysts. Just today, for example, Nvidia announced that it will give an address at the Consumer Electronics Show on Jan. 4, promising to ""present [its] latest breakthroughs in accelerated computing -- from design and simulation to gaming to autonomous vehicles.""
Something like that might move the needle on Nvidia stock. But the higher this stock's valuation goes, the bigger the news needs to be to move that needle.
With the stock still trading above 93 times earnings despite its recent price weakness, I have to agree with the analysts that companies like KLA, at 22 times earnings; Marvell (23 times earnings), and even Broadcom (at 47) look like better picks for bargain hunters.

2021-12-16 00:00:00+00:00,5 Top Growth Stocks I'm Buying To Kick Off 2022,MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/5-top-growth-stocks-im-buying-to-kick-off-2022,,,"After an incredible showing for growth stocks in 2020 -- in which many names doubled in value or more -- 2021 was unsurprisingly a much tougher go. Lapping massive growth from the first year of the pandemic, companies driving the digital economy forward were due for some pullbacks.
Nevertheless, the stock price is not always reflective of actual business momentum, and 2022 could have much better things in store for growth investors. Here are the top five companies I'm buying to kick off the new year.
Image source: Getty Images.
1. Zoom Video Communications
It's now been well over a year since Zoom Video Communications (NASDAQ: ZM) stock reached its all-time high. As of this writing, shares are down nearly 70% since the autumn of 2020.
If you've been adding to your position on the way down like I have, Zoom has been nothing but a falling knife that continues to cut those that try to catch it. But at this point, trading for just 30 times trailing 12-month free cash flow to enterprise value, Zoom looks like an incredible long-term bargain. The company is still growing sales at a double-digit pace, it's wildly profitable, and it has $5.4 billion in cash and short-term investments and zero debt on its balance sheet.
Cloud-based communications services are still disrupting the status quo in telecom (which is why Twilio is also still one of my favorites), and sooner or later Zoom and peers will reverse course if they can sustain their business momentum.
2. Teladoc Health
Teladoc Health (NYSE: TDOC) has been another fast-growing business whose stock has been in a free fall for the better part of a year. Share prices are also down nearly 70% from the all-time high reached in January 2021.
The pioneer of healthcare delivered via video conferencing and phone has been struck by the pandemic unwind. Though it is still expanding and adding new capabilities to its digital healthcare platform (like last year's acquisition of connected-health-monitoring company Livongo Health), investors have grown glum on Teladoc stock. The mighty Amazon entering the space certainly hasn't helped the mood.
Nevertheless, Teladoc enjoys a first-mover advantage here. Management revealed it thinks it will grow revenue an average of 25% to 30% per year through 2024 as its current addressable market in digital healthcare continues to expand from a base of some $260 billion in annual spending in the U.S. alone. By traditional metrics, Teladoc isn't profitable yet (although it is when using adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization). But if it pulls off its expectations, shares won't keep tumbling forever. I'm adding now to my holdings in this long-term digital-care winner.
3. Block (Square)
The company formerly known as Square recently added another dimension to its branding by changing its name to Block (NYSE: SQ). Investors have been unimpressed. The digital payments industry disruptor has fallen some 37% since the late summer.
Block is a fantastic play on the future of the financial industry. Its payments-solutions segment that helps merchants manage their business in the digital era is still growing at a brisk pace. Inflation expectations for 2022 actually bode well for Block as higher prices mean this toll booth-style operation's fees will rise too (since a fixed percentage of payments are collected from each transaction). Add in Cash App, the consumer-facing business that also allows for Bitcoin and individual stock trading, and this is one fantastic stock to own for the long haul.
Longer-term, Block and peers (like PayPal, another related favorite of mine) should continue to expand if cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology keep picking up steam too. Trading for just 5.5 times trailing 12-month revenue (or just over 11 times 12-month revenue when excluding Bitcoin from the equation), Block stock looks like a timely buy to me right now.
4. Upstart
It's been a while since I've talked about Upstart Holdings (NASDAQ: UPST), but I wasn't really interested in chasing the massive run-up that took place in its share price this past summer. But now that the company has made a roundtrip ending nowhere (shares are down 60% from all-time highs, nearly back to where they were in early August 2021), I'm ready to start buying again.
Like Block, I view Upstart and other fintech businesses, like SoFi Technologies, as the future of the financial services industry. Upstart in particular caught fire this year as its AI software for assessing consumer loans has picked up serious momentum among banks. The company raised full-year guidance every single quarter in 2021. In the third quarter, the company said to expect full-year revenue to be in a range of $798 million to $808 million -- up from about $750 million before. That is an incredible earnings beat and raise but was a more modest upgrade than quarters past, thus helping put a pin in the share-price bubble.
That certainly doesn't mean this growth story is over though. I expect this software firm for banks and lenders to continue expanding for a long time. At about 51 times trailing 12-month free cash flow-to-enterprise value as of this writing, certainly aren't cheap, but Block looks like an ultra-long-term deal as this young tech company is only beginning to crack open the potential of the traditional lending industry.
5. Marvell Technology Group
Up to this point, you might have noticed my top secular growth themes for 2022: Cloud-based communications (Zoom and Teladoc) and financial technology (Block and Upstart). But I want to add one more secular trend to the mix: Semiconductors, a basic building component of not just technology but of nearly every manufactured good in existence.
Chips are the enabler of computing technology, which has reached a point where computing power and affordability have made computing a key ingredient in all sorts of things, from household appliances to cars. They're also the driving force behind cloud computing, which is reshaping how organizations in every sector of the economy operate. This is why I think Marvell Technology Group (NASDAQ: MRVL) is an under-the-radar name that deserves more attention.
After a string of acquisitions, Marvell is a leader in data center and cloud chip design. It's also at the heart of the connected auto movement and is building momentum landing deals among automakers. And of course, there are also 5G mobile networks, which are still early in construction and helping stitch together a lot of the tech movements taking place right now. Marvell designs equipment for all of the above and expects to grow at a robust double-digit percentage pace in 2022.
I like lots of other chip stocks out there too, but I've begun taking a larger stake in Marvell than the small position I started late in 2020. This is the only stock on this list not down big from all-time highs (the company reported a fantastic Q3 financial update), and at 16 times trailing 12-month sales, it isn't cheap either. But with the global chip shortage looking likely to last into 2023, I think Marvell will do well next year.

For the First Trust Lunt U.S. Factor Rotation ETF (Symbol: FCTR), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $38.22 per unit.
With FCTR trading at a recent price near $34.85 per unit, that means that analysts see 9.67% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of FCTR's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are Entegris Inc (Symbol: ENTG), Marvell Technology Inc (Symbol: MRVL), and Cerner Corp. (Symbol: CERN). Although ENTG has traded at a recent price of $142.28/share, the average analyst target is 11.05% higher at $158.00/share. Similarly, MRVL has 10.65% upside from the recent share price of $86.59 if the average analyst target price of $95.81/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting CERN to reach a target price of $84.33/share, which is 9.94% above the recent price of $76.71.

Cerner Corp. CERN $76.71 $84.33 9.94%
Are analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past. These are questions that require further investor research.

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.

2021-12-11 00:00:00+00:00,2 Sizzling Hot Stocks to Buy Right Now,MRVL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/2-sizzling-hot-stocks-to-buy-right-now,,,"Hot stocks can come from companies of all shapes and sizes. For investors, the ride of a hot stock can seem like it's solely dependent on investing when the timing is right. However, there could be many reasons for the stock's run. Sometimes that opportunity is sparked by developments within the market, and other times it could be a matter of a rebound in stock price after a pause during a lengthy climb.
But it's important to not merely act on the noise that looks like growth that is actually unstable in the long run. Investors looking to pad their portfolio with companies that can provide long-term stability and enormous growth potential in burgeoning markets need to look no further than these two sizzling stocks in the midst of a breakout.

1. Marvell Technology
2022 is shaping up to be an excellent year for Marvell Technology (NASDAQ: MRVL). This semiconductor developer and provider of infrastructure semiconductor solutions has a slew of customers made up of original equipment and design manufacturers, such as Apple, Dell, and Time Warner Cable, to name a few. And its total customer portfolio sweeps across a wide swath of markets, ranging from computer hardware to software and programming, to construction, to coal mining.
The stock price has seen a dramatic climb of late, going from $71 on Dec. 2 to over $90 in a period of just one week. Prior to that run-up, the stock had experienced a more gradual but consistent climb, starting at a price of $41 on March 1. That's a 122% gain in just over six months, which may make some investors think they've already missed out on the big gains.
It's true that the gains may be over for the next six to 12 months, but for those looking long-term, there is much to be excited about. The company has a robust partnership ecosystem made up of names like Amazon Web Services, Analog Devices, and Samsung. The partnerships allow for technological collaboration as well as channel distribution, providing it with a full runway into the 5G future as it faces off against a host of competitors.
Marvell is also coming off of a stellar third quarter in which the company's net revenue grew to a record $1.2 billion, a 61% jump for the quarter on a year-over-year basis, along with a gross margin of 48%. Going into the fourth quarter, the company expects continued growth to a projected $1.3 billion for 9% sequential quarterly growth, driven by higher 5G and data center revenue.
The stock has climbed over the past year, but according to analysts, there is still room to run. The average 12-month analyst price target was recently increased from $85 to $100 with a high target of $120. If hit, those targets offer an additional 11% to 33% gain, giving investors one more compelling reason to buy now.
2. Okta
Okta (NASDAQ: OKTA) is a secure identity management application provider that has solutions that work in collaboration with the applications many businesses use on a daily basis. Those applications include big names such as Salesforce, Tableau Software, and Gmail (by Alphabet's Google) to add authentication and authorization services. Similar to Marvell, Okta is a hot stock to buy right now.
After several ups and downs over the past year, Okta stock is currently down 6%. Okta's stock climbed from $26 in 2017 to $220 in July 2020, which was likely its first wave of price appreciation. Although the stock is down, over the course of the past two weeks, it has started showing signs of a second wave, jumping 18%, driven by third-quarter results released on Dec. 2.
The third-quarter revenue grew 61% to $351 million on a year-over-year comparison, with $337 million of that provided by subscription revenue, which grew at a rate of 63%. On top of that, the contracted subscription revenue it expects to recognize over the next 12 months also grew year over year, at a rate of 57%, to a healthy $1.2 billion. The company ended Q3 with $2.5 billion in cash and equivalents.
Those revenue numbers could conceivably grow much higher. As of Oct. 6 of this year, the number of data breaches reported by The Identify Theft Research Center exceeded the total for all of 2020 by 17%. As a result, a growing number of businesses are expected to increase spending on identity security.
Among a crowded field including Microsoft, IBM, and Oracle, Okta was identified by Gartner as the leader in 2021 for identity-as-a-service solutions. Coming off of a quarter in which the company beat consensus estimates on earnings and revenue, this leader is well suited to take advantage of the global identity and access management market that is projected to grow at a compound annual rate of 14.5% through 2025.
