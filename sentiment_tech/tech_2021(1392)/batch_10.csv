2021-10-19 00:00:00+00:00,Intel CEO Wants To Win Back Apple's Business,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intel-ceo-wants-to-win-back-apples-business-2021-10-19,,,"(RTTNews) - Intel Corporation (INTC) recently lost out on a 15-year old partnership with Apple, which used to use Intel chips to power its computers. Now, Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger says he hopes that Intel will be able to make a chipset that is good enough to reclaim the iPhone maker's business. In an interview on HBO, Gelsinger said, ""You know our stumbles, Apple decided they could do a better chip themselves than we could. And, you know, they did a pretty good job,"" referring to Apple's M series chips. ""So what I have to do is create a better chip than they can do themselves. I would hope to win back this piece of their business, as well as many other pieces of business, over time,"" added Gelsinger. Gelsinger, who took over the reins at the company in February, subtly placed the blames on his predecessors for focusing on manufacturing and not on research and development. Apple M1 chip is built on a 5nm architecture, based on ARM's 8-core CPU. On top of that, Apple announced M1 Pro and M1 Max on Tuesday with its MacBooks which claim to be 170% more powerful than the M1. However, Gelsinger is yet to give up on his company to rekindle the relationship with Apple. He said, ""I'd never give up on the idea of anything not running on Intel chips."" To reclaim the summit, Gelsinger's plan is simple, ""I have to make sure that our products are better than theirs, that my ecosystem is more open and vibrant than theirs and we create more compelling reasons for developers and users to land on Intel-based products so I'm going to fight hard to win Tim's business in this area.""

2021-10-19 00:00:00+00:00,Mubadala-backed GlobalFoundries targets valuation of nearly $25 bln in U.S. IPO,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/mubadala-backed-globalfoundries-targets-valuation-of-nearly-%2425-bln-in-u.s.-ipo-2021-10-0,,,"By Anirban Sen
Oct 19 (Reuters) - Chipmaker GlobalFoundries, owned by Abu Dhabi's sovereign wealth fund Mubadala Investment Co, is aiming for a valuation of around $25 billion in its initial public offering in the United States.
In a filing to stock exchanges on Tuesday, GlobalFoundries set a price range between $42 and $47 a share for its stock market flotation. At the upper end of the range, the company is aiming to raise about $2.6 billion.
Reuters was first to report in August that GlobalFoundries had filed for an IPO in New York that could value the company at around $25 billion.
The IPO, one of the most hotly anticipated stock market debuts, is expected to round out a record year for floatations, after several other big names such as Robinhood Markets Inc HOOD.O, Coinbase Global Inc COIN.O and Roblox Corp RBLX.N capitalized on the capital markets boom earlier in 2021.
Alongside electric-vehicle maker Rivian's stock market debut, GlobalFoundries is expected to headline an unusually crowded year-end IPO schedule.
In its latest filing, GlobalFoundries also reported a 56% surge in third-quarter revenue, fueled by worldwide demand for chips.
A shortage of semiconductor chips globally has forced the world's biggest chipmakers to ramp up worldwide production in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic that caused manufacturing delays.
In September, Intel INTC.O Chief Executive Officer Pat Gelsinger said the U.S. company planned to invest up to $95 billion in Europe over the next decade.

HONG KONG (Reuters Breakingviews) - Alibaba offers a promising glimpse into China's chipmaking potential. The $450 billion e-commerce group on Tuesday unveiled a self-developed processor for its fast-growing cloud computing unit. The chip, which will be used to power its own data-centre servers, boasts cutting-edge technology. It's a strategic win if China's top cloud provider is not dependent on U.S. chip designers like Intel. Amazon's AWS debuted its own processor three years ago.
Alibaba is part of a growing cohort of technology companies in the People's Republic venturing further into semiconductors, partly spurred by President Xi Jinping's goal of achieving self-sufficiency in high-tech sectors. In August, search-engine operator Baidu announced it has begun mass production of its artificial intelligence chips, while handset maker Xiaomi is pushing into similar ventures. Alibaba’s efforts will attract the right kind of official scrutiny. (By Robyn Mak)

On average, analysts expect Intel will not see year-over-year revenue growth. Investors should keep an eye on what timeline and schedule are set for Intel's upcoming products like Alder Lake and should note any updates that management might share about the semiconductor shortage.
Snapchat and Netflix are two companies that were considered ""COVID stocks,"" as lockdown restrictions accelerated growth for both. Investors should keep an eye on what type of growth is expected for the upcoming quarters now that restrictions are easing up.

Oct 18 (Reuters) - Apple Inc AAPL.O on Monday kicked off an event oriented around its Mac laptops and music, offering a new subscription level for its Apple Music service for $4.99 a month that uses its Siri voice assistant.
Bloomberg had said Apple planned to release two new MacBook Pro models with 14-inch and 16-inch screens. The Cupertino, California-based company introduced some new laptop models last year that for the first time used its ""Apple Silicon"" chips, which it said would be phased in to the company's desktop and laptop lineup over the course of two years.
Before Monday, Apple's most powerful laptops still relied on chips from Intel Corp INTC.O. The company has already placed a first generation in-house-designed M1 chip into some MacBooks as well as its Mac Mini and iMac desktop machines, but the new larger MacBook Pro models are expected to feature a second, more powerful generation of the company's chip.
The new chip, along with a general rise in laptop sales as employees and students stocked up on tech hardware to work and learn from home, prompted a boom in Mac sales during the pandemic. Revenue rose 11% to $28.6 billion in Apple's fiscal 2020, even as iPhone revenue declined 3%.
The expected MacBook Pro introduction comes weeks after Apple overhauled its iPhone, Apple Watch and iPad lineup.

Shares of the chip giant have underperformed the broader market so far this year despite starting off brightly as cracks in the personal computing and data center businesses have widened on account of stiff competition from the likes of Advanced Micro Devices.
Let's look at what's expected from Intel's upcoming quarterly report and determine whether it could deliver strong enough results and outlook to turn investor sentiment back in its favor.
INTC data by YCharts
Intel needs to tick all the boxes
Intel's second-quarter results, released in July, were better than expected. The company's adjusted earnings of $1.28 per share increased 12% year over year and easily exceeded the Wall Street estimate of $1.06 per share. Its revenue increased 2% over the prior year to $18.5 billion. What's more, Chipzilla had also raised its full-year revenue by $1 billion to $73.5 billion, while bumping up the earnings-per-share guidance by $0.20 to $4.80 per share.
However, these weren't enough to change investor sentiment, as a closer look showed that the competition is proving to be a thorn in the flesh for the chip giant. For instance, the company expects adjusted gross margin of 55% in the third quarter, which would be a significant contraction over the 59.2% reported in Q2. At the same time, Intel's revenue from the data center group fell 9% year over year to $6.5 billion as both shipments and average selling prices fell.

The year-over-year revenue growth of 6% to $10.1 billion from the client computing group was accompanied by a drop in the ASPs of both notebooks and desktop processors. More specifically, notebook ASPs were down 17% over the prior year while desktop ASPs declined 5% -- a result of Intel's strategy to cut prices of its processors in order to move more units.
So Intel needs to not just deliver a solid set of results but also to show that it is regaining its mojo against AMD by cornering more market share. However, Intel's full-year guidance doesn't indicate that's going to be the case. The company's fourth-quarter revenue is expected to drop 8.6% year over year to $18.25 billion, while earnings are expected to contract to $1.01 per share from $1.52 per share a year ago.
For comparison, Intel could put up a much better performance in Q3, with revenue and earnings expected to remain flat year over year. All of this indicates that Intel stock could end up lagging the broader market for the remainder of the year. But investors shouldn't miss the fact that certain silver linings on the horizon could breathe life into the stock in 2022 and beyond.
Chances of a turnaround are on the horizon
Wall Street expects Intel's top-line decline to slow down in 2022, with the company's revenue anticipated to remain flat at 2021 levels. In 2023, analysts expect Intel to regain its mojo with a slight increase in revenue.
YEAR REVENUE ESTIMATE EPS ESTIMATE
2022 $73.2 billion $4.43
2023 $75.8 billion $4.63

However, don't be surprised to see Intel turn its fortunes around faster, as it is all set to step up its game on the product development front. Chipzilla's product roadmap indicates that it will move to a 7-nanometer manufacturing process in the second half of 2022. A smaller node size means that Intel's chips will get more competitive. That's because the transistors in a chip made using a smaller node are more closely packed together, leading to improved performance and higher efficiency.
The company promises a 20% increase in performance per watt over its current-generation chips when it releases processors based on the 7nm process, codenamed Intel 4. Then, in the second half of 2023, Intel plans to bring out an advanced version of its 7nm chips that it claims could be 18% more powerful than the Intel 4 chips. This will be followed by the Intel 20A architecture in 2024 when the company is expected to manufacture chips based on the 5nm node.
All of this indicates that Intel is on track to consistently improve its manufacturing process, which should help it bridge the technology gap with AMD. So Intel can eventually regain its mojo and become a rewarding investment, but investors will have to wait for that turnaround patiently, as it may take some time to arrive. The good part is that patient investors willing to bet on a turnaround at Intel could buy this tech stock at just 12 times trailing earnings, which may prove to be a bargain in the long run once its fortunes start looking up.

Oct 18 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rose on Monday on gains in heavyweight technology companies, although sentiment remained fragile due to slowing economic growth in China and concerns of elevated inflation due to a relentless surge in oil prices.
Eight of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors rose, led by consumer discretionary .SPLRCD and followed by energy .SPNY, which tracked Brent crude oil LCOc1 to its highest since October 2018. O/R
Apple Inc AAPL.O, Google-parent Alphabet GOOGL.O, Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O, Tesla Inc TSLA.O and Facebook Inc FB.O, added between 0.3% and 3% to provide the biggest boost to the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq.
The iPhone maker is expected to unveil new Mac laptop computers with more powerful processor chips at an event later in the day.
However, the global sentiment was dampened by China recording its slowest pace of economic growth in a year in the third quarter, hurt by power shortages and wobbles in the property sector. MKTS/GLOB
""There is some weak data out of China, which is concerning on a global basis, and then market participants came into this earnings with a very pessimistic view but banks dramatically exceeded expectations,"" said Thomas Hayes, managing member at Great Hill Capital Llc in New York.
In the days ahead, investors will keep a close eye on how Corporate America mitigates the impact on earnings from supply chain disruptions, labor shortages and higher costs, especially in the wake of rising oil prices.
Forecast-beating results from big U.S. lenders last week set a positive tone for third-quarter earnings season, with analysts expecting S&P 500 earnings to show a 32% rise from a year ago, according to Refinitiv data.
""The wall of earnings over the next two weeks will be key as to the market's next move; a continuation of the positive commentary should help keep the rally well-supported,"" said Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG.
""Judging by the figures so far it seems like earnings season will be the catalyst for further gains that eluded investors throughout September and early October.""
Johnson & Johnson JNJ.N, insurer Travelers TRV.N, Netflix Inc NFLX.O, Verizon Communications VZ.N, oilfield services cos Baker Hughes Co BKR.N, Schlumberger NV SLB.N, Tesla Inc TSLA.O and Intel Corp INTC.O are some of the companies set to report quarterly results this week.

Walt Disney DIS.N slipped 2.9% after Barclays downgraded the media giant's stock to ""equal weight"" from ""overweight"".
Dynavax Technologies DVAX.O rose 2.6% after French biotech company Valneva SE VLS.PA reported positive results from its late-stage trial of its COVID-19 vaccine candidate VLA2001, using company's CpG 1018 adjuvant.

Namely, the company is converting one of its vehicle component factories in England into an EV component manufacturing plant. In detail, the auto giant plans to have the site manufacturing electric power units by mid-2024. Notably, this $315 million move would mark Ford’s first “in-house investment in all-electric vehicle component manufacturing in Europe”, according to Ford Europe president Stuart Rowley.
Elsewhere, consumer tech names like Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) are actively revving up their offerings for the holiday season. This is evident as the company is expected to reveal the latest iterations of its Macbook devices. All in all, some would argue that growth stocks remain a viable play in the stock market now. On that note, could one of these top growth stocks be worth investing in now?

These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed).

The report noted that among the components of the Nasdaq 100 index, INTC shares displayed both attractive valuation metrics and strong profitability metrics. For example, the recent INTC share price of $54.46 represents a price-to-book ratio of 2.6 and an annual dividend yield of 2.5% — by comparison, the average dividend paying stock in the Nasdaq 100 yields 1.7% and trades at a price-to-book ratio of 8.2. The report also cited the strong quarterly dividend history at Intel Corp, and favorable long-term multi-year growth rates in key fundamental data points.
The report stated, ''Dividend investors approaching investing from a value standpoint are generally most interested in researching the strongest most profitable companies, that also happen to be trading at an attractive valuation. That's what we aim to find using our proprietary DividendRank formula, which ranks the coverage universe based upon our various criteria for both profitability and valuation, to generate a list of the top most 'interesting' stocks, meant for investors as a source of ideas that merit further research.''
The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 index tracks the hundred largest non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq. The exclusion of financials sets the index apart, as does the inclusion of companies that are not US-based (the Dow Jones Industrial Average for instance only covers companies based in the United States).

The current annualized dividend paid by Intel Corp is $1.39/share, currently paid in quarterly installments, and its most recent dividend has an upcoming ex-date of 11/04/2021. Below is a long-term dividend history chart for INTC, which the report stressed as being of key importance. Indeed, studying a company's past dividend history can be of good help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue.

Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) stock has underperformed the market in recent years. INTC stock stock has gone up by only around 20% over the past three years, trailing much behind the PHLX Semiconductor Index‘s return of over 150%. INTC stock currently hovers around $54, up 8% year-to-date (YTD).

Analysts have put the blame on suspended chip upgrades by the company and lack of steps by management to stay ahead of the game. For instance, Intel fell significantly behind TSMC (NYSE:TSM) in the race to develop more advanced chips.
Struggling with R&D, manufacturing, and management issues, Intel has also seen its lead against Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) disappear in the PC and data center central processing unit (CPU) markets. Intel operates in a duopoly with AMD in these markets, currently boasting over 75% of the global x86 CPU market.
Yet, to the excitement of many investors, management has begun setting aggressive targets for Intel. The company is in the process of turning around a large business while competing with formidable competitors. Despite its recent struggles, Intel remains the world’s number one semiconductor company in terms of revenue. Therefore, long-term investors with two- to three-year horizons could consider buying the shares around these levels.
How INTC Stock’s Recent Earnings Came
In fiscal second-quarter 2021, Intel exceeded guidance for revenue, EPS, and gross margin. The chip giant generated $18.5 billion in adjusted revenue, up 2% year-over-year (YoY), outpacing April guidance by $700 million.
Non-GAAP net income came in at $5.2 billion, or $1.28 per diluted share, up from $4.9 billion, or $1.14 per diluted share, in the prior-year quarter. In addition, the company generated $5.7 billion in free cash flow. Cash and equivalents ended the period at $4.75 billion.
7 Growth Stocks That You Should Sell in October
Analysts forecast Intel’s revenue and earnings to decline in 2021 and 2022 as it executes a costly turnaround plan. The top line in 2021 is on track to come in at $73.5 billion compared to 2020’s revenue of $77.9 billion. Adjusted EPS is expected to come in at $4.80.
INTC stock is trading at just 12 times forward earnings and 2.8x trailing sales. Compared to most chip peers, the stock price looks like a bargain based on current earnings. For instance, AMD and TSMC trade at 37 times and 120 times forward earnings, respectively.
The GPU Market
Intel generates most of its revenue from PC and data center CPUs. In recent years, it has taken a significant beating in the CPU market, losing market share to rival AMD in PC processors and servers. AMD’s Zen-based processors currently outperform Intel on essentially every metric. However, Intel is taking steps expects to catch up with AMD’s technological advantage in CPU manufacturing.
The chip giant is also on track to enter the high-end, multibillion-dollar graphics processing unit (GPU) market in 2022 with the launch of its Alchemist GPUs. Intel’s new GPUs are expected to compete with AMD and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA).
Management believes Intel’s GPUs will improve gaming experiences.  In addition to gaming, they are also poised to boost Intel’s market share and pricing power in the laptop space.
Upcoming Foundry Services
Intel has recently partnered with the U.S. Department of Defense to establish a domestic commercial foundry infrastructure. With over 80% of the current manufacturing capacity concentrated in Asia, it makes sense for the government to support Intel in returning the supply chain to the U.S.
The chip giant can become a key player in the foundry market and steal market share from TSMC. However, the cost of entry is massive. Intel’s new CEO, Pat Gelsinger, has highlighted plans to invest $200 billion over the next decade to build Intel Foundry Services (IFS).
In March, Intel declared a $20 billion investment in two new fabs in Arizona to support its products and new foundry business. The company also plans to invest $95 billion in new facilities located in Europe over the next decade.
The foundry industry generated well over $80 billion of revenue in 2020, and that number is poised to surge as more and more devices contain an increasing number of chips. Intel has announced that it has recently enrolled Amazon’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) AWS and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) to its IFS. It may only be a matter of time before other corporations start using Intel’s U.S.- and Europe-based fabs to manufacture their products outside Asia.
The Bottom Line on INTC Stock
Given the growing tensions between the U.S. and China, the global shortage of semiconductor has become a big concern for many industries. Increasing manufacturing capacity in the U.S. and Europe is now a key political priority, increasingly viewed as a national security issue.
Intel currently stands out as the most likely candidate to become a cutting-edge foundry. Yet, it could take at least a few years, and profits are poised to come under pressure due to astronomical spending.
However, if Intel can show signs of progress towards delivering its long-term goals, INTC stock is primed to surge higher. Intel’s current valuation limits its downside potential, making INTC an attractive defensive dividend stock during a market crash. Intel has raised its dividend payment each of the past seven years and currently yields 2.7%. Interested readers could regard the current levels as an opportune entry point.

Oct 18 (Reuters) - Analysts expect Apple Inc AAPL.O to unveil new Mac laptop computers with more powerful processor chips at an event that will be streamed later Monday.
Bloomberg has previously reported that Apple plans to release two new MacBook Pro models with 14-inch and 16-inch screens. The Cupertino, California-based company introduced some new laptop models last year that for the first time used its ""Apple Silicon"" chips, which it said would be phased into the company's desktop and laptop lineup over the course of two years.
Before Monday, Apple's most powerful laptops still relied on chips from Intel Corp INTC.O. The company has already placed a first generation in-house-designed M1 chip into some MacBooks as well as its Mac Mini and iMac desktop machines, but the new larger MacBook Pro models are expected to feature a second, more powerful generation of the company's chip.
The new chip, along with a general rise in laptop sales as employees and students stocked up on tech hardware to work and learn from home, prompted a boom in Mac sales during the pandemic. Revenue rose 11% to $28.6 billion in Apple's fiscal 2020, even as iPhone revenue declined 3%.
The expected MacBook Pro introduction comes weeks after Apple overhauled its iPhone, Apple Watch and iPad lineup.
Some analysts believe Apple on Monday will also update its AirPods wireless ear buds, though rumors of an update have circulated ahead of other Apple events this year without coming to pass. Add-on devices like AirPods tend to be large sellers during holiday shopping seasons and have become one of Apple's fastest-growing categories, with its home and accessories segment growing 25% to $30.6 billion in Apple's fiscal 2020.

hanks to strong earnings results from several blue-chip companies and banks, the stock market has regained levels near record highs. But despite strong September retail sales and the strong start to third-quarter earnings, there’s still some concern about flagging consumer sentiment.
Evidenced by Friday’s strong close for the Dow Jones Industrial Average which reclaimed the 35,000 threshold, investors are seemingly feeling more confident that the upcoming earnings results from the most influential companies in the S&P 500 will be supportive of higher valuations. The results received so far have been encouraging. But investors are looking for more supportive reasons to anticipate a sustained rebound in the third and fourth quarters.
We continue to talk about the importance of not only the upcoming corporate earnings, but also the implication of the guidance that will be provided. So far, both have come in above expectations. The Dow on Friday Dow rose 382.20 points to close at 35,294.76, gaining 1.09%. The Blue Chip index was driven by increases in Apple (AAPL), Qualcomm (QCOM), IBM (IBM), Microsoft (MSFT) and Intel (INTC), which offset declines in McDonald’s (MCD) and Walgreens (WBA).
The S&P 500 index closed 33.11 points higher to 4,471.37, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index added 73.91 points, gaining 0.50% to close at 14,897.34. Aside from the aforementioned Apple and Microsoft, Nasdaq’s rally was driven by gains in, among others, Tesla (TSLA), Alphabet (GOOG , GOOGL) and Amazon (AMZN). Part of the bullishness also stemmed from the report on September retail sales data that showed a rise of 0.7%, higher than the 0.2% decline that was forecasted. This number suggests that Americans are spending at a level that can sustain an economic recovery from the pandemic. This is even as consumers are paying more to do so due to the rise in inflation.
For the week, the Nasdaq was the biggest winner, rising about 2.2%. The S&P 500 climbed 2%, while the Dow added 1.1%. This was a stunning turnaround after what has been a tumultuous few weeks, sparked by concerns over global growth and rising bond yields. From Tuesday through Friday it was clear that “buying the dip” remains the working strategy for investors who have the patience to ride the cycle. The main question heading into the week is whether this rally can continue, particularly as Big Tech comes into focus.
As far as earnings go, here are the stocks to keep an eye on this week.
Netflix (NFLX) - Reports after the close, Tuesday, Oct. 19
Wall Street expects Netflix to earn $2.56 per share on revenue of $7.48 billion. This compares to the year-ago quarter when earnings were $1.74 per share on $6.38 billion in revenue.
What to watch: Shares of Netflix have gone on an impressive run, rising some 10% over the past month, driven by bullish commentary from analysts about the company’s slate of programming and growth potential. With 209 million paid subscribers, Netflix is by far the industry’s king of streaming. But will it stay that way? With the emergence of rival streamers such as Disney+ (DIS), HBO Max (T) and Apple TV+ (AAPL), the industry has gotten crowded. And it’s poised to be more even crowded in the next few years given the rate at which media companies are creating content for their own streaming platforms. Despite this, Netflix has figured out ways to maintain its status. And it appears Wall Street believes this is sustainable. Last week, citing the company’s international penetration and increased subscriber growth, analysts at Truist raised the price target to $690 from $600. The analysts noted Netflix’s recent strong content, such as “Squid Game,” which became a global phenomenon. Nonetheless, Netflix stock is not cheap anymore. On Tuesday the management team will need to guide in a bullish manner to keep the momentum.
IBM (IBM) - Reports after the close, Wednesday, Oct. 20
Wall Street expects IBM to earn $2.50 per share on revenue of $17.77 billion. This compares to the year-ago quarter when earning were $2.58 per share on $17.72 billion in revenue.
What to watch: IBM has always been a great stock to buy for dividend investors, but has the company become more appealing to growth investors as well? The tech giant has struggled to grow revenues over the past decade and has not benefited in the massive economic expansion that saw cloud leaders such as Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT) produce double-digit revenue gains. But as it transitions away from its legacy businesses, IBM’s turnaround has seemingly begun. The company’s cloud ambitions have shown some promise in recent quarters and has provided ample revenue strength to support a higher multiple, thanks to the Red Hat acquisition which modernized its cloud business. The company is now forecasted to grow revenues by high single digits annually over the next 5 years. The stock has rallied from about $115 back in January to over $150. While there is some near-term resistance, it appears the market is giving IBM more credit for the recent traction the company has made towards the cloud. But for the the shares to maintain their uptrend, the company will need to demonstrate continued operating leverage and revenue growth acceleration.
Tesla (TSLA) - Reports after the close, Wednesday, Oct. 20
Wall Street expects Tesla to earn $1.50 per share on revenue of $13.5 billion. This compares to the year-ago quarter when earnings came to 76 cents per share on revenue of $8.77 billion.
What to watch: Tesla shares have skyrocketed as much as 50% in the past five months, rising from around $555 in May to a recent high of $835. While the stock is still about 10% below is 52-week high of $900, that rate of volatility is par for the course for Tesla. Investors want to know how much higher the stock can go. Some of the recent bullishness stems from the fact that Tesla just reported its highest vehicle sales in China in two years. Last week Tesla announced it sold 56,006 China-made vehicles in September, marking a 25.5% increase from August's sales of 44,264 vehicles. The rise in vehicle sales maintains the strong trend which included record global vehicle deliveries of 241,300 in the third quarter. Investors are eager to learn how much profits this growth has produced. Updates on Semi and the Cybertruck timelines, as well as building progress for Texas plant and the one being built in Germany, will also determine the speed at which Tesla stock can drive higher from here.
Intel (INTC) - Reports after the close, Thursday, Oct. 21
Wall Street expects Intel to earn $1.11 per share on revenue of $18.24 billion. This compares to the year-ago quarter when earnings were $1.11 per share on revenue of $18.33 billion.
What to watch: Which version of Intel will the market see on Thursday? Shares of the chip giant has fallen 16% over the past six months, compared to 7% rise in the S&P 500 index. The stock is down about 15% since the company reported its Q1 results in April. And its Q2 results, reported in July, did little to excite investors about the long-term growth prospects. While Intel has surpassed the Street’s revenue estimates in ten straight quarters, investors have grown frustrated about the company’s lack of progress in key business segments, particularly the datacenter group and client computing group which accounts for a respective 30% and 50% of the company’s quarterly revenue. Weaknesses in these areas for Intel have been magnified by the successes and market share gains from rivals AMD (AMD) and Nvidia (NVDA) in several important chip developments. While CEO Pat Gelsinger has done a decent job changing the negative narrative surrounding the company, Intel on Thursday must prove the naysayers wrong, while selling the upside potential of the many growth initiatives it can still achieve.

Nicholas Rossolillo: I like your chart actually, Jason, you want to throw that out there again?
Jason Hall: I will.
Rossolillo: The Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), Nvidia, Taiwan Semi (NYSE: TSM) chart. Nvidia is my favorite chip stock, has been for a really long time. It remains my favorite, even though it is expensive, should we do quotation marks, ""expensive."" I think it's important to understand how the semiconductor industry works, to understand why that is, because it's not just that Nvidia is growing and gobbling up market share against Intel. Intel has to open up that architecture because Nvidia is gunning for them, they're trying to overtake Intel on that department.
But the chip industry. You've got like an engineering firm. Basically, they're just electrical engineers. They design circuitry. Then companies that design circuitry license out that technology to a manufacturing partner. That's the second phase, manufacturing, that's where your Taiwan Semiconductor comes into play, who has now overtaken Intel in that department as the world's largest chip fab. Nvidia has this really interesting layer on top of that. They're not a manufacturer. They only design stuff, they're an engineering firm, but they're also a software company.
Hall: Right.
Rossolillo: To a certain extent, all chip companies have to be software companies, too, because you need to have on a very basic level, at least some very basic software embedded in the chip so that when you plug it in somewhere, the electricity knows what to do. The computer, the chip knows what to do when it's turned on, and then a software developer can build layers of software on top of that to do higher-order tasks. Nvidia has gone way beyond that now. Just that basic firmware embedded in the chip. They're now licensing out software built on their hardware, as a software-as-a-service company.
Hall: That's incredible.
Rossolillo: Which we know here at the Fool is a huge industry with hundreds of billions of dollars a year and growing. Nvidia, they're not dabbling in that space now. They have a huge business in that space. They're licensing out some incredibly powerful software built on their incredibly powerful hardware that has gotten them to this point. I don't think that's going to be a hard thing to achieve from the industry, not at the chip industry level and at the software level, too, Nvidia makes a really compelling case when they go out to customers with that pre-packaged hardware and software bundle. It's just such a compelling value proposition. That's why Nvidia gets the really high price tag. Now, is it a best buy today? I don't know. But over the next 10 years, I just have a hard time imagining Nvidia losing too much steam for too long.
Hall: I think that's the key. Sometimes, we make investing too hard. The thing that Taiwan Semi has going for it is so many tailwinds. The need for all of the stuff that all of these companies do is not going to get any smaller. We're at a point right now, as we all know, if you've tried to buy a car or a dishwasher or a laptop or anything, anything short of a blanket, you get to wait. You get in line of wait behind everybody else because we're at capacity.

Stuck in a trading range for months, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) stock is not standing still.
Source: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com
The chip giant is fending off competitive pressures from Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) by cutting prices. This will help INTC gain back some market share temporarily. It will need to do more to sustain its consistent dividend and to return to growth.
In April, Intel launched a 10-nanometer data center computer chip. this is a third-generation Intel Xeon Scalable processor, called Ice Lake. The chip will give artificial intelligence, high-performance computing, cloud and networking workloads a performance increase. The Intel CPU will have 40 cores, eight channels of memory per socket, and as many as 64 lanes of PCIe per socket. The specifications will impress Intel’s customers.
By moving to PCIe Gen4, the system will provide a doubling in bandwidth. Furthermore, the interconnect rates will increase by around 7.7%.
Despite the refresh, Intel may not offer enough. AMD’s EPYC 7002 processors have up to 64 cores and 128 threads. The AMD server chip has 128 PCIe 4.0 lanes, too.
7 Best Bargain Stocks to Buy in October
To gain back market share, Intel must lower prices for its server chips while AMD suffers from a server CPU shortage. In the first quarter, AMD could not take advantage of its technical lead due to a supply shortage. It launched EPYC 3 server processors in March. Customers include Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Azure, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Web Services and Alphabet’s (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google Cloud.
Product Refresh
Intel plans to ramp up CPU volumes for its next-generation Eagle Stream platform. This will probably happen in the second quarter of 2022. But by then, AMD could reach a 15% server market share. By then, AMD will launch EPYC Zen 4, code-named Geno. This chip will have up to 96 cores and 12-channel DDR5 memory.
In the self-driving market, Intel will team up with Sixt SE, a German mobility services company. Through Intel’s Mobileye unit, the companies will start offering a driverless robotaxi service in Munich starting in 2022. Mobileye is usually quiet about its self-driving system. This time, it is publicly announcing Mobileye Drive to showcase its fully integrated self-driving system.
Intel’s Mobileye has a large addressable market for self-driving systems. For example, driverless ride-hailing services and commercial customers will implement Mobileye’s system. After it tests robotaxis in Munich next year, it will move to commercial operations after getting government regulatory approval.
Capacity Expansion
Instead of relying on third parties for chip production, Intel will expand its capacity. It will build new chip-making facilities in Europe. This will cost up to $95 billion. Intel Chief Executive Officer Pat Gelsinger said:
This new era of sustained demand for semiconductors needs bold, big thinking.
The chip shortage is unlikely to ease soon. By increasing its capital investments for two chip factories in Europe, Intel will take on companies like Samsung and Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM). The price tag sounds high, but European governments may offer generous tax breaks and subsidies to help pay for the expansion plans.
The chip volume per automobile is rising steadily. In the next decade, Intel will expand its profit margins for chips used in vehicles and computers.
Opportunity
Special purpose acquisition companies like Ouster (NASDAQ:OUST) and Velodyne Lidar (NASDAQ:VLDR) cashed in on the autonomous vehicle craze in the last year. Ambarella (NASDAQ:AMBA) broke out to highs recently, too. Yet Intel’s Mobileye unit gets no recognition for its future contribution to Intel’s bottom line.
Investors may start a position in the beat-up chip giant. INTC stock trades at considerably lower valuations compared to AMD. Its price-earnings ratio is around 12. AMD’s stock price trades at a premium at around 40x earnings. Graphics card supplier Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) trades at almost twice that of AMD stock.
Chances are good that value investors will flock back to Intel stock in the next few months. They will seek chip companies that are spending more to expand their capital. Intel offers a low-risk exposure for technology investors.
Fair Value
Source: Stock Rover
Intel stock scores well on value and quality.
Investors get a cheap stock in return for mediocre growth. Intel’s growth prospects improve as it rolls out new chips. Margins will expand in the next few years as it manufactures computer chips in-house. Conversely, fabless competitors rely on a third party. They risk supply shortages. Margin pressures are another risk if the supply demands better terms.
Your Takeaway on INTC Stock
Intel is a good long-term investment. When the technology index is valued at all-time highs, dependent on temporarily low interest rates, INTC stock will withstand a market sell-off.

*Stock Advisor returns as of September 17, 2021
Nicholas Rossolillo: what's your favorite chip stock in the semiconductor sector?
Jason Hall: Jeremy, you want to hit this one?
Jeremy Bowman: Yeah, I'll hit this one first. My pick is going to be ACM Research. It's ticker ACM. I own a bit of the stock. I think this a pretty off-the-radar company for most people. It's a manufacturer of semiconductor wafer cleaning machines.
Hall: Everybody has got one of those in their kitchen, Jeremy.
Bowman: Sure. [laughs] Right?
Hall: There we go. That's awesome. Keep going. I love it when we get these are very esoteric companies like this. Keep going.
Bowman: These machines are about $2 million to $5 million, so Jason, you probably have a few of them in your garage. That's something over there.
Hall: I have a very nice kitchen.
Bowman: [laughs] This is an essential tool or essential process for semiconductors. I'd look at it as a picks-and-shovels play in the industry. It's an American company but they do their business in China, which is where a lot of the chip manufacturing takes place. I think they are more insulated from the stuff that's, regulatory crackdown on those concerns going on in China. If you wanted some exposure to the Chinese market, but want the protection of a U.S. company, they can do that for you. They are growing pretty solidly. I think in the 25%-30% range. They're also profitable, so they got the components of the growth stock. I'll see if I can share the YCharts with you just to tell that story. Let's pull this up.
Hall: There we go.
Bowman: Yeah, most recent quarter we got 30% revenue growth. Profit margin has been 12%, pretty solidly in the double-digits last year. Stock really took off early in the pandemic. Their customers are some of the biggest semiconductor manufacturers in China. I like the pick-and-shovels idea. I think the numbers are good, so I think it's got a lot of things you want in most stocks. I also think chip prices are going up so that's going to favor all the industry players and it's going to increase demand, the shortage isn't good, I guess, but the long-term, we need more chips. Demand is going up and this is top-of-the-line cleaning proprietary technology that they're providing. I think demand for their services should increase as well.
Hall: I think people don't realize, Jeremy, how incredibly complex semiconductor manufacturing is and how these facilities have to be as spotless as anything can possibly be to be able to develop. What's the saying in the industry? It's not rocket science, it's harder. [laughs] It's actually incredible.
Bowman: The defects we're talking about, chips are small to begin with, and then these are taking care of defects that are nanometers, they're measured and they're infinitesimal.
Hall: It's incredible. Nick, I'm going to go second here and let you bring it home last. This is one that's not my favorite per se. But I think it's just gotten to a point, guys, where I think Intel is undervalued and overlooked. In fairness, this is a company that's gotten in their own way for a while. Tried with fits and starts to do things differently and nothing really ever worked. Let's take Intel and put it in the bucket of what it is, so it's fully integrated. This is a company, they've designed, they have their own proprietary architecture. They design on it and they manufacture it, they do it right soup to nuts.
They work with different customers for optimization, customization, that stuff. But it's not like any of these other fabless chip manufacturers where they design and then they go to a third party that does the manufacturing. There's this massive market, there's this massive opportunity, and I think it's probably obvious that this is where most of the growth is and that's where companies want to design their own chips. They want to make them to do the things that they need them to be able to do. Yes, Intel's architecture is always going to have a lot of customers that just want to buy it. They're going to want to buy what Intel makes. They're writing software for that architecture, or their customers are using software that's built for that architecture, and that's going to be the case.
But they've been ignoring this massive opportunity. But I think Pat Gelsinger, their new CEO, I think he is on the right track. I think he has a plan and if he holds true with this plan, I think this is a great turnaround opportunity. I'm going to share a screen here and I'm just going to show some valuations just to set the stage. What we have here, this is Intel's price in purple, it's around $54 a share right now. I'm going to pull the price off just so it's easier to see on price-to-earnings and price-to-cash flows basis where the stocks trades and this is over the past 10 years. This is looking way back. I think at the very least, this is fair value and it's probably cheap if they just do an OK job of building new capacity and opening up their X86 architecture to more companies to develop chips that they want versus buying what Intel says they want. I think it's really important and I think they can do that.
Just to set the stage just as a comparison, some companies that are loved here at the Fool and that are great companies, I just want to show some comparative metrics. Price-to-cash flows, Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) almost 67 times trailing operating cash flow and Taiwan Semi (NYSE: TSM) trades for about 19 times trailing operating cash flow. Now, for good reason. They trade for these valuations because these businesses have absolutely nailed it and they execute well and they are dominant in what they do and Intel hasn't done well and has ceded market share. But I think I believe in Pat Gelsinger, I believe in what he's trying to do, and right now, paying less than seven times cash flows, I think Intel over the next five to 10 years, because this is not going to turn around in a year, it's not going to turn around in two years, over the next five to 10 years, I think it's going to beat the market. I really do, guys. Nick.
Rossolillo: I like it. You guys took like two opposite approaches to this, too.
Hall: Very much so.
Rossolillo: Jeremy, very niche small company, Jason, arguably the most recognizable semiconductor name on the planet.

10 stocks we like better than Nvidia

*Stock Advisor returns as of September 17, 2021
Toby Bordelon: Let's get started with a company I'm sure many know, many may own Nvidia. We all know what they do. Make graphics cards, make chips, all that stuff. The big news for Nvidia, I think is the Arm deal. This deal was originally announced in September of last year, 2020. Almost a year ago. Nvidia is buying Arm. In theory; that may be a little bit of trouble right now, a few weeks ago, Nvidia admitted that their original 18-month timeline is unlikely at this point.
The deal was supposed to close by March 2022. That's probably not going to happen at this point based on what we know. U.K. regulators are reviewing the deal. They say they have some security concerns. I think they might be less national security concerns and more political concerns. They don't really want potentially a U.S. company owning Arm. Arm is based in the U.K. That's why they are dealing with this, right now owned by SoftBank though, which is a Japanese conglomerate.
Their rationale doesn't ring true when you really look at the alternative. There are also maybe concerns with China regulators. Nvidia just recently submitted the application to China regulators in June, eight months after the deal was announced and China is making noise that they're not going to be rushed. They're going to take their time reviewing this deal. The timeline is at risk and this deal might not even get done. There is a potential that it doesn't actually happen, regulators don't approve it.
But what's the alternative? You look at other companies that could buy Arm and they all probably have even bigger issues than Nvidia does thinking, Apple, Samsung, Qualcomm, Intel, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Microsoft doesn't even make sense. But all of these other potential buyers have just as big, if not more regulatory issues, especially antitrust issues to getting this deal done than Nvidia does.
I think Nvidia's consolation prize, if the deal doesn't close, that no one else gets them, at least. But I think Nvidia is going to be fine either way. It'd be nice if they had Arm, but don't think that if this doesn't close, suddenly, this is a bad investment. We'll have to see what happens. But at a minimum, it's going to take longer than we thought.
Matt Frankel: Nvidia's become a really big company over the years. I sure do wish I would've bought shares about five or six years ago. But do you see Nvidia as having become too big to really deliver market-beating performance over the long term?
Bordelon: That's a good question. It's a $500 billion company. I think it's definitely getting up there. Is it capable of market-beating returns? I think for sure. Look at Apple, Amazon, Microsoft. Big companies can give us market-beating returns. But I think when you look at these big companies, like the large companies that give you market beating returns, that's an elite group.
I'm not sure Nvidia is quite ready to join that group yet. I do want to show you this real quick. This is part of the slide presentation they did for the Arm deal. Part of the rationale for that is their investment in R&D. You look at this chart here on the left, Nvidia's R&D as a percentage of their revenue compared to what other companies are doing. That tells you that as much as they are putting on R&D, yeah, they could potentially give you market beating returns because they are seriously investing in their business even at this size.
But it's going to be a struggle and I just don't think you should expect the small-cap SaaS returns we've seen from some other companies in the past couple of years.

The global chip shortage is forcing Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to cut iPhone production by as many as 10 million units, according to Bloomberg. The AAPL stock price is down 5.8% in the last month.

That means it’s time for you to buy Apple stock. A 10 million unit cut would amount to about 5%, based on past years’ sales. Production was estimated at 218 million units as recently as 2018. It’s not a huge cut.
It’s also likely temporary. Before you look to buy some rival phone maker, note that Apple gets two-thirds of the industry’s profit. The production cut, assuming it happens, just means some people will wait for their phones, and pay premium prices for them.
Tight Ecosystem Fuels AAPL Stock
Apple has always used a closed, proprietary business model. This has been the case since the 1970s and the Apple II. It lost the PC market in the 1980s because it couldn’t keep up with demand, the way the OEMs around Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) could. I was covering the industry at the time. While the Macintosh was a superior product, customers waited five years for a PC with a graphical user interface that worked.
What changed the equation in the 21st century was China. China could produce as many iPods, then iPhones, as Apple could sell. Apple’s price still gives it just 14-16% of the global market, but it has half the U.S. market. That’s where the profits lie.
5 Triple A-Rated Stocks to Buy for October
Apple’s control over its ecosystem is behind its profitability. Companies selling phones based on Alphabet’s (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Android go through distribution channels. Apple has full control over its channel, and resellers don’t undercut its pricing. Then there are services like the App store, which represented 21% of revenue in the most recent quarter. That’s nearly all profit. Apple is regularly able to take about one-third of its revenue to the net income line.
Missing the Boat
Apple shares have been under pressure since the unofficial end of the summer. So has the rest of the tech sector. Shares are down 10.1% since Labor Day while the sector, using a proxy of the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEArca:XLK), is down 5%. AAPL stock is likely to go lower in the near term.
But as CNBC analyst Jim Cramer points out, that’s a buying opportunity. Great companies like Apple seldom go on sale, and they don’t stay on sale long. Selling now is likely to mean missing the turn.
The turn could come as early as next week. Apple has a Macintosh event scheduled for October 18. Apple is boosting its profit margins on the Mac line by switching from Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) chips to silicon it designs. By designing its own silicon Apple can also unify the PC and phone product lines, one operating system to rule both the desktop and the mobile markets.
But what Apple bears are hanging their arguments on has nothing to do with what’s going on in Cupertino. It’s more about rising interest rates, which creates competition for investor money.
A better argument might be found in the U.S. government and its antitrust push. Apple won most of the argument in its suit with Epic Games. But the suit did open new arguments for both the government and future litigants.
The Bottom Line
During my 43-year journalism career I have watched many tech companies fail, not just those in competitive markets but in dominant positions.
When I began my life as a reporter, IBM dominated the market. Apple itself had big problems through the first half of the 1990s, until the late Steve Jobs returned it to glory. Microsoft stock went nowhere for a decade while it was under a Justice Department consent decree.
Leaders fail when they stop focusing on the market and turn their attention inward. It’s office politics that kills them. It could happen when CEO Tim Cook retires and a battle for control erupts.
But it’s not going to happen over a supply chain glitch. Only watch today’s headlines if you don’t own Apple.
