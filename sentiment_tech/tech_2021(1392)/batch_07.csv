2021-11-04 00:00:00+00:00,3 Dividend Stocks to Buy Hand Over Fist,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-dividend-stocks-to-buy-hand-over-fist-2021-11-04,,,"As investment options go, dividend-paying stocks can be hard to beat. They tend to offer fairly dependable income, usually arriving quarter after quarter, no matter what the overall economy is doing. On top of that, income from these investments will tend to increase over time, as companies hike their payouts. Also attractive to investors are undervalued stocks, as they also offer the likelihood of price appreciation -- with a margin of safety.
Better still are appealing dividend-paying companies that find themselves undervalued at a given time. Here are three you might want to consider for insertion into your portfolio.

1. Lockheed Martin
With a market value recently topping $90 billion and more than 110,000 employees, Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT) is a major defense company, specializing in the security and aerospace realms. It raked in more than $65 billion in 2020 (about 74% of which came from the U.S. government), generated some $8 billion in cash flow from operations and $6.8 billion in net earnings, and recently sported a backlog of orders valued at $147 billion. The stock price was recently down more than 16% from its 52-week high, in part due to slowing sales. That is a bummer, but the company has multiple irons in the fire, such as hypersonic missiles, which have real potential to boost revenue in the future.
Lockheed Martin's stock seems appealingly priced, with a recent price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 15.3, well below its five-year average of 22.5. Its dividend is appealing, too, recently yielding 3.4% and increasing at an annual average rate of 9.5% over the past five years. Its payout ratio of about 48% is a plus, too: Payout ratios reflect the percentage of earnings being paid out in dividend form, and 48% is a level that suggests there's still plenty of room for dividend growth. The company is also planning to reward shareholders with stock buybacks that will boost the value of remaining shares. Buybacks also happen to be a smart move when a stock is undervalued.
2. Omnicom
Omnicom (NYSE: OMC) may not be a household name, but it's the world's second-largest advertising company by revenue, recently boasting a market value topping $14 billion. It describes itself as more than that, as ""the world's largest media network with more than 12,000 people working in over 100 countries."" Advertising accounts for a bit more than half of Omnicom's revenue, with customer relationship management products and services making up much of the rest.
In the company's third quarter, it posted year-over-year revenue growth of 7.1% and net income growth of 13.5%. CEO John Wren noted on the accompanying conference call, ""As we head into the fourth quarter, we are well-positioned competitively and expect to benefit as economic growth continues to improve globally and from ongoing cost management."" Some are wondering lately if that's a bit optimistic, as the global supply chain issues may depress advertising spending, with many companies having less to sell.
Omnicom's stock recently sported a P/E ratio of 10.6, well below its five-year average of 14.3, suggesting that it's significantly undervalued. The company's dividend recently offered a fat yield of 4.1%, and that payout has been increasing at an annual rate of 4.9% over the past five years.

3. Intel
You may have heard of the chip shortage that's causing all kinds of problems for American consumers. Well, it's causing problems for chipmakers such as Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), too. It's having trouble keeping up with demand, which grew faster than expected in part due to people working from home during the pandemic and buying laptops, etc.
The company had already been struggling, facing competition from fellow semiconductor specialists Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, AMD, and Samsung while delaying the release of newer, faster chips. It has a new CEO now, Pat Gelsinger, and he's busy building new manufacturing plants and working to expand production capacity. The U.S. government has also earmarked tens of billions of dollars to help spur chip production. These factors suggest a promising future for Intel, though it might take a while to get there.
In the meantime, though, the stock pays a dividend that recently yielded 2.8%, and that payout has grown at an annual rate of 6% over the past five years. And Intel's stock recently sported a P/E ratio of 9.5, well below its five-year average of 14.3, suggesting that it's significantly undervalued.
Worth a closer look
These are just some of many intriguing stocks out there that are both seemingly undervalued and also offering solid dividend yields. Take a closer look at any that interest you.

2021-11-03 00:00:00+00:00,Why Shares of Super Micro Computer Raced 13% Higher This Morning,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-shares-of-super-micro-computer-raced-13-higher-this-morning-2021-11-03,,,"What happened
Shares of Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI) were up 13% today as of 12:35 p.m. EDT. The data center and server hardware supplier that bills itself as an energy efficient technologist reported earnings for its first quarter of fiscal 2022 (the three months ended Sept. 30). Revenue and earnings per share (EPS) both easily surpassed what the average Wall Street analyst was expecting.
Specifically, sales were up 35% year over year to $1.03 billion, and adjusted earnings per share were up 5% to $0.58.
Image source: Getty Images.
So what
Demand for computing hardware is on the rise among large enterprises. With cloud computing quickly becoming the norm for IT operations, an upgrade cycle in data centers is under way. Super Micro is benefiting from this trend, and its efficient electronic equipment can help its customers cut down on energy consumption and carbon emissions. The company has a long-term goal of reaching $10 billion in annualized revenue as this massive corporate migration to the cloud plays out over the next decade.
With surging demand and a global chip shortage that is extending sales lead times, the current pace of Super Micro's growth is expected to continue for the foreseeable future. Management expects full-year fiscal 2022 revenue to be as much as $4.6 billion, a 29% increase over last year at the high end of guidance.
Now what
Super Micro had a great quarter, but a few things bear considering before piling into this stock. Super Micro -- which relies on semiconductor and other electronic component designers like Intel, Advanced Micro Devices, and Nvidia as key partners -- is a historically low-margin business. Gross profit margin was a meager 13% during the last quarter in spite of booming sales. The company has steadily grown its business over the years, but IT hardware sales are cyclical in nature, and Supermicro's profitability has remained thin at best even as it has expanded.
Nevertheless, with the stock trading at a respective 20 and 35 times trailing-12-month earnings per share and free cash flow, this stock might pique the interest of some value investors.

2021-11-03 00:00:00+00:00,Why Advanced Micro Devices Stock Is a Buy After Earnings,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-advanced-micro-devices-stock-is-a-buy-after-earnings-2021-11-03,,,"Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) is looking strong after reporting its fifth straight quarter of 50%-plus growth in Q3. Momentum was once again broad across the business, with notable strength in data centers and gaming.
While the stock is trading at a lofty price-to-earnings ratio of 46 based on 2021 earnings estimates, the stock still surged to new highs following earnings last week, which might indicate that the shares still have legs. The long-term opportunity in serving the growing need for data centers is certainly on investors' radar, but gaming remains a top near-term catalyst that investors shouldn't overlook.

AMD Ryzen CPUs are outperforming Intel
AMD reports sales of its Instinct data center graphics processing units (GPUs) and consumer central processing units (CPUs) in the computing and graphics segment, which grew 44% year over year and 7% sequentially to $2.4 billion last quarter.
The Ryzen 5000 series CPUs continue to dominate the consumer side of the market. Ryzen chips are based on AMD's Zen 3 chip architecture and score higher benchmark scores compared to Intel's (NASDAQ: INTC) high-end Rocket Lake and Comet Lake chips. A recent review by Tom's Hardware noted that the Ryzen 5000 series beat Intel ""in every metric that matters,"" such as running games, power consumption, and application-specific performance.
Intel is looking to counter AMD with its upcoming Alder Lake chips, but Chipzilla might be stuck playing catch-up. After all, Intel's previous Rocket Lake chips didn't stop AMD's growth. While Alder Lake may temporarily narrow the gap, AMD could come out on top again with its Ryzen 6000 CPUs next year. The 6000 series will feature the new 3D V-Cache, which is expected to boost data retrieval speeds and deliver another leap in gaming performance.
The way things are going now, AMD's recent market share gains against Intel in the x86 CPU market are showing signs of sticking, which is good news for investors.
As for GPUs, revenue more than doubled year over year, which management attributed to higher shipments for CDNA 2 data center chips and strong demand for the Radeon 6000 series designed for gaming.
Some investors may have been a bit concerned in recent months that both AMD and Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) surging growth in gaming GPUs might have been inflated by higher sales going to cryptocurrency miners. Given the unpredictable nature of crypto mining demand, both companies would like to keep their consumer GPUs going to their intended use cases, which is gaming. On that note, AMD CEO Lisa Su eased those concerns during the Q3earnings callby stating that demand from the crypto-mining community was ""negligible"" during the quarter.
Consoles and cloud gaming opportunities
There are still big opportunities over the next few years to sell more chips in the console and cloud gaming markets.
We're just one year into the launch of Sony's PlayStation 5 and Microsoft's Xbox Series X/S, so AMD still has some room to grow its semi-custom business. AMD reported a 69% year-over-year increase in revenue to reach $1.9 billion in the enterprise, embedded, and semi-custom segment, which includes sales of the custom processors used in the new consoles. Console sales usually don't peak until the fourth year after launch, so AMD should continue to see healthy demand here.
Moreover, Nvidia just unveiled its new GeForce NOW RTX 3080 membership, which is powered by AMD Threadripper PRO CPUs. The success of GeForce NOW is another catalyst for AMD's gaming business.
Overall, management expects growth across the business in the fourth quarter. Guidance calls for revenue growth of 39% year over year. Given the momentum in gaming, on top of the secular demand trends in data centers, AMD looks like a growth tech stock that could still deliver robust returns for investors -- even at a P/E of 46.

Jason Hall: I'm going to go with another kind of legacy company that's a big player in its space. This one is very much a turnaround story, but that's Intel, ticker INTC. There's a couple of reasons that I've gotten really, really interested in Intel and I bought a position actually on Oct. 1. The semiconductor industry is hugely important as if you've tried to buy anything that either has a battery or plugs into the wall for electricity, there is no more industry, it's like the central point of failure for the entire global supply chain right now. It's so important. The proliferation of semiconductors is continuing. They're becoming more complex, they're needed in more and more things, they need to be more secure, they need to be more reliable, they need to be faster. Here's the crazy thing about it. Intel stock is still down while the rest of the industry is up an enormous amount. Intel shares still are down.
Right now there is still down about 19% from the all-time high which was reached in like early or late 2018. Not for no reason, because at the end of the day Intel has some very real challenges. Intel is this fully vertically integrated company from design, manufacturing, fabrication like soup-to-nuts, they're one that does everything. If you look at what everybody else is trying to do, it's moved to the semiconductor companies are fabless, where they do the design and then they work with these large contract manufacturers like Taiwan Semi or Samsung mainly that do the manufacturing. They're the foundries that do the manufacturing and that means that Intel is losing a lot of customers. Apple is a great example. This is a company that's just completely gone away from Intel, and the good thing is that management at Intel has figured this out. You've got Pat Gelsinger the CEO who's in right now, who is clearly made it a mission and there is a real strategy in place, and there's a separate business unit with a leader that reports directly to the CEO that the entire mission is to build a contract manufacturing business. To work with other companies that can use, and design, and build on that x86 architecture. To build chips that they want, to do their things, and that is gigantic.
It means that right now at this phase, I think Intel is such an under-appreciated turnaround opportunity because, by the way, guess what guys? It's still a really profitable company that generates really good cash flows. That has a pretty strong balance sheet, and it's in position to spend tens of billions of dollars to add new capacity. As it makes this transition and builds this new contract manufacturing business, it can take its existing vertically integrated business. It's still really important. There's still billions and billions of dollars that are going to be spent to buy chips that Intel designs because there's lots of companies that don't want to have any involvement with designing chips, and they want to buy something off the shelf and it's going to work in their application. I think Intel is getting really, really overlooked. I think the next 10 years, Intel's absolutely going to outperform the S&P 500. It's going to take three or four years to turn this business around. Right now you can buy it and the expectations are still so low, the potential I think that's there is not priced in. I think it's a value and I think it's a great turnaround play, and that's why I bought Intel and I would encourage anybody else to think about it too.
Travis Hoium: This turnaround stories in technology happen over and over again. Apple was a turnaround story, Microsoft was really in trouble until they decided to go all in on the cloud. It seems to happen in technology over and over again where a company builds a huge business, they miss the next phase where they're out-competed by somebody else, and then they have to completely rethink their business model. But then that puts them in a solid position to win in the following phase. I think that's the bull case for Intel and I like that pick.
Hall: By the way they just reported earnings about an hour ago. Revenue up five percent year-over-year. Raising full-year earnings and margins guidance. This is a solid business and it's a profitable business.

2021-11-03 00:00:00+00:00,AMD Stock Is a Screaming Buy After Its Latest Earnings Report,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/amd-stock-is-a-screaming-buy-after-its-latest-earnings-report-2021-11-03,,,"Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) went into its third-quarter earnings report with a bunch of catalysts in the personal computing, video gaming, and data center segments. All these verticals reported rapid growth to help the company crush Wall Street expectations and deliver eye-popping results.
What's more, AMD raised its full-year guidance, on the back of robust demand for its chips. Let's look at this tech giant's latest numbers and see why it remains a top growth stock to buy, even after 39% gains so far in 2021.
Image source: Getty Images
AMD delivers outstanding growth, yet again
AMD's third-quarter revenue shot up 54% year over year to $4.3 billion, buoyed by strong sales in both computing and graphics and the enterprise, embedded, and semi-custom segments. Even better, the company's non-GAAP gross margin jumped 440 basis points year over year to 48%, thanks to an improved product mix across its key product lines: EPYC server processors, Ryzen client processors, and Radeon graphics processors.
This combination of a sharp increase in the revenue and a nice bump in the margins led to 78% year-over-year growth in AMD's adjusted earnings to $0.73 per share. The company now anticipates a 65% jump in 2021 revenue, thanks to growth across all its businesses.
It's worth noting that AMD had originally called for 37% revenue growth in 2021 in January this year. It has increased its guidance each quarter, due to the growing demand for chips used in various devices. Don't be surprised to see AMD end the year with stronger-than-expected results, especially considering the lucrative growth drivers it's sitting on.
What's driving the growth
AMD gets its revenue from two segments, as discussed earlier. The computing and graphics segment sells Ryzen processors that are used in desktops, notebooks, and workstations, as well as graphics cards that are used by both gamers and data centers. This business was in fine form last quarter and recorded 44% year-over-year revenue growth to $2.4 billion, accounting for 56% of AMD's total revenue.
The chipmaker saw an increase in the average selling price of its Ryzen processors and graphics cards, as customers bought more high-end products. There were quite a few solid takeaways from this segment, as AMD saw an increase in the adoption of its Ryzen 5000 mobile processors by notebook OEMs (original equipment manufacturers). At the same time, the commercial deployment of notebooks based on Ryzen processors increased significantly during the quarter across public-sector organizations and Fortune 1000 companies.
Meanwhile, the launch of Ryzen 5000 desktop processors with integrated AMD graphics also met with a solid response from the market. AMD says that it has now gained market share in the client-processor market for six quarters in a row.
Mercury Research estimates that AMD held 20% of the notebook CPU market at the end of the second quarter, while its share of the desktop CPU market stood at 17.1%. Intel controlled the rest of the market but has been steadily losing ground to AMD in these markets because of the latter's technological advantage. AMD has room to gain more market share from Intel in the processor space, and doing so could substantially increase the chipmaker's computing and graphics revenue in the long run.
The company is also stepping on the gas in the data center graphics-card market, where its revenue more than doubled over the prior year, thanks to the growing adoption of its GPUs (graphics processing units) in supercomputers. AMD's data center GPU revenue has doubled for two straight quarters now, which bodes well for the long run. This market is expected to hit $26 billion in revenue by 2026.
AMD didn't explicitly state how much revenue it generated from data center GPUs last quarter, but this is still a small business for the company, as it's yet to hit $500 million in annual revenue from this product line. But given the pace at which its data center GPU revenue has increased and the new design wins that the company has scored in this segment, the company seems on track to make a big dent in this market.
Then there's the enterprise, embedded, and semi-custom (EESC) segment, which accounted for the rest of AMD's revenue last quarter. The company registered a 69% year-over-year increase in sales in this segment to $1.9 billion. The strong demand for gaming consoles from Sony and Microsoft, which use AMD's semi-custom processors, was a key catalyst for this segment. More importantly, AMD's semi-custom revenue seems set for long-term growth as the demand for the PlayStation 5 and the latest Xbox consoles is expected to grow at a nice pace in the coming years.
Finally, the server-processor market turned out to be a happy hunting ground for AMD, as the company registered its sixth-straight quarter of record server revenue. AMD's server-processor revenue more than doubled year over year, which isn't surprising as it's been taking away significant market share from Intel in this space. In the second quarter, AMD's server-market share was up 3.7 percentage points year over year to 9.5%.
With AMD's EPYC server processors being selected by more supercomputers and cloud-service providers, the chipmaker's server-market share could head further north. With AMD anticipating that the server-processor market could hit $19 billion in revenue by 2023, a higher market share could boost its revenue big time.
Consider buying before it's too late
AMD stock is trading at 37 times trailing earnings. While that's higher than the S&P 500's earnings multiple of 30, the stock's valuation is still attractive, considering that it was trading at nearly 124 times earnings last year. What's more, AMD's top line had jumped 45% in 2020, so the company is on track to finish 2021 on a much stronger note.
As such, it isn't too late for investors looking to get into a growth stock to buy AMD. The chipmaker can deliver more upside, thanks to a wide range of growth drivers.

LISBON, Nov 2 (Reuters) - Chip designer Advanced Micro Devices AMD.O has been able to skirt most of the problems linked with the global chip supply shortage by forecasting demand years in advance, a top executive said on Tuesday.
Demand for electronics gadgets from people stuck in homes due to the pandemic has led to a shortage of semiconductors that are used from anything from mobile phones and cars.
But despite a squeeze in supply, AMD has been able to take market share away from rival Intel INTC.O in both PCs and servers with its latest line of processors.
""Our supply chain team has worked to make sure that we have months and years of forecast ahead into our supply chain,"" Chief Technology Officer Mark Papermaster said on the sidelines of the Web Summit conference in Lisbon, Portugal.
""Everybody has had to increase their focus on the supply chain but we did so from the very beginning of the pandemic.""
Companies with existing ties with chip fabrication companies like Taiwan's TSMC 2330.TW were also able to guarantee a steady supply. AMD, which doesn't manufacture its own chips like Intel, depends on companies such as TSMC and GlobalFoundries GFS.O to make the chips for them.
""We are using cutting edge semiconductor nodes and we are a very large purchaser in this area, so that is certainly helpful in securing our supply chain,"" Papermaster said.
Contrary to automakers, who are hardest hit by semiconductor shortage, AMD focuses on the smaller, more advanced chips which are less affected than the supply of mass-produced older chips. AMD has been focusing on high-margin chips, which not only allows the company to channel its resources but increases revenue, projected to rise 65% this year.

It's so much so, that it is impacting earnings, and why not? Semiconductors have become an integral part of our life as their applications range from 5G, data centers, Internet of Things (IoT), mobiles, and automobiles.
This has also brought into sharp focus wafer manufacturing companies as well as companies that manufacture processors and chipsets. According to Intel, the semiconductor market is likely to double to $1 trillion by 2030.
Using the TipRanks Stock Comparison tool, let us compare two such chip-making companies, Intel and AMD, and see how Wall Street analysts feel about these stocks.
Intel (INTC)
Intel has left investors disappointed with its Q3 results, which were a mixed bag. Adjusted revenues rose by only 5% year-over-year to $18.1 billion (excluding the NAND memory business, which is subject to a pending sale) but fell short of the consensus estimate of $18.24 billion.
However, encouragingly, Intel’s adjusted earnings came in at $1.71 per share, exceeding the company’s prior guidance by $0.61, and were up 59% year-over-year. Analysts were expecting earnings of $1.11 per share.
In addition, Intel’s CFO George Davis announced his retirement effective from May next year, saying that he will continue to serve in his role until Intel finds a suitable successor.
The company raised its outlook for FY21 and now expects adjusted earnings of $5.28 per share and a gross margin of 55%, while revenues are projected to be $77.7 billion. In Q4, INTC anticipates a gross margin of 51.4% on revenues of $19.2 billion, while earnings are expected to come in at $0.78 per share.
Earlier this year, INTC had unveiled a process and packaging technology roadmap - IDM (integrated device manufacturer) 2.0 strategy, which included the launch of Intel Foundry Services (IFS), a new foundry business, and a $20 billion investment in two new fabs in Arizona.
In alignment with this strategy, the company’s outgoing CFO, George Davis, announced on its Q3earnings callthat it expects capex to range between $25 billion and $28 billion in 2022. What’s more, the company’s rising investment in its foundry business also means that it anticipates gross margins to be “below current levels for the next 2-3 years before recovering but will remain comfortably above 50% as we continue to exercise financial prudence.” (See Top Smart Score stocks on TipRanks)
Mizuho Securities analyst Vijay Rakesh seems to disapprove of this strategy and thinks that it will add uncertainty “to its likelihood of catching up to leading-edge by executing on its core PC/Server roadmap and believe the GM [gross margin] reset to 51-53% (current 56%) over 2-3 years could be difficult to recover.”
Moreover, the analyst pointed out that the rise in capex is a “a significant ~100% jump from its F20-F21 Capex range at $14-$18B.” It would become “a capital drag, as it is difficult to both win in the foundry market and maintain attractive margins.”
Drawing comparisons between INTC and AMD, Rakesh emphasized that instead of Intel closing the gap with AMD on “10nm [nanometer]/7nm Sapphire Rapids/Granite Rapids” data centers, this gap could widen as Intel’s focus would be split between building its foundry capacity and “executing on the core product roadmap.”
As a result, the analyst downgraded the stock from a Buy to a Hold and lowered the price target from $70 to $55 (10.8% upside).
The rest of the Street echoes Rakesh’s view with a Hold consensus on Intel, based on 4 Buys, 12 Holds, and 6 Sells. The average Intel price target of $53.81 implies 8.5% upside potential to current levels.
Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)
Advanced Micro Devices investors are cheering, as the stock has soared 24.8% in the past month, fueled by strong financial performance in Q3. The chip giant’s revenues increased 54% year-over-year to $4.31 billion, beating analysts’ estimates of $4.12 billion. This was AMD’s fifth straight quarter of revenue growth of more than 50%.
Adjusted earnings came in at $0.73 per share, up 78% year-over-year and beating analysts’ expectations of $0.67 per share.
The company’s wide array of products includes graphics processing units (GPUs), semi-custom System-on-Chip (SOC) products and chipsets, x86 microprocessors (CPUs), and accelerated processing units that integrate microprocessors and graphics (APUs).
AMD has projected total revenue to range from $4.4 billion to $4.6 billion in Q4, an increase of 39% year-over-year, driven by growth across all businesses. Its stellar fiscal performance has also resulted in the company raising its guidance for FY21 and now expects its revenues to rise year-over-year to 65% from the prior growth rate of 60%.
Mizuho Securities analyst Vijay Rakesh noted the “strong” Q4 guidance was a result of “strength expected in Server and Gaming Consoles, with upside to previous expectations due to better procurement of wafer supply.”
The analyst is bullish with a Buy rating and raised his price target from $110 to $135 (approximately 8% upside) on the stock.
The company continues to see higher traction in its third generation EPYC processors, and AMD’s management stated on its Q3earnings callthat these processors “continue ramping faster than the prior generation and contributed the majority of our server CPU revenue in the quarter.”
Indeed, AMD’s rising revenues in Q3 were largely driven by a 69% growth in revenues when it comes to its Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom CPUs and chipsets.
Moreover, the company also expects revenues from semi-custom CPUs to rise in Q4 as gaming console demand remains strong. (See Insiders’ Hot Stocks on TipRanks)
Considering this strong demand, analyst Rakesh believes that “AMD's supply constraints at TSMC [Taiwan Semiconductor Mfg. Co.] could continue to provide upside potential to estimates if AMD can secure additional 2022 supply.”
AMD’s President and CEO, Dr. Lisa Su, elaborated on this at itsearnings call saying, “I think we’re prioritizing in the most strategic segments. And we have invested significantly in capacity for additional capabilities, and we’ll see some of that come online as we go through 2022.”
Lastly, analyst Rakesh continues to see AMD as “well-positioned with a strong server roadmap and a XLNX acquisition ahead (we estimate ~$0.02 EPS accretion), with INTC potentially losing PC/Server ground by shifting focus to foundry.”
AMD continues to expect to close its $35 billion acquisition of Xilinx (XLNX) by the end of this year.
Wall Street analysts, however, are cautiously optimistic and the consensus is that AMD is a Moderate Buy, based on 13 Buys and 8 Holds. The average AMD price target of $136.57 implies 9.2% upside potential to current levels.
Bottom Line
While analysts seem to be in a wait-and-watch mode with Intel, they are cautiously optimistic about AMD. As analyst Rakesh noted in his research report, he remains concerned that “a combination of potential excess in-house Foundry capacity in the coming years, competitive AMD pricing pressures, and lagging-edge Foundry” could continue to pressure gross margins for INTC.
Furthermore, the analyst commented that the “recent accelerated foundry pivot could provide further share gains in Server for AMD.”

In the last twelve months, the biggest single purchase by an insider was when insider Robert Swan bought US$1.5m worth of shares at a price of US$56.09 per share. That means that even when the share price was higher than US$49.55 (the recent price), an insider wanted to purchase shares. While their view may have changed since the purchase was made, this does at least suggest they have had confidence in the company's future. We always take careful note of the price insiders pay when purchasing shares. It is generally more encouraging if they paid above the current price, as it suggests they saw value, even at higher levels.
In the last twelve months Intel insiders were buying shares, but not selling. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!
NasdaqGS:INTC Insider Trading Volume November 2nd 2021
Intel is not the only stock insiders are buying. So take a peek at this free list of growing companies with insider buying.
Insider Ownership
Looking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. It appears that Intel insiders own 0.05% of the company, worth about US$98m. While this is a strong but not outstanding level of insider ownership, it's enough to indicate some alignment between management and smaller shareholders.
So What Do The Intel Insider Transactions Indicate?
The recent insider purchases are heartening. And the longer term insider transactions also give us confidence. Insiders likely see value in Intel shares, given these transactions (along with notable insider ownership of the company). While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision. For instance, we've identified 2 warning signs for Intel (1 shouldn't be ignored) you should be aware of.
Of course Intel may not be the best stock to buy. So you may wish to see this free collection of high quality companies.
For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body. We currently account for open market transactions and private dispositions, but not derivative transactions.

If you look at the change over the last five and ten days, the stock has returned 5% and 12%, respectively, thus having outperformed the market on both occasions. AMD reported stellar Q3 ’21 earnings this week, with revenue jumping to $4.3 billion from $2.8 billion for the same period last year. With COGS and other operating expenses in control, operating income more than doubled from $449 million in Q3 ’20 to $948 million in Q3 ’21. This enabled the company to report an EPS growth of 2.3x, as EPS came in at $0.76, up from $0.33 in Q3 ’20. Additionally, analysts estimate AMD’s growth to continue, supported by strong expected laptop and gaming console sales over the holiday season.
Now, is AMD stock set to rise further or could we expect some correction? We believe that there is a decent 63% chance of a rise in AMD stock over the next month (21 trading days) based on our machine learning analysis of trends in the stock price over the last ten years.

2021-11-01 00:00:00+00:00,Hard-Hit Micron Stock Presents a Perfect Entry Opportunity,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/hard-hit-micron-stock-presents-a-perfect-entry-opportunity-2021-11-01,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
It’s not a secret that the world is suffering from a chip shortage. This is most likely the byproduct of the world shutting down last year thanks to the coronavirus pandemic. I have confidence that companies will figure out a way around this soon. Therefore, the dip in Micron (NYSE:MU) stock is an opportunity for investment. This would be as long as the equity remains bullish on Wall Street.
MU) name on the side of a building."" width=""300"" height=""169"">

The fundamentals for this company are solid.
I wouldn’t call them high flying marks, because they’re not. The revenues are growing at a moderate pace. And the company is making the best of it down to the bottom line.
The valuation for MU stock is reasonable. It has a low price-to-earnings ratio under 14x, and a price-to-sales ratio of 3x. Nothing from its financials indicates that it’s bloated.
As such, the slide in MU stock does not indicate that the story there is bad. Management is solid, but the investors are chasing sexier stories.
7 High-Yield Retirement Stocks To Feather Your Nest Egg
The whole chip sector is not moving in unison, so there are mega winners and laggards. Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and MU are two quality companies that are simply not getting the respect they deserve.
MU Stock Is Near Support

Situations like these more often than not are opportunities for patient investors. On the opposite end of the spectrum there are companies like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and Xilinx (NASDAQ:XLNX). These three for example are up 94%, 29% and 25% year-to-date, respectively.
Technically, Micron’s stock chart could have some good news. After incredible exuberance from last September, the stock lost 30% of its value since April. This is enough eliminated froth to warrant investor interest. Arguably, the rally last year accelerated once MU stock broke out from $65 for share.
As of last week, it had come within pennies of that neckline. From last year’s March low to its April highs, the rally was 213%. This recent downturn has given much of it back, and this is normal price action. It’s too late to sell since the correction came without any intrinsic reason.
The weak hands have already let go of MU stock. From here, the bears will need new negative catalysts to punish it. This makes for a reasonable entry position. That’s especially true for those who are interested in it for the long term. Those who know how to use options can even create an additional buffer zone. Selling puts below current prices makes for a good alternative to buying shares.
Moderation Is Key
Caution is critical here regardless of the method you chose. That’s because the indices are at record levels. This escalates the possibility of sharp and sudden corrections.
This week is full of potential catalysts. For example, the Federal Reserve is likely to officially announce the tapering of its asset purchases on Wednesday. We also have the jobs report on Friday. Either of these could easily solicit an emotional knee-jerk reaction in stocks.
Even though market dips are opportunities to buy the indices, they would foil any MU rebound. This means that regardless of how strong the individual story from Micron, investors need to remain cautious overall. Stocks cannot rally alone if the indices are correcting.
Last week, the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEARCA:XLK) and the Nasdaq broke out into open air. The upside potential from that could extend another 8%. If that happens, MU stock is likely to benefit and follow along. So far it is languishing, down 5% this year, while the XLK and the VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SMH) are up 25%. This relative under-performance is part of the opportunity today.
The opinions on Micron among the experts are all over the map. I bet you will find headlines that tout that it is a screaming buy, while others call it outrageously expensive. Both extremes will be wrong in the end.
Ultimately, somewhere in the middle lies the truth.

2021-11-01 00:00:00+00:00,"These Two Stocks Have Been Lagging the Market, and Now Insiders are Buying In",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/these-two-stocks-have-been-lagging-the-market-and-now-insiders-are-buying-in-2021-11-01,,,"Capital markets have had a tremendous month, with most major U.S. indices seeing consistent gains and the Nasdaq-100 making the sharpest moves. Tech earnings have been mixed, with some firms posting record revenues and others noting the supply-side constraints as reasons for their Q3 difficulties.  
Now comes the tricky part. It can be a risky move buying into stocks which have made considerable recent gains, and the ones which missed earnings have typically sold-off as a reaction to impacted outlooks. So which are the ones to focus on? TipRanks’ Insider Trading tools are there to offer some alternative investment resources and help traders decide what is best for them.  
Insider trading is not illegal, for the most part. Insiders are denoted by their stake of 10% or more in a publicly traded company, role on a board of directors, or position as a senior officer. They are allowed to make trades in specific companies as they wish, as long as they submit a Form 4 to the Securities and Exchange Commission beforehand. Upon approval, their trades are made public record.  
While insiders may make trades for any particular reason, the most indicative of them is the Informative Buy. This type of transaction signifies that the insider used his or her own capital to buy into a stock. The thought process is as follows: if insiders know something will positively affect the shares, it could be beneficial for the everyday investor to follow their trades.  
TipRanks has several tools that organize and collate recent transactions into a digestible visual display. For example, Insiders’ Hot Stocks shows which insider buying strategies have been used recently, and the Top 25 Corporate Insiders tracks all the most successful insiders on a rolling basis. To see the most recent trades made, Daily Insider Transactions tracks them in a chronological order.  
Let’s take a look at analysis of two stocks seeing recent significant insider trading activity.  
Intel  
Tech and the Nasdaq-100 have been soaring the last few weeks, but Intel has underperformed. The global semiconductor shortage has not been capitalized upon by the largest chip manufacturer in the world by revenue, and large hardware producers like Apple (AAPL) and Alphabet (GOOGL) have moved to producing their chips in-house.  
As a result, Intel Corporation (INTC) has slumped. Its Q3 earnings missed on several key metrics, and investors have been shaken off toward other chip makers, like AMD (AMD) and Nvidia (NVDA). However, a group of insiders have been accumulating considerable positions in the underperforming tech giant.  
By checking TipRanks Insider’s page on Intel, it can be identified that over the last six days, five individuals have made Informative Buys in company stock. Among them is Patrick Gelsinger, Chief Executive Officer, who purchased just under half a million dollars of shares. A skeptic could argue that CEOs often buy shares in their own company. However, Gelsinger is not alone in his sentiment, and is accompanied by several high-ranking members of the board of directors.  
Intel shares have slumped more than 12% over the last 10 days, after falling sharply following the company's earnings release. After the negative print, analysts weighed in.  
Quinn Bolton of Needham & Co. published a report arguing that while the earnings results and guidance “played into the bears’ hands,” a shift in Intel’s downtrend is inevitable. Quinn placed his faith in CEO Gelsinger, writing that the company will be able to “identify weaknesses in its processor roadmap and reestablish its processor performance leadership.” The analyst noted that the “turnaround will ultimately be successful,” making the current valuation attractive for long-term entry.  
Bolton assigned a bullish Buy rating to the stock, and added a price target of $60. 
Upstart  
There is another technology firm whose valuation has fallen while most have gained. Peer-to-peer lending company Upstart Holdings, Inc. (UPST) has seen its valuation come down more than 17% since its October 15 peak. At the same time, it is important to note that the AI-powered fintech had gained about 630% YTD in share price by the time it began to decline. The high valuation places the stock at a precarious position wherein small events can shake large amounts of investors.  
There is someone attempting to capitalize on the discounted share price, however. Co-founder and current Senior Vice President of Product and Data Science, Gu Paul, has been buying stock. The insider made two consecutive trades over the last 3 days, each amounting to $27,000 in shares. While these pale in comparison to his holding value of $98,145,960, Paul’s success with his trades is significant and could be followed by the ambitious investor.  
Paul’s transactions have been profitable 80% of the time, and over the last year have returned him, on average, 186.9%.  
Chiming in on the stock’s recent movements, John Hecht of Jefferies wrote that “the equity value reflects strong and successful market penetration in the personal and auto loan categories over the next few years.” However, he sees the current growth as unsustainable, and thus does not expect the stock to continue seeing similar gains in valuation. Moreover, Hecht added that the current share price reflects “aspirational market share advancements.”  
In a neutral move, Hecht downgraded UPST to Hold from its former Buy rating, and declared a price target of $330 per share.

When looking for the top tech stocks in the stock market right now, investors are spoilt for choices. It all depends on what you believe will be the dominant tech that would shape the future. Whether it is a cloud computing company such as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) or an electric vehicle company such as Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA), they all heavily rely on the intricacies of technology to improve their products and offerings. Given how reliant we are on technology today, it would be a safe assumption that this trend would likely continue. 
As we cruise through the third-quarter earnings season, many of the tech stocks are reporting better-than-expected numbers. Smart investors who anticipated this would have benefited greatly. Take Silicon Laboratories (NASDAQ: SLAB) as an example. The company stock climbed over 20% in response to a strong third-quarter earnings report. It posted adjusted earnings per share of $0.34, far exceeding the expectations for $0.15. And there may be other companies with similar potential in the tech space today. With that in mind, do you have a list of the top tech stocks in thestock market today
Best Tech Stocks To Watch Heading Into November 2021
Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC)
NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA)
Wolfspeed Inc (NYSE: WOLF)
Teradyne, Inc. (NASDAQ: TER)
Intel 
Let us start the list with one of the top names in the tech space, Intel. Sure, it may have fallen off some investors’ radar over the years, but the fact remains that it is still one of the industry leaders. Since Pat Gelsinger became the CEO earlier this year, the company has been actively trying to regain its throne with plenty of exciting developments.
For instance, the company launched the first products in the 12th Gen Intel Core™ family on Thursday. This would include the Intel Core i9-12900K, the world’s best gaming processor. It has a new performance hybrid architecture that delivers leaps in multi-threaded performance while enabling up to two times faster creation compared to prior generations. Safe to say, the company will be delivering new levels of leadership performance for generations to come. 
In addition, the company and Helbiz (NASDAQ: HLBZ) have strengthened their global partnership recently. Helbiz will expand the integration of its electric vehicles (EV) within Intel’s Moovit app. This means that Moovit users will have access to Helbiz’s suite of micro-mobility vehicles in more than 35 of its operating cities. All in all, it appears that the best is yet to come for Intel. So, would you add INTC stock to your watchlist today?

NVIDIA 
Nvidia is an American multinational tech company that specializes in graphics processing units (GPUs). For most parts, it caters to the gaming and professional markets, as well as system on chip units (SoCs) for the mobile computing and automotive markets. Impressively, NVDA stock has soared more than 90% since the start of the year.
Despite its success over the years, the company continues to innovate and push its boundaries. Just last week, the company announced its next-generation cloud gaming platform that will be available exclusively in a new, high-performance membership tier. The GeForce NOW RTX 3080 membership tier will provide gamers with access to the greatest-ever generational leap in GeForce history. How is this so? Well, it will deliver the highest resolutions and fastest frame rates, paired with the lowest latency. 
It is a good time to be alive for gaming enthusiasts this year. We also saw the company announcing that Electronic Arts (NASDAQ: EA) will be bringing more of its hit games to the NVIDIA GeForce NOW™ cloud gaming service last month. It begins with Battlefield Revolution, Mirror’s Edge Catalyst, Unravel Two, Dragon Age: Inquisition, and Apex Legends. With this flurry of exciting developments, do you have NVDA stock as a top tech stock to watch now?
Wolfspeed
Another tech company making waves lately would be Wolfspeed. Essentially, the company offers silicon carbide technology and production. Its product families include power-switching devices and radiofrequency devices targeted for applications such as EVs, fast charging, 5G, renewable energy, and aerospace and defense. WOLF stock soared by more than 30% over the past week. So, let us see what the catalyst for this bullish hike was.
For starters, investors appear to be responding well to its fiscal 2022 first-quarter earnings report. It posted a revenue of $156.6 million, representing an increase of 36% year-over-year. This is the company’s fifth consecutive quarter of revenue growth that is driven by the rapidly expanding market for Silicon Carbide products. Wolfspeed expects this to continue in its second quarter as it set a target revenue in a range of $165 million to $175 million. 
On top of that, Wolfspeed and the Biophysical Economics Institute announced recently the completion of a pioneering study that demonstrates the superior performance of Silicon Carbide against traditional semiconductor devices in EVs. It appears that Silicon Carbide used in the powertrain of an EV would deliver 13:1 energy savings. This amount of energy conservation would allow for longer range, and faster charging. Who knows, this new discovery could be a game-changer for the semiconductor industry. With that in mind, are you on the verge of jumping on the WOLF stock bandwagon?

Teradyne
To sum up the list, we will be looking at Teradyne. This is a company that supplies automation equipment for test and industrial applications. Its business segments include Semiconductor Tests, System Tests, Industrial Automation, and Wireless Tests. TER stock is yet another in the industry that had a sudden jump due to a strong quarterly report. It has risen more than 25% over the past month.
On Wednesday, the company reported its third-quarter financial update. It posted revenue of $951 million, up 16% year-over-year. Meanwhile, its GAAP earnings per share grew 17% to $1.41. This shows that demand for its products remained strong in the third quarter as it delivered its eighth consecutive quarter of double-digit, year-over-year revenue and profit growth. These are encouraging figures that would draw the attention of prospective investors. 
Earlier this month, LitePoint, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Teradyne announced a collaboration with Microchip Technology to deliver simplified design validation and turnkey manufacturing test solutions for the Internet of Things (IoT) systems. LitePoint will provide its IQfact+™ test automation software tailored for Microchip’s new WFI321E01 series of Wi-Fi MCU modules. This combination would provide its customers with the tools they need to meet their demand for increasingly complex products. All things considered, do you think TER stock will have more room for growth?

2021-10-31 00:00:00+00:00,3 Tech Stocks to Buy That Just Crushed Earnings,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-tech-stocks-to-buy-that-just-crushed-earnings-2021-10-31,,,"Third-quarter earnings season is in full swing, and many companies are reporting huge year-over-year growth figures as they lap their depressed financial results from a year ago (when the world was still largely on lockdown early in the pandemic). But not all companies are getting a boost because they were down in the dumps in 2020. Tech giants have been posting incredible returns for years, and look like they won't be slowing down anytime soon.
Three Fool.com contributors think there's still plenty to like about Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG), Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) after they crushed earnings. Here's why they believe they're still a buy.
Image source: Getty Images.
Google search is an unstoppable force
Nicholas Rossolillo (Alphabet): The internet search titan is knocking on the door of a $2 trillion valuation after its Q3 2021 report card -- and for good reason. Google's parent company Alphabet beat expectations during the summer months, reporting a respective 41% and 61% year-over-year increase in revenue (to $46.2 billion) and free cash flow ($18.7 billion). Bear in mind Google's core advertising business had already returned to growth mode this same period last year after a brief dip in Q2, so this isn't a simple story of a business clearing an easy hurdle from 2020.
Outside of digital ads, which remain a long-term secular growth trend, other elements of the business were firing in sync as well. ""Google other"" (which includes Pixel devices, subscriptions, the app store, etc.) grew 23% to $6.75 billion in sales, and Google Cloud increased 45% to $4.99 billion.
And on the bottom line, free cash flow profit margin was 40%, a fantastic result considering this is still a growth company investing heavily to foster future expansion. Included in that overall profit margin was yet another 10-figure operating loss on ""Other Bets"" (Waymo self-driving cars, Verily life sciences, and other early-stage disruptive tech) of $1.29 billion in Q3.
Google remains a fantastic long-term investment story, and is fairly priced given the double-digit growth numbers the company is still consistently churning out. The stock trades for 28 times trailing-12-month free cash flow-to-enterprise value after the Q3 update. Google remains my personal favorite buy of all the mega-cap tech stocks.
Intel: Spend money now to make money later
Anders Bylund (Intel): Semiconductor titan Intel smashed the Street's earnings estimates in Oct. 21's third-quarter update. Earnings rose 54% year over year, landing at $1.71 per diluted share. Your average analyst would have settled for $1.11 per share. The company also raised its adjusted full-year earnings guidance from $4.80 to $5.28 per share. Free cash flows are now expected to stop near $12.5 billion for the full year, up from $11 billion in the second-quarter version of Intel's guidance.
The good news don't stop there. Intel has broken ground on two new chip-making sites in Arizona, laying the groundwork for a massive long-term investment in the company's physical infrastructure. Demand is strong across all of Intel's target markets, and order shipments are only held back by the same industrywide manufacturing challenges that are facing the whole semiconductor sector these days.
Yet, Intel's stock plunged on the earnings release and now sits more than 14% below the closing price on the night of the report. You can pick up Intel shares at the bargain-bin valuation of 10.7 times trailing earnings and 5.9 times free cash flows.
That's because many market makers were quick to brush off the long-term benefits of Intel's ambitious growth plans, focusing exclusively on the costly investments that will unlock those future benefits. That's a big mistake in my view, and I am sorely tempted to add a few more shares to my own Intel holdings at these inviting stock prices.
Microsoft's cloud juggernaut sees no signs of letting up
Billy Duberstein (Microsoft): Cloud and software giant Microsoft has become so boring, what, with its 11-quarter streak of revenue and earnings beats and all!
Of course, shareholders certainly aren't bored. Neither are analysts at Citigroup, who raised their price target to a Street-high of $407 after last week's blowout earnings report, 25% higher than today's post-earnings price and a whopping 85% higher than Microsoft's stock price to start the year.
You may think of Microsoft as a conglomerate with a lot of different products: Windows, Office, Dynamics, Azure, Teams, LinkedIn, and others. Each one of those businesses is fantastic, but what really came through on the conference call with analysts is how Microsoft is now able to integrate all these tools in a powerful, unified platform that makes comprehensive cloud transformation simple and efficient.
Management calls this integrated set of tools the Microsoft Cloud, which grew 36% to surpass $20 billion in quarterly revenue for the first time last quarter. While many leading software companies offer or specialize in a few of the things Microsoft Cloud does, no one can really offer the full end-to-end platform Microsoft can. Integrating the Azure public cloud, Dynamics 365 enterprise resource planning, Office 365, Teams, cybersecurity, the low/no-code Power business intelligence and automation platform, and GitHub for developers, Microsoft Cloud is a turnkey solution that's simple for businesses to set up and use with a quick time-to-value.
With the platform now fully developed, Microsoft is tailoring its cloud to specific industries. It has already unveiled a healthcare-specific cloud, which should only be enhanced by the pending acquisition of Nuance Communications, an artificial intelligence platform for healthcare and other industries. Industry-specific clouds for financial services and manufacturing are set to be unveiled this week. Microsoft even introduced Microsoft Cloud for sustainability, which helps organizations monitor their carbon footprint across their entire business. In the age of ESG investing, that should be a hit as well.
Can Microsoft keep it up? I think it can. The Microsoft Cloud spans Microsoft's intelligent cloud and business process software segments. The intelligent cloud segment is now not only the fastest-growing segment, but has become the largest segment as well. Intelligent cloud grew 31% last quarter, compared with overall company growth of 22%. Since the intelligent cloud now makes up a larger part of the business and sees no signs of letting up, Microsoft looks set to maintain an astoundingly high level of growth for such a large company; oh, and profit margins are expanding too, so profit growth should even exceed revenue growth.
So while the stock may look somewhat pricy at 40 times earnings, given the prospects for a decade of profitable growth, I think Microsoft can still be bought even at these frothy post-earnings levels. It's a core large-cap holding for any investor today.

2021-10-29 00:00:00+00:00,"3 Reasons to Buy AMD, and 1 Reason to Sell",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-reasons-to-buy-amd-and-1-reason-to-sell-2021-10-29,,,"The stock of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) held steady after the chipmaker posted its third-quarter earnings report on Tuesday.
Its revenue rose 54% year over year to $4.31 billion, beating estimates by $200 million. Its adjusted net income increased 78% to $893 million, or $0.73 per share, which also cleared expectations by $0.07. For the fourth quarter, AMD expects its revenue to rise about 39% year over year, compared to analysts' expectations for 31% growth.
Those headline numbers are impressive, but investors might be reluctant to touch AMD's stock after its price has advanced about 50% over the past 12 months. Let's examine three reasons to buy AMD right now (as well as one reason to sell it) to see if this hot chipmaker is still a worthwhile investment.
CEO Lisa Su of AMD. Image source: AMD.
1. AMD is still profiting from Intel's mistakes
AMD's comeback over the past seven years was driven by two main catalysts. First, Dr. Lisa Su took over as the CEO and led the development of its new Ryzen CPUs for PCs and Epyc CPUs for data centers. These new chips addressed the poor single-threaded performance of AMD's previous CPUs and challenged Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) with more cost-efficient processors.
Second, Intel repeatedly stumbled with chip shortages, delays, and leadership changes. It fell behind Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM), or TSMC, in the process race to create smaller and more power-efficient chips. This enabled AMD, which outsourced its production to TSMC, to pull ahead with more-advanced chips.
Here's how rapidly AMD has grown its market share across the desktop, laptop, and server markets against Intel, according to PassMark Software:

AMD's recent partnership with Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) to launch new Windows 11 PCs with Ryzen CPUs and Radeon GPUs indicates its share of the PC market will continue to grow. Its new cloud deals with Alphabet's Google, Amazon, and Cloudflare will also ensure that Epyc continues to gain ground against Intel's Xeon processors in the data center market.
AMD's data center business will likely grow even stronger if it closes its planned acquisition of the programmable chipmaker Xilinx (NASDAQ: XLNX) this year.
2. Robust growth rates with rising margins
In the first nine months of 2021, AMD generated 58% of its revenue from the computing and graphics division, which sells its PC CPUs and GPUs. The remaining 42% came from its enterprise, embedded, and semi-custom (EESC) division, which primarily sells its Epyc CPUs for data centers and custom accelerated processing units (APUs) for Sony and Microsoft's gaming consoles.
Here's how those two businesses fared in fiscal 2020 and the first nine months of 2021:

As those two businesses grew, AMD's margins expanded as it sold more higher-margin Epyc, Ryzen, and Radeon chips:

AMD expects its full-year revenue to rise 65% with an adjusted gross margin of approximately 48%. Analysts expect its adjusted earnings to increase by 93% for the full year.
3. Reasonable valuations
AMD has been a red-hot stock over the past year, but it still looks reasonably valued at 40 times forward earnings. It might seem a lot pricier than Intel, which trades at just 11 times forward earnings, but AMD arguably deserves a higher premium while Intel deserves a deeper discount.
AMD is firing on all cylinders under a visionary CEO, and outsourcing its chip production to TSMC enables it to avoid all of Intel's first-party foundry headaches. Meanwhile, Intel needs to execute a costly turnaround to reverse its market share losses.
The one reason to sell AMD: Intel's potential comeback
Intel's recent third-quarter report indicates its turnaround won't happen anytime soon. But CEO Pat Gelsinger, an engineering veteran who took the helm last February, believes Intel can reclaim the process lead from TSMC by 2025 by aggressively expanding and upgrading its plants.
Many investors are dismissing Intel as an also-ran right now, but they should recall that AMD nearly overtook Intel back in 2006 before Intel struck back with aggressive research and development and marketing efforts. So if Intel finally gets its act together, AMD's second heyday could abruptly end.
AMD is still a great long-term investment
Intel's potential rebirth under Pat Gelsinger might generate unpredictable headwinds for AMD over the next few years. But I believe AMD still has a much brighter future than Intel -- and its strengths should continue to outweigh its weaknesses as long as Lisa Su remains in charge.

Ahead of Intel’s (NASDAQ:INTC) recently posted third-quarter results, the stock rallied, in accordance with its tradition. INTC stock rose steadily from $52 to $56 ahead of its earnings, only to plunge and close below $50 after the results were released.

Why did investors bet that Intel would beat analysts’ average expectations when the chip maker is falling behind its competitors? The giant used to sell premium processors. Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) used to sell over-heated, under-performing processors at a discount.
The table turned in the last few years. But now Intel is finding its way back to growth, and it has many ways to reaccelerate its business.
INTC Stock Slumps After Intel’s Q3 Results
In Q3, Intel’s sales climbed by a modest 5% year-over-year to $19.2 billion. Its Data Center unit benefited from the record quarterly revenue of both Mobileye and its Internet of Things Group. Despite Intel raising its full-year 2021 earnings per share outlook  to $4.50 and providing gross margin guidance of 55%, investors dumped INTC stock.
Markets expressed disappointment in Intel’s nearly flat revenue growth. The trading volume of Intel’s shares has reached levels not seen since January.
There are reasons to be disappointed in Intel’s results. The world is facing an unprecedented chip shortage, yet Intel’s revenue growth failed to accelerate and its margins did not climb.

On the other hand, Intel said that the demand for all of  its unit’s products was strong. And all three of its main markets –PC, server, and Internet of Things – are expected to grow meaningfully going forward.
HP Inc. (NYSE:HPQ) reaffirmed Intel’s positive outlook. HP announced strong EPS, free cash flow, and will return at least 100% of its fiscal 2022 free cash flow to shareholders.
Dell (NYSE:DELL) traded at new 52-week highs as investors expected PC sales to be strong going forward. Dell’s VMWare (NYSE:VMW) spinoff is also helping its stock climb.
Intel’s Risks
Intel’s CEO, Pat Gelsinger, said that its margins would be pressured in 2022. He cited higher manufacturing costs, caused by the company’s efforts to meet its long-term goals, as a factor behind the margin pressure.
In the last quarter, the firm has been in the early phases of growing its networking business. It will take time for that process to unfold.
Intel is not benefitting yet from its entry into the discrete graphics card business. Still, AMD and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) are charging high prices for their graphics cards. But until Intel sells a high number of top-end GPUs, its overall revenue growth could  disappoint investors.
A Growth Opportunity
Mobileye can boost Intel’s growth. The unit’s Q3 revenue jumped 39% YOY to $326 million, setting an all-time Q3 record. Its operating margins climbed 123%  YOY to $105 million.  Autonomous robotaxi services will eventually take off. When Mobileye, together with its partners,  begins its driverless pilot in Munich in 2022, positive media coverage should attract investors to INTC stock.
The Alder Lake chips will be a positive catalyst for Intel as they start shipping. The chips will give customers plenty of performance increases across a range of workloads, including gaming, artificial intelligence acceleration, and content creation.
Most analysts reiterated their “buy” rating on the stock following its earnings report. Still, analysts who rate the stock a “sell” set a price target of $40 to $45 on the shares. Value investors can open bullish positions in the beat-up technology giant at those levels.

2021-10-29 00:00:00+00:00,Here's Why Intel Could Be a Top Growth Stock in the Long Run,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/heres-why-intel-could-be-a-top-growth-stock-in-the-long-run-2021-10-29,,,"The stock market reacted negatively to Intel's (NASDAQ: INTC) latest quarterly results, with shares of the chipmaker losing nearly 12% following the earnings release. This wasn't surprising considering that the chip giant's third-quarter report didn't tick all the boxes, as its earnings guidance fell short of Wall Street's expectations. Intel expects its fourth-quarter earnings will drop 39% year over year to $0.90 per share, while analysts were looking for $1.02 per share. Investors also took dim view of the fact that the company's long-term spending plan that's supposed to kick-start growth will hurt profitability.
More specifically, Intel's gross margin is expected to drop 6.5 percentage points year over year this quarter. The chipmaker also pointed out that its gross margin will range between 51% and 53% for the next two to three years. For comparison, Intel's non-GAAP gross margin stood at 60.1% in 2019 and 57.6% in 2020. A lower gross margin profile points toward an erosion in Intel's earnings power, so it isn't surprising some investors were quick to sell the stock.
However, savvy investors looking to buy a semiconductor stock for the long run can treat Intel's latest drop as a buying opportunity. Here's why.

Don't miss the silver linings in Intel's latest report
The client computing group (CCG) was Intel's biggest business segment last quarter, with $9.7 billion in sales. The segment's revenue was down 2% year over year thanks to component shortages that hampered production and hurt sales of its lower-end processors. This weighed on the chipmaker's overall non-GAAP revenue, which came in at $18.1 billion for the quarter, up 5% over last year but slightly short of the $18.2 billion Wall Street expected.
Particularly, Intel's notebook platform processor volumes dropped 14% year over year. However, the good part is that the average selling prices (ASPs) of its notebook processors increased 10% year over year thanks to an improved product mix. Intel pointed out on the latest earnings conference call that it saw ""a richer mix of premium notebook products"" during the period. This led to a sharp improvement in the ASP compared to the second quarter, when prices of notebook processors were down 17% over the prior year.
Additionally, the ASP of Intel's desktop processors increased 4% over the prior year, while volumes grew 16% on the back of stronger sales of its higher-end processors. Meanwhile, the data center group (DCG), which is Intel's second-largest source of revenue, also improved during the period, with ASP increasing 3% year over year and volumes jumping 8%. The DCG reported a 10% year-over-year increase in revenue to $6.5 billion -- a Q3 record -- driven by a recovery in demand from the enterprise, government, and communication service provider segments.
The Internet of Things (IoT) business also turned in a terrific performance, with record revenue of $1 billion in the third quarter, up 54% from the year-ago period as demand continued to recover in the wake of the coronavirus-fueled downturn last year. Intel is now looking to capitalize on the diverse end-market opportunities that it sees going forward, which is why it has decided to ramp up investments and keep the bigger picture in mind.
Playing the long game
Intel has outlined capital expenditures of $25 billion to $28 billion for 2022, adding that there is the ""potential for further growth"" in this metric in the coming years. For comparison, the chipmaker is expected to spend between $18 billion and $19 billion in capital expenditures this year.
This massive jump in spending is going to weigh on Intel's bottom-line performance, but it can also set the company up for robust long-term growth. CEO Pat Gelsinger highlighted that the management team in the short term is focusing on investing to strengthen the long-term business operations.
Gelsinger added that the launch of five manufacturing process nodes in the next four years, although they will stretch the margins presently, the manufacturing process improvements will grow the long-range margins. Intel is looking to regain its technology leadership from rival Advanced Micro Devices by launching new process nodes in the coming years that promise sharp gains in performance.
Better chips can help Intel regain its pricing power. The good part is that Intel already showed us last quarter that it can command improved prices thanks to Tiger Lake and Alder Lake chips based on the 10-nanometer manufacturing process, which brings the company at par with AMD's 7-nanometer process.
Also, Intel has broken ground on two new fabrication facilities in Arizona, three months ahead of its original plan which is an extensive component of the capital expenditures. The company is looking to add capacity aggressively, citing the rapidly growing demand for chips. It pointed out that the semiconductor industry's revenue could double to $1 trillion by 2030, so the investments in new facilities and research and development look like the smart thing to do given the bigger picture.
All told, Intel is looking to regain its mojo and seize back the market share that it has been losing to rivals. Of course, this will pressure its margins in the near term, but patient investors looking to buy a tech stock for the long run may be rewarded handsomely once Intel's investments start paying off. Given that shares are trading at just 9.6 times trailing earnings, it may be a good idea for savvy investors to buy the stock and wait patiently for a turnaround. Intel's latest quarterly results show that it can gradually switch into a higher gear.

2021-10-29 00:00:00+00:00,Nvidia Stock Could Build On Stellar Weekly Returns,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/nvidia-stock-could-build-on-stellar-weekly-returns-2021-10-29,,,"Nvidia stock (NASDAQ: NVDA) is up 11% in just one week, completely outperforming the S&P 500 which was up just around 1%. If you look at the change over the last ten days and one month, the stock has returned 20% and 14%, respectively, thus having outperformed the market on both occasions. Last week, Nvidia announced its GeForce NOW RTX 3080 membership, which would allow users to stream over 1,100 games at high video quality and 120 FPS. Further, this week Facebook announced plans to boost spending on data centers, servers, and network infrastructure. This move is expected to strongly benefit Nvidia, whose data center revenues have surged over the past couple of years. To top it all, Piper Sandler placed a $260 price target on Nvidia’s stock, despite recent supply chain concerns. Analysts expect Nvidia to report steady revenue growth, supported by strong expected gaming console sales over the holiday season. The combined impact of these factors helped boost Nvidia’s stock by 11% over the past five trading days.
Now, is NVDA stock set to rise further or could we expect some correction? We believe that there is a strong 70% chance of a rise in NVDA stock over the next month (21 trading days) based on our machine learning analysis of trends in the stock price over the last ten years.

2021-10-29 00:00:00+00:00,Third Point set to play long game in pressuring Shell,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/third-point-set-to-play-long-game-in-pressuring-shell-2021-10-29,,,"By Svea Herbst-Bayliss
Oct 29 (Reuters) - When investors saw Daniel Loeb's Third Point LLC unveil a stake in Royal Dutch Shell RDSa.L, some were quick to make the comparison to Exxon Mobil Corp XOM.N, whose board was challenged this year by another hedge fund, Engine No. 1.
Both oil majors have been under pressure to improve financial performance and accelerate their transition away from fossil fuels. Exxon saw three directors unseated when Engine No. 1 won a proxy contest in May.
Yet Third Point plans to follow a different tack, according to people familiar with its plans. It has not put forward any board nominees or threatened the chief executive's job and there are no immediate plans to do so, the sources said.
Instead, the $19 billion fund outlined its suggestions to Shell in a letter to its own investors, making for a low-key introduction of its hopes for the $190 billion oil company.
Third Point's founder, billionaire investor Daniel Loeb, wants the Anglo-Dutch company to separate its oil and gas business from its renewable-energy and liquefied-natural-gas operations. His team has had conversations with the company and Shell was given a heads up on Third Point's announcement, sources familiar with the matter said.
When Shell pushed back on Loeb on Thursday, he did not follow up with a white paper detailing company missteps, as activists often do. He did not unveil a website with videos laying out his case or go on television to discuss the matter.
The strategy echoes the playbook employed at other companies where Third Point pushed for changes, including food company Nestle NESN.S and entertainment company Walt Disney DIS.N.
Third Point goes activist on one or maybe two companies a year, largely avoiding the threat of proxy contests in favor of long-term engagement. On Twitter Loeb has been known to send encouraging and complimentary messages to CEOs.
This is a dramatic change for Loeb, whose sharp-tongued letters sent to executives years ago have been memorialized on blogs. Despite today's less brash public tactics, Third Point and Loeb often make inroads.
Chip maker Intel Corp INTC.O named a new CEO in January 2021 after Third Point's investment became public a month earlier. British insurer Prudential Plc PRU.L said in January that it would spin off its U.S. business, less than a year after Third Point pushed for such a move in early 2020.
A representative said Loeb was not available for an interview and declined to comment on next steps.
Loeb, who pursues a rigorous yoga routine, founded the firm 25 years ago, a lifetime in the hedge fund industry, and came close to going out of business during the financial crisis. He is one of few founders of older hedge funds who is still firmly in charge, several investors said.
Activism is only one of the firm's strategies, allowing for a longer-term approach, if needed, for results.
This year, Third Point's roughly 30% gains were largely fueled by its venture-capital investments, and has made money during the pandemic through its structured credit investments.

2021-10-28 00:00:00+00:00,My Take on AMD's Strong Earnings Report,INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/my-take-on-amds-strong-earnings-report-2021-10-28,,,"Today's video focuses on Advanced Micro Devices' (NASDAQ:AMD) recent earnings reported on Oct. 26, after the market closed. Here are some highlights from the video.
AMD reported record revenue of $4.3 billion, up 54% year over year (YoY) and 12% quarter over quarter (QoQ). The strength in growth is thanks to the strong demand for AMD's products overall. The computing and graphics segments saw a 44% YoY growth and 7% QoQ growth due to higher sales of its processors. The enterprise, embedded, and semi-custom segment saw a 69% YoY growth and a 20% QoQ growth due to its sixth straight quarter of record server processor sales.
During theearnings call CEO Lisa Su made three interesting remarks. One, AMD's data center GPU market is growing at solid levels, but it is still a small portion of revenue compared to the rest of its business. Two, server processor sales in China have not seen a slowdown, which is a different tone from what's being shared by AMD's competitors. Three, Milan, AMD's third-generation data center processor, is seeing more substantial adoption than previous generations.

2021-10-27 00:00:00+00:00,"Intel launches new PC chips, says U.S. supercomputer will double expected speeds",INTC,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/intel-launches-new-pc-chips-says-u.s.-supercomputer-will-double-expected-speeds-2021-10-27,,,"By Stephen Nellis
Oct 27 (Reuters) - Intel Corp INTC.O on Wednesday introduced a new, faster family of processor chips for personal computers and said that the supercomputer it is helping the U.S. government to build will reach double previously expected speeds.
Intel is working to regain its lead in making the fastest computing chips after having lost its title to rivals such as Advanced Micro Devices AMD.O and Apple Inc AAPL.O, both of which use outside partners to make their chips while Intel has struggled with its internal manufacturing operations. Santa Clara, California-based Intel made the announcement at an event aimed at persuading software developers to write code for its chips.
Intel showed versions of its 12th generation of Intel Core chips for PCs, known by their code name of Alder Lake. The company said the product line will eventually include 60 different chips destined for 500 models of PCs from various makers, from thin laptops to larger machines designed for gamers.
The company said it is shipping 28 versions of the chip to PC makers, with ""broad availability"" starting on Nov. 4.
Intel also said that Aurora, a supercomputer that Intel is building with the U.S. Department of Energy's Argonne National Laboratory for artificial intelligence work in suburban Chicago, will be twice as fast as originally planned. Intel said the computer will exceed 2 exaflops, meaning the ability to perform 2 quintillion - or 2,000,000,000,000,000,000 - calculations per second.
Intel had originally committed to deliver the $500 million computer this year with 1 exaflop of performance, but manufacturing delays forced it to postpone delivery until next year. In the meantime, Argonne officials tapped Intel's rivals Nvidia Corp NVDA.O and AMD for a smaller system built by Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co HPE.N as a test system to continue developing software technologies for the delayed machine.
