2021-05-15 00:00:00+00:00,3 Cathie Wood Stocks That Could Run Circles Around Dogecoin,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-cathie-wood-stocks-that-could-run-circles-around-dogecoin-2021-05-15,,,"Dogecoin (CRYPTO: DOGE) has become all the rage, rising as much as 12,000% this year. The cryptocurrency shed 25% of its value over the weekend, however, after Tesla CEO Elon Musk -- a big proponent of the digital coin -- joked about it with his mom on Saturday Night Live.
Even after its recent slump, the cryptocurrency is up more than 8,000% so far this year. At the same time, Cathie Wood has seen the returns of her five flagship ARK Investment Management exchange-traded funds (ETFs) struggle so far this year, as disruptive emerging technology stocks have fallen temporarily out of favor.
That doesn't necessarily mean that Dogecoin will outperform Wood's picks in the coming years. In fact, here are three stocks that are big holdings of the ARK funds that could outpace Dogecoin over the long term.

Roku: The future of television
By largely bypassing the content wars, Roku (NASDAQ: ROKU) has carved out a lucrative niche for itself in streaming video, and its prominence will only grow from here. In just a few short years, the company has emerged as the largest streaming platform in the U.S., with 53.6 million active accounts, surpassing Amazon's Fire TV with 50 million (at last count). Roku's engagement is also soaring, as streaming hours grew to 18.3 billion in the first quarter, up 49%. That works out to roughly 3 hours and 45 minutes per day per account.
The most recent earnings showed both the power of Roku's platform and its growing leverage. While revenue jumped an impressive 79% year over year, platform revenue -- which includes revenue from digital advertising, The Roku Channel, and the licensing of its operating system (OS) -- accelerated to 101%, notching its highest rate of growth since Q1, 2018. Additionally, gross profit margin for the platform segment has climbed in each of the previous four quarters, recently clocking in at 66.9%. Its average revenue per user (ARPU) continues to grow at a healthy clip, up 32% year over year.
Roku's secret weapon is its connected TV operating system that put the company within reach of nearly every household in North America. The Roku OS was integrated into 38% of smart TVs sold in the U.S. last year, while boasting a 31% market share in Canada.
The stock is a Top 10 holding of the ARK Next Generation Internet ETF (NYSEMKT: ARKW), coming in at No. 8, representing more than 3% of its $6.9 billion in funds under management.

MercadoLibre: A fintech leader in Latin America
While it's been called the Amazon, eBay, PayPal Holdings, and Square (NYSE: SQ) of Latin America, MercadoLibre (NASDAQ: MELI) has reproduced the best elements of each these internet and digital payments pioneers -- as well as many others. In doing so, it has become the leading provider of e-commerce services in the region and it's quickly becoming a fintech powerhouse.
MercadoLibre's most recent earnings report revealed a company that is truly firing on all cylinders. In Q1, it reported its fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year revenue growth in excess of 100%. Sales in local currencies climbed 158%, driven by online retail that surged 139% and fintech revenue that jumped 72%.
Any of its impressive growth metrics could have earned the company a spot among Cathie Wood's favorite stocks. Total payment volume (TPV) continued its relentless climb, up 129%, while the number of transactions grew 117%. TPV for its digital wallet grew 192%, while the value of its lending portfolio more than doubled. The platform is also expanding into investing.
The stock is a Top 10 holding in the ARK Fintech Innovation ETF (NYSEMKT: ARKF), grabbing the No. 6 position, representing 3.5% of its $4 billion in funds under management. MercadoLibre also represents about 1% of the $6.9 billion held in the ARK Next Generation Internet fund.

Square: Point-of-sale and so much more
There's no question that Square revolutionized point-of-sale systems for small- and medium-sized businesses with its namesake card reader that attaches to mobile devices, but that was just the beginning of the company's fintech journey.
The company continues to expand its ecosystem with both merchant- and consumer-friendly offerings. Cash App, Square's person-to-person funds transfer app -- which rivals PayPal's Venmo -- has been generating blockbuster growth. This is likely due to its expanding list of services, which now includes a free debit card and the ability to invest. In the first quarter, inflows of cash to the app reached their highest level ever, which signals its robust growth is continuing.
There's also a pretty compelling cryptocurrency connection. Since Square began offering members the opportunity to trade Bitcoin on its platform, adoption has soared. Square generated first-quarter revenue that grew 266%, with roughly 31% of that generated as the result of Bitcoin transactions. The underlying growth was more impressive, with a more than 10-fold increase in Bitcoin-related revenue.
Square is unquestionably one of Cathie Woods' favorite companies. ARK holds more than 7 million shares of the fintech giant across three portfolios, worth more than $1.55 billion. It's also the No. 1 holding in the ARK Fintech Innovation ETF and the No. 4 holding in both the ARK Next Generation Internet ETF and the ARK Innovation ETF (NYSEMKT: ARKK).

All joking aside
It's well documented that Dogecoin was created as a joke. The fact that some cryptocurrency investors are beginning to take it seriously, however, doesn't make it any less risky. Those wanting proof need look no further than the digital currency's 25% haircut last weekend -- all because Elon Musk and his mother joked about the cryptocurrency on Saturday Night Live. That alone highlights the tremendous risk for investors.
Even Dogecoin's co-creator, software developer Billy Markus, thinks the digital asset's value is ridiculous. ""The idea of Dogecoin being worth $0.08 is the same as GameStop being worth $325,"" Markus told The Wall Street Journal earlier this year. ""It doesn't make sense. It's super absurd. The coin design was absurd."" It's worth noting that GameStop stock and Dogecoin are now priced at roughly $145 and $0.46, respectively, as of this writing.
For those looking for something a little more substantial on which to base an investing thesis, these Cathie Wood stocks are fueled by robust, ongoing trends and have the potential to run circles around Dogecoin.

2021-05-14 00:00:00+00:00,Better Buy: Coinbase Global vs. Intercontinental Exchange,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/better-buy%3A-coinbase-global-vs.-intercontinental-exchange-2021-05-14,,,"A marketplace is one of the best business models to have. Once it is set up, a company can sit back and collect a small fee on every transaction. As long as the buyers and sellers continue showing up, there isn't a lot of investment required as activity grows. That means past a certain point, it's mostly profit.
It's worked for companies like eBay and Etsy in retail, and Coinbase (NASDAQ: COIN) and Intercontinental Exchange (NYSE: ICE) are putting the concept to work in the financial market. Let's dig deeper to discover which would make the better investment, the platform serving traditional financial interests or the one trying to establish a beachhead in the new crypto economy.
Image source: Getty Images.
The platform
Intercontinental Exchange operates marketplaces and provides data services and technology to corporations, government entities, and financial institutions. It offers trading and clearing of major asset classes like stocks, futures contracts, and bonds, as well as an end-to-end digital workflow for U.S. residential mortgages. The company now operates six financial clearinghouses, serving as an intermediary between buyers and sellers to validate and finalize transactions.
It was created to provide transparency and efficiency in the energy market and has expanded over the past two decades through new services and acquisitions. Purchases like the New York Board of Trade and NYSE Euronext expanded its offerings into commodities and futures, while the acquisition of Ellie Mae last year made it a leader in the mortgage market.
On the other end of the financial system is Coinbase, a company providing financial infrastructure and technology for the crypto economy. Over 96% of revenue comes from transaction fees from its more than 15 blockchain integrations and 223 crypto assets. The company has more than 56 million verified users, 11% representing institutions and the rest retail. Those institutions make up 64% of trading volume.
Coinbase continues to expand its offerings. In the first quarter, management launched an asset hub to help issuers of cryptocurrency integrate with its platform. It also expanded a loan product, allowing retail users to leverage their crypto holdings with a line of credit. As for the crypto ecosystem, management recently introduced a cloud-based service allowing companies to send, accept, and store crypto payments.
The business
Intercontinental Exchange benefits from activity regardless of the direction asset prices move. That is borne out by the past few years. Although revenue can be lumpy due to acquisitions, the three years prior to the pandemic averaged a modest 3.2% revenue growth and 13% earnings-per-share (EPS) growth. Between 2006 and 2019, the company delivered 17% compound annual EPS growth. Consistent profits allow the company to pay a dividend of $0.33 per quarter, a 1.2% yield. The payout may not be much, but it has grown 65% since 2017.
That consistency is occasionally disrupted by turbulent years. Revenue jumped 16% last year as uncertainty drove record volume. That growth is underlined by a 23% rise in the first quarter amid the market turmoil due to COVID-19. The elevated rate of growth is continuing so far in 2021. The company recently posted 15% growth for the first quarter.
With only a month of being public under its belt, it's unclear whether Coinbase will offer the same level of consistency. It certainly benefits from trading activity regardless of prices. Speculation in cryptocurrencies since last summer -- especially during the first quarter of 2021 -- has produced eye-popping growth. Revenue grew a robust 139% for fiscal 2020, but the first quarter of 2021 saw year-over-year revenue explode 843% higher. Trading volume for institutions actually grew almost 1,100%. That was a little faster than the 1,000% growth in retail trading volume.
Unlike Intercontinental Exchange, the future for Coinbase is largely unknown. Regulation or competition from traditional exchanges could curb growth. Of course, segments of the financial industry might continue migrating to the crypto economy, further accelerating the amount of assets on the platform. It already has 11.3% of crypto asset market share.
Uncertainty about which outcome is likelier will almost certainly lead to a lot of volatility in the stock price. Either way, Coinbase is building a portfolio of products and services that enable the proliferation of crypto assets. Management believes crypto could be as widely adopted and as revolutionary as the internet. With volume in the first quarter at levels 10 times last year's, they might be right.
The verdict
Both companies have robust marketplaces they are using to add services and grow revenue. Deciding which company is a better investment has a lot to do with what kind of investor is making the decision and their view of the global financial system.
Intercontinental Exchange is a way for investors to have low-risk exposure to traditional financial markets. It is growing methodically and returning profits to shareholders. On the other hand, Coinbase could represent the future. Even if it does, it's hard not to think the recent buzz about alternative digital currencies and promotional activity of celebrities is a bit overdone.
In many ways, the hype around the crypto economy may actually hinder its adoption by the mainstream financial establishment. With the businesses trading at close to the same market capitalization -- $53 billion for Coinbase and $63 billion for Intercontinental Exchange -- the safer bet seems like the right one in this comparison. If you are interested in a dominant marketplace facilitating financial transactions across broad swaths of the economy, buy the one that already fits that description, not the one hoping to.

2021-05-14 00:00:00+00:00,EXCLUSIVE-Personal finance startup NerdWallet files for U.S. IPO -sources,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/exclusive-personal-finance-startup-nerdwallet-files-for-u.s.-ipo-sources-2021-05-14,,,"By Anirban Sen and David French
May 14 (Reuters) - NerdWallet Inc, the owner of the eponymous consumer financial advice website, has confidentially submitted paperwork to U.S. regulators for an initial public offering (IPO), people familiar with the matter said on Friday.
NerdWallet has hired a group of investment banks, led by Morgan Stanley MS.N, to arrange the IPO and is aiming to go public before the end of the year, the sources said. The San Francisco-based company could seek a valuation of as much as $5 billion, two of the sources added.
The sources cautioned that the timing of the IPO and the valuation are subject to market conditions and asked not to be identified because the preparations are confidential.
NerdWallet and Morgan Stanley declined to comment.
A number of high-profile financial technology companies, such as Affirm Holdings Inc AFRM.O have gone public in the last six months, while others such as online brokerage Robinhood Markets Inc, Brazil's Nubank and financial services startup Chime are preparing to do so later this year.
Founded in 2009 by former hedge fund executive Tim Chen and Jake Gibson, a former trader at JPMorgan Chase JPM.N, NerdWallet provides financial guidance to users on credit cards, loans, mortgages and other financial products. It boasts more than 100 million users every year of its personal finance website and mobile phone app and counts venture capital firm IVF and SVB Financial Group SIVB.O among its investors.
NerdWallet has expanded rapidly over the past year through acquisitions of companies, including UK-based peer Know Your Money and New York City-based Fundera, which operates a marketplace for small businesses looking for loans.
In December, NerdWallet hired former eBay Inc EBAY.O executive Lauren St. Clair as its chief financial officer.

2021-05-13 00:00:00+00:00,Best Stocks To Invest In Right Now? 4 E-Commerce Stocks To Watch,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/best-stocks-to-invest-in-right-now-4-e-commerce-stocks-to-watch-2021-05-13,,,"4 Top E-commerce Stocks To Watch In The Stock Market Today
Lately, investing in the stock market can be a challenging task. But if you have got to bet on something, e-commerce stocks could be a good option in the long run. Now, why is that so? E-commerce allows businesses to reach out to customers in more ways than before. As time goes by, we will continue to see consumers migrating towards purchasing online for the sake of convenience and the ability to research products in real-time. On top of that, having an online store relinquishes the restrictions of set business hours and allows consumers to access its products and services at any given time. So it is safe to assume that this trend is here to stay and still growing in popularity.
We need to look no further than Booking Holdings Inc (NASDAQ: BKNG) to show how e-commerce has impacted our lives. Being the world leader in online travel, it provides customers all over the world easier and better access to travel planning and other services. Imagine how it changed how we plan our travels compared to several decades ago.
Now, consumers could go on to websites such as booking.com and Agoda to book their hotels or tour packages without the need of going to an actual travel agency. Now if you believe e-commerce is the future of commerce, then here are some of the top e-commerce stocks to watch in the stock market right now. 
Top E-Commerce Stock To Watch In May
Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (NYSE: BABA)
eBay Inc (NASDAQ: EBAY)
Shopify Inc (NYSE: SHOP)
Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN)
Alibaba Group Holding Ltd 
To start the list, we have one of the largest e-commerce companies in the world, Alibaba. Just as we have Amazon in the U.S., some consider Alibaba as the Amazon of China. Both companies have one thing in common, they are both tech-driven companies that have expanded beyond their core e-commerce divisions. The company is also one of the biggest venture capital firms with one of the biggest investment corporations in the world. Today, Alibaba announced its much-anticipated earnings report for the quarter and fiscal year ended March 31, 2021.
It has been a historic fiscal year for the company as it reached a milestone of 1 billion annual active users globally. Revenue came in 64% higher year over year to $28.6 billion. However, the company recorded a net loss of $1.16 billion. This can be attributed to the $2.8 billion fine levied by China’s State Administration for Market Regulation according to China’s Anti-monopoly Law. That aside, the overall business delivered strong growth on a healthy foundation.
In other news, Alibaba’s Taobao Live also announced in April that it would supercharge its ecosystem to yield further success for merchants and brands on the platform. It aims to support 2,000 live stream channels and 200 partners to significantly boost its sales. All things considered, would you invest in BABA stock with its current dip?

eBay Inc
Next up, we have the global commerce company, eBay. The company’s technology allows sellers worldwide to offer their inventory for sale, virtually anytime and anywhere. eBay’s platforms are accessible through a traditional online experience, mobile devices, and its application programming interfaces (APIs). Hence, consumers could easily access its platform as long as they have access to the internet. The company’s stock has been trading sideways since the start of the year. However, for those who invested a year ago, you would’ve seen a gain of over 40%. So could EBAY stock resume its upward trend moving forward?
Earlier this month, the company announced that there is a possibility of accepting cryptocurrency as a form of payment in the future. In addition, it is also looking at ways to get non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on its platform. The company is always looking at relevant forms of payment so that it doesn’t get left behind in this fast-paced world.
Fast forward a week later, the company finally hops on the NFT bandwagon. Consumers can now purchase NFTs on its broad online marketplace. This reflects an expansion of eBay’s digital collectibles business, in line with the increasing popularity of NFTs this year. With that in mind, would EBAY stock be a good buy now?

Shopify Inc 
Next up, we have Shopify. It is a multinational tech company with a focus on e-commerce. In detail, the company provides a cloud-based platform for small and medium-sized businesses to operate their digital storefronts. The Shopify platform provides merchants with a single view of their business and customers across all of their sales channels.
Hence allowing better management of their products and inventory, building customer relationships, and reporting all from one integrated back office. Late last month, the company announced its first-quarter earnings report and it crushed analyst’s expectations. 
Zooming in, the company posted revenue of $988.6 million, up by a whopping 110% compared with a year prior. On top of that, net income was boosted by a $1.3 billion unrealized gain on its investment in online payments company Affirm (NASDAQ: AFRM), which went public in January. As of the end of March, Shopify has extended a cumulative $2 billion of funds to merchants through Shopify Capital. This is to help boost its fast-growing merchant base through the help of machine learning. Therefore, with such impressive financial figures and innovation, would you buy SHOP stock now?

Amazon.com, Inc 
The last on this list requires no introduction. We have e-commerce giant Amazon. The company offers a range of products and services through its websites. This includes merchandise and content that it purchases for resale from vendors and those offered by third-party sellers. Also, it manufactures and sells electronic devices. AMZN stock has been on a dip since the start of the month after it reached an all-time high at the end of April. Well, this could be seen as a retracement and potentially a buying opportunity for investors who believe in the long-term success of the company. 
Despite being known for its e-commerce influence, the company has expanded its reach to other industries as well. For example, the company recently struck a multi-year deal with the Women’s National Basketball Association that will see several games streamed live on Prime Video. This is in addition to its earlier forays into streaming sports content like Thursday Night Football and the Premier League.
Financially, its first-quarter earnings report is as impressive as you would expect. Amazon posted revenues of $108.52 billion, an increase of 44% compared to the prior year. What is even more outstanding was its net income skyrocketing by 319%, up from $2.54 billion to $8.11 billion. So, with Amazon already being one of the biggest names in the market, coupled with its fantastic financial results, would this be a good time to bet on AMZN stock?

2021-05-13 00:00:00+00:00,2 Top E-Commerce Stocks to Buy in May,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/2-top-e-commerce-stocks-to-buy-in-may-2021-05-13,,,"The stock prices of both eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY) and Pinterest (NYSE: PINS) experienced noticeable declines following their first-quarter earnings reports released in late April. It's likely that the e-commerce companies lost some favor with investors over concerns about consumers returning to offline shopping amid the receding pandemic.
What these investors may not be aware of is that both of these companies that cater to online sellers have made changes to their businesses that could dramatically increase the likelihood of solid returns in the coming years, regardless of whether they have tailwinds from pandemic-related lockdowns.
1. eBay
Over the last few years, investors lost interest in eBay as high listing fees and a complicated platform led online sellers to turn to its competitors.
Image source: Getty Images.
That sense of slacking interest seemed to return following first-quarter earnings. Investors sold off amid a lackluster revenue forecast for the second quarter and the absence of any yearly projections.
Many e-commerce stocks have lost value lately as consumers have begun to shop more at brick-and-mortar stores. However, Grand View Research projects e-commerce will maintain a compound annual growth rate of 10% through 2028, indicating any near-term slowdown likely won't last.
More importantly for eBay, the return of Jamie Iannone to the company as CEO in early 2020 signaled a change of direction. Industry observers credit the former eBay executive with building successful platforms at Walmart in its Walmart eCommerce and Sam's Club segments.
Now, Iannone has made changes to eBay's site. As Iannone mentioned in the Q1 2021 earnings call, eBay has simplified the steps to post listings as well as added QR coding for more efficient delivery. eBay has also established its Managed Payments platform, a one-stop-shop that allows buyers to pay and sellers to receive payment on one site.
E-commerce has risen across the board, leading eBay to a 19% increase in revenue from year-ago levels for fiscal 2020. This is a dramatic shift for a company that experienced 1% revenue growth in 2019. Moreover, the increases continued as revenue surged 42% compared with the same quarter last year.
The higher revenue helped lead to $569 million in GAAP net income for the first quarter as well as $855 million in free cash flow for the period. That enabled eBay to return $414 million to shareholders, and debt levels of approximately $7 billion fell by about $800 million from year-ago levels.
eBay stock price surged by about 45% over the last 12 months. Still, with a P/E ratio of 15, it dramatically lags the valuations of other e-commerce giants such as Amazon and Walmart. While eBay may not offer the fastest growth in e-commerce, the consumer discretionary stock may well provide the most growth for the money.

2. Pinterest
Originally a site designed for ""pinning"" the latest trends, Pinterest has become increasingly valuable in the e-commerce realm. The company claims about 478 million monthly active users (MAUs), and 80% of weekly Pinners, as it calls its users, discover a new brand on the site. Also, since 45% of its Pinners in the U.S. earn over $100,000 per year, it unites ideas with buyers with disposable income.
It also stands out by focusing on ideas rather than the social connections that bolster Facebook or Twitter. Since it focuses on concepts, the site can apply a user's inspiration to directly link merchants. In other words, if users find items they would like to buy, Pinterest can link them with merchants offering those products.
In 2020, this strategy helped revenue surge 48% from last year's levels to almost $1.7 billion. This growth accelerated in the most recent quarter as revenue climbed to $485 million, a 78% increase from the same quarter last year. In comparison, the cost of revenue rose around 34%, while operating expenses climbed by about 22%. This helped Pinterest cut its quarterly loss to $22 million, down from $141 million in the same quarter last year.
Despite the loss, Pinterest generated $269 million in free cash flow during the quarter. Since it now holds about $2.1 billion in liquidity, this cash allows it to cover expenses and invest further in the business.
Nonetheless, despite these cash flows and a Q2 projection of 105% revenue growth, Pinterest did not offer any full-year predictions for fiscal 2021. The expected resurgence of in-store shopping leaves Pinterest's revenue growth in a precarious state in the near term. Hence, Pinterest, like most of its peers, has not published forecasts beyond the upcoming quarter.
This has led to the stock price falling significantly following earnings. However, even with the drop, Pinterest's stock price has risen by almost 200% over the last 12 months. Although it now sells for around 19 times sales, it sells for much less than Shopify's sales multiple of 39.
PINS data by YCharts
This could motivate some buyers to take advantage of Pinterest's post-earnings plunge. Although the near-term uncertainty may trouble many investors, Pinterest continues to invest in site improvements, advertiser engagement, and content. These upgrades and the strong user engagement should help Pinterest drive long-term profit increase from its core competency -- turning ideas into sales.

2021-05-13 00:00:00+00:00,"With Record Earnings, Again, Why Isn't Etsy Stock Popping?",EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/with-record-earnings-again-why-isnt-etsy-stock-popping-2021-05-13,,,"As shopping went digital, Etsy (NASDAQ: ETSY) was one of the pandemic's biggest winners. Millions discovered the online marketplace that connected artisans making customized, handmade goods with creative buyers.
Not surprisingly, Etsy was one of the biggest growth stocks, gaining more than 300% in 2020. The stock had been on a similar trajectory this year until the earnings report came out last week. Shares are down nearly 13% since, however the big question is, why did the stock drop?
Another record quarter
Business-wise, everything for the first Etsy posted its third consecutive quarter of year-over-year triple-digit sales and gross merchandise sales (GMS) growth, and it's gotten higher each time.
Image source: Getty Images.
In the 2021 first quarter, GMS increased 132% to $3.1 billion, and revenue increased 142% to $550 million. Net income grew over 1,000% to $144 million, take rate -- the fee charged by Etsy for transactions, or simply its total revenue divided by total GMS -- increased to 17.5%, and there were 16 million new or reactivated active buyers for a total of 90 million, a 91% year-over-year increase.
The company released its 2020 sellers census along with the earnings report, which illustrated the effect of the pandemic. 2 million new sellers joined, nearly doubling the total to 4.4 million, and 44% of those who joined did so because of the pandemic. Two-thirds said they maintained or grew sales during the pandemic.
So what's the problem?
Despite the fantastic results, Etsy stock dropped after the report. That's because CFO Rachel Glaser gave underwhelming guidance for the second quarter.
The company expects 15% to 25% revenue growth over Q2 2020, 5% to 15% GMS growth, and adjusted EBITDA of $129 million to $144 million, which is a decrease year over year. It also expects new customer acquisition to slow down. It faces headwinds from a pickup in non-retail spending, and it won't have the tailwind of stimulus checks, which were a significant factor in the first-quarter sales increase. According to Etsy's estimates, they accounted for 8% of GMS in Q1, and April and May sales already demonstrate the lack of stimulus spending.
Glaser tried to paint a positive picture, noting that the expected increases in sales and GMS keep all of the progress from the pandemic, and that's an important point to keep in mind. But since more than a third of Q2 has already passed, this is more than a prediction, making it likely that the actual numbers will fall in line with expectations.
She also noted that two-year stacked guidance shows a 170% increase in Q2, a slight decrease from 207% in the first quarter. Not too shabby.
Some positive signs for the future
As usual, habitual buyers was the fastest-growing cohort, increasing more than 200% to 8 million. There are shoppers who really love Etsy, and the company is working to convert more shoppers into that cohort. This is especially important as it anticipates new customer count to decelerate.
The company has a strong set of data points that it's using to strategize new ideas, such as improved search results and alerts when a product a customer has looked at goes on sale. It's laser-focused on the user experience, which is the key to unlocking more value from each customer.
CEO Josh Silverman noted that the company has a similar number of unique monthly visitors as online furniture retailer Wayfair, but only a third of the number of eBay, which has a broader product selection, like Etsy. It has work to do, and it's experiencing some growing pains.
But there are still reasons to be optimistic about the future. Despite the slowdown in retail, e-commerce is taking a stronger hold on shopping than was originally anticipated post-pandemic. For example, PayPal Holdings raised its outlook after beating internal guidance for the first quarter.
And Etsy's story hasn't changed. It provides a unique service that reaches millions of customers at all price points, with a lean, platform-based model.
Where does that leave shareholders?
I've been touting Etsy as a top growth stock for the past few months, and I think it still has a lot of future potential. The stock drop was based on low confidence, not any actual numbers, which is often what drives stock in the short run. But even if growth slows down, there's a lot of opportunity long term. The lower stock price is slightly down year to date, making this a great entry point for investors who have been on the fence.

2021-05-11 00:00:00+00:00,7 Undervalued Stocks to Snap Up While You Can,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/7-undervalued-stocks-to-snap-up-while-you-can-2021-05-11,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
In a sense, adding undervalued stocks to one’s portfolio is the ultimate contrarian move. That’s simply because what is contrary is inherently unpopular. It is often en vogue to move toward flashy, attractive growth stocks. The market bore witness to this phenomenon over the past year. Growth stocks garnered massive attention and investment evidenced by the rise of electronic vehicles (EVs) particularly, and speculative investment vehicles including special-purpose acquisition companies (SPACs).
The truth is that it can be harder to criticize growth stock investment. When growth stocks catch on, those with positions therein tend to look brilliant. Undervalued stocks on the other hand catch a lot of flak for being boring and overly conservative. So the argument here is that in choosing to seek value now is a contrarian move. 
I probably can’t convince readers that undervalued stocks are sexy, but it is important to consider stability. Value stocks weather the ups and downs better than their growth counterparts.

And in the turbulent economy that we’re all dealing with it is arguably more important than ever to find stability. That said, let’s get into a few undervalued stocks that really deserve your attention right now. If these stocks are truly undervalued, then the market is wrong and investors will look very smart indeed.

Undervalued stocks: Alibaba (BABA)

I’ve been keen on Alibaba over the last few weeks in spite of, or perhaps because of the trouble it is facing. The Chinese government levied a record $2.8 billion fine against one of its own dominant e-commerce forces in Alibaba on April 9. Shares jumped up immediately following the news. That seemed odd, but the logic was that the worst was behind the company with a $2.8 billion fine, a mere drop in the bucket given the company’s revenues. Share prices have come back down and are now at the same levels they were prior to the fine being announced. 
That’s why I’d argue that now represents a moment in which Alibaba is undervalued and attractive. Investors who look at Alibaba from the perspective of a traditional value determinant like price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio may miss the point. After all, BABA stock carries a P/E ratio of 25.6, worse than about 57% of competitors. 
Make no mistake though, Alibaba share prices will rise again taking that P/E ratio higher. But it won’t matter because Alibaba is essentially one of a kind. That’s why I’d argue that its P/E ratio is somewhat irrelevant. The company’s revenues increased nearly 30% in 2020, which is far more important than temporary headwinds. 
KeyCorp (KEY)

A few weeks ago, on April 20, KeyCorp reported first-quarter earnings. Fortunately, they were strong. The company announced that net income attributable to shareholders increased to a record $591 million in the quarter. KeyCorp reported EPS of 61 cents per share. Both of these figures exceeded those from the previous quarter at $549 million net income, and a 56 cent EPS. 
That difference was strong in and of itself. However, looking back at the year-over-year growth tells an even more compelling story. In Q1 2020, KeyCorp reported a net income of $118 million and a corresponding EPS of 12 cents. 

7 Stocks to Buy Right Now With All Eyes on Crypto
While the growth is undeniably a good thing, it does represent a bit of a double-edged sword for investors currently. KEY stock now trades at a higher price than in the past few years. Its P/E ratio puts it in the middle of the pack relative to other banks. I’d ignore that along with the historically high price as well. The company’s growth will attract investment as more learn about it. Those who establish a position now will benefit from that. 
Undervalued stocks: Barrick Gold (GOLD)

To be completely honest, Barrick Gold is pretty much fairly valued. Investors who consider the company’s P/E, price-to-book (P/B), and price-to-sales (P/S) ratios — three common value metrics — will see it trades where it should. 
What then makes it “undervalued?” That is, what about this stock is the market missing, and why should it actually be trading higher? The company’s name, stock ticker, and business sector should make that obvious. GOLD stock is a play against inflation and a bet that the shiny commodity metal can serve as a buffer. 
Barrick Gold is not a household name, but it is a major force in the gold sector. It produced 4.76 billion ounces of gold in 2020. That was second only to Newmont (NYSE:NEM) and its 5.91 billion ounces. 
The company is debt free. That’s a clear financial strength for any company to possess. From a profitability perspective, Barrick Gold really deserves a bit more love. Its operating margin, net margin, return on equity, and return on assets all rank well above the 80th percentile of metals and mining peers. 
Barrick Gold also either owns, or has interest in 6 of the 13 mines in the world that have the capacity to produce 500,000 ounces of gold annually at below average operating costs. Even if investors weren’t looking at gold in light of inflationary concerns, Barrick Gold would be worth strongly considering. 
Intel (INTC)

In the summer of 2020 the main headline regarding Intel was that it had been overtaken by Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) as the world’s most valuable chipmaker. According to pundits, Intel was dead in the water and smart investors ought to pile into Nvidia or AMD (NASDAQ:AMD). 
The truth is, Nvidia remains the more valuable company from a market capitalization perspective. While Intel’s market cap sits at $223 billion, Nvidia is worth $356 billion. AMD sits at a relatively small $93 billion in market cap. 
However, the fact also remains that investors are simply willing to pay more, much more, for a dollar of Nvidia’s earnings than they are for a dollar of Intel’s earnings. Nvidia’s P/E ratio sits at 82.7, while Intel carries a very low 12.96 P/E ratio. 
Yes, Nvidia has cornered the market for desktop gaming CPUs and GPUs. However, Intel remains a force to be reckoned with and the true contrarian will disregard the negative headlines and consider its chances moving forward.

Undervalued stocks: eBay (EBAY)

eBay seems to be perpetually undervalued. Investors who look back at its performance over the past few years will see that it certainly hasn’t received the love that some of its more prominent ecommerce peers have. I’m largely referring to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) here. While this isn’t perhaps fair, the two firms are intertwined as early American e-commerce success stories. 
It’s clear that investors are much more interested in AMZN stock than EBAY stock based on the traditional P/E ratio as a measure of value. Amazon sits at about 62.57, and eBay, 16.21. Thus, Amazon is about four times as attractive. Anyway, enough of the comparison because eBay is attractive in its own right.
Recently announced earnings validate that idea. Revenues increased by 42%, to $3 billion in Q1. Further, eBay saw strong growth in its customer base. Annual active buyers grew 7%, to 187 million customers. And annual active sellers grew 8%, to 20 million. eBay expects that its revenue figures in Q2 will be similar to the $3 billion it recorded in Q1. If that is indeed the case, eBay will grow on a Q2 year-over-year basis of about 9%. 
So, if eBay continues on this trajectory, it’s hard to imagine that investors won’t soon give it some love. 
Verizon (VZ)

There’s a lot for investors to like about Verizon as an underappreciated stock. From a high-level perspective the company looks reasonable as a 5G play. The markets have hyped up 5G buildout in the U.S., and indeed there will be massive windfalls to be had. Verizon is almost always a part of that conversation as a data provider consumers know as a household name. 
Earlier in the year Verizon made a heavy investment to secure its spot as a leader in the 5G revolution. The U.S. government held a spectrum auction in February in which $81 billion worth of airwave rights were sold. Verizon spent $45.5 billion in that auction, securing midrange spectrum rights. 
Part of the reason Verizon was so willing to spend so much was the T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) Sprint merger in 2020. Verizon simply understood the land grab opportunities present in the auction. 

8 Blue-Chip Stocks With Strong Earnings
This win represents a big part of the narrative behind a Verizon investment. Yet, VZ stock remains discounted. Its P/E ratio of under 13 is quite low. Roughly three-quarters of the telecommunications industry can garner more money for a dollar of their earnings. But that’s the contrarian play here. Investors who follow the narrative that Verizon is undervalued will also be purchasing a stock with a nice dividend. Verizon’s quarterly dividend carries a 4.22% yield at 63 cents. 
Undervalued stocks: Toyota (TM)

I’d be willing to bet that most readers have a certain image of Toyota. The brand is associated with reliability and longevity. I’d argue that it’s one of the best companies in the world and that its conservative stance is attractive. However, conservative companies which build vanilla vehicles tend not to inspire the market. 
That’s fine. It’s a good part of the reason that Toyota carries P/E and P/B ratios that are lower than two-thirds of the automotive sector. 
I’d argue that Toyota ticks many of the boxes that automotive investor dollars have flooded into of late. Yet, the market hasn’t caught on to the value Toyota presents. 
Toyota announced it will have 70 electrified vehicles in its lineup by 2025. Of course EVs were all the rage in 2020, much of which has settled. But Toyota is an established name in EVs and it’s safe to say that it will be producing EVs for decades to come. By that time, a good number of 2020’s SPAC EVs will be dustbin relics. 
Another often discussed automotive technology is solid state EV batteries. While QuantumScape (NYSE:QS) garnered massive headline space recently, Toyota has quietly plodded along with its own battery development. There is good reason to believe that it will bring a solid state battery EV to market before any other manufacturer does. I believe that Toyota remains undervalued due to its staid, conservative nature. Perhaps it will pay to view it differently.

2021-05-11 00:00:00+00:00,"Airbnb Looks Expensive, but Game-Changing Business Model Renders Most Metrics Useless",EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/airbnb-looks-expensive-but-game-changing-business-model-renders-most-metrics-useless-2021,,,"Traditional valuation metrics indicate that home rental pioneer Airbnb (NASDAQ: ABNB) is a vastly overpriced stock with an unfavorable risk/reward profile. At about 17 times estimated revenue for this year, Airbnb isn't going to land on many value investors' desks. The picture doesn't improve when the stock is stacked up against rivals in the online travel booking space, such as VRBO owner Expedia, which is trading at less than four times expected sales.

For many, the valuation story ends there, with Airbnb's nose-bleed price-to-sales metric putting the stock well out of investors' comfort zones. I believe this may be a monumental mistake, however, since common valuation measures fail to capture the long-term growth potential of a game-changing company like Airbnb.
Couple walking past an outdoor pool together.
Revolutionizing a massive industry
Airbnb represents an opportunity to invest in a groundbreaking company that's reshaping a travel and experience market valued at a staggering $3.4 trillion, according to the company's IPO prospectus.

By creating an entirely new way to travel and vacation, Airbnb has exponentially expanded accommodation and destination possibilities. Simultaneously, its platform provides a convenient way for people to earn extra cash by renting out their homes.
I'm not suggesting that Airbnb will completely wipe out the hotel industry the way that Netflix erased Blockbuster Video, but companies like Marriott and Hilton are feeling the heat. Marriott's foray into the rental home market in 2019 through its Home & Villas unit is a direct response to the increasing threat posed by Airbnb.
In March 2019, Bloomberg Second Measure reported that 12% of major hotel customers in 2018 also made a booking with Airbnb, compared to only 1% in 2013. This willingness of travelers to step outside the boundaries of traditional lodging is also revealed in Airbnb's substantial market share. The same report from Second Measure estimated that Airbnb nabbed nearly 20% of all U.S. consumer spending on lodging in 2018. This puts the company well ahead of HomeAway's estimated 11% market share, but it also leaves room to keep chipping away at the combined 70% market share held by all major hotel operators.
This data is a bit stale, but Airbnb has only strengthened its position over the past two years with the pandemic shining a light on its rising popularity.
Resiliency points to growing acceptance for non-traditional stays
As the pandemic pummeled the travel industry last year, the timing of Airbnb's December 2020 IPO seemed less than ideal. Indeed, the company was not immune to the effects of the virus as gross booking value (GBV) dove by 39% to $18.0 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2020.
The steep downturn cast a shadow over a stellar 2019, when 54 million active bookers and 2.9 million hosts (4 million as of the end of 2020) helped drive a 29% year-over-year jump in GBV to $37.9 billion.
However, the pandemic shed light on a quality that I believe will translate into strong growth and market share gains as a reopening economy helps unwind pent-up travel demand: resiliency.
Revenue, which represents the cut that Airbnb takes from a booking, was down only 30% in 2020. In comparison, revenue declines from hotel operators Marriott, Hilton, and Hyatt, ranged from 50-60%, while online bookings companies Expedia and Booking.com saw revenue decreases of 67% and 55%, respectively.
Some may argue that this isn't an apples-to-apples comparison since Airbnb's exposure to the harder-hit business travel space is much lighter. That is a fair point, but the work-from-anywhere shift that emanated during the pandemic dovetails nicely with Airbnb's ability to offer safer accommodations in nearby destinations.
While 2020 was a very difficult year for Airbnb, it's relative top-line outperformance implies that momentum will resume and that an increasing number of people will use its platform due to its wider variety of lodging options for shorter, localized trips relative to hotel chains.
Underestimating game-changers can be very costly
Despite this bullish picture, some may still question how much upside potential could exist for a seemingly expensive stock like Airbnb.
To address that question, let's take a look at two other very prominent companies that revolutionized massive industries: Facebook and PayPal.
When Facebook went public in May 2012, its $38 IPO pricing resulted in a trailing price/sales of 28x. At the time, many pundits and investors balked at the sky-high valuation. Nine years later, Facebook is trading near $330, good for a spectacular 750% gain.
Similarly, PayPal's rich valuation was a hot topic of conversation after the company was spun-off by eBay in 2015. While underestimating the FinTech leader's growth potential, many focused on the fact that PayPal was valued at about 60% of eBay at the time of the spin-off, despite generating less than 50% of eBay's total annual revenue. Investors would have done well to ignore the critics as the stock has rocketed higher by 560% since the spin-off.

Perhaps Airbnb ultimately doesn't match the astronomical gains achieved by Facebook and PayPal. In my view, though, the potential long-term rewards of investing in a pioneer like Airbnb far outweighs the perceived risks associated with its lofty price/sales metric.

May 11 (Reuters) - Ebay Inc EBAY.Oon Tuesday allowed the sale of non-fungible tokens for digital collectibles like trading cards, images or video clips on its platform, the first e-commerce company to tap into the recent frenzy around NFTs.
NFTs, virtual assets that exist on a blockchain ledger, have exploded in popularity this year, as enthusiasts spend enormous sums of money on artwork and other items that exist only online, with some selling for tens of millions of dollars recently at auction houses Christie's and Sotheby's.
While multi-million dollar deals, including the $69 million sale of a digital artwork by Beeple in March, have created ripples in the art world, a market for digital collectibles such as NFT trading cards, images or video clips have also thrived alongside.
These could range from something like Kurt Cobain's last photoshoot to historic moments from NBA games. While anyone can view the NFTs for free, the buyer has the status of being the official owner - a kind of digital bragging rights.
In the short term, an NFT inventory will be provided to sellers who meet eBay's standards, the company told Reuters, adding that users can expect to see programs, policies and tools in future that will let them buy and sell NFTs across a broader range of categories.
""In the coming months, eBay will add new capabilities that bring blockchain-driven collectibles to our platform,"" said Jordan Sweetnam, senior vice president and general manager for eBay's North America market.
The announcement comes after eBay said last week it was open to the possibility of accepting cryptocurrency as a form of payment in the future and was looking at ways to get NFTs on its platform.
NFTs are usually bought with the cryptocurrency ether or in dollars and the blockchain keeps a record of transactions.

If you thought Wall Street was craving a hot stock market, it doesn’t hold a candle to the crypto market’s Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD). But is ETH still a good purchase? Let’s take a look at what’s happening in ETH both off and on the price chart, then offer a risk-adjusted determination aligned with those findings.

The Dow Jones just finished another strong week. Buoyed by strong weekly gains in constituents Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT), Nike (NYSE:NKE), Home Depot (NYSE:HD) and others, the blue-chip average jumped more than 2.50%.
The Dow posted record highs while seeing its year-to-date return grow by more than 13%. To say the least, the performance is historically impressive. But not compared to what the market for Ethereum has been up to in 2021.
Ethereum Makes a Shift
Ethereum or ETH for shorthand. It’s been called the world’s computer of digital assets. It’s largely played the role of second banana to Bitcoin’s (CCC:BTC-USD) popularity during the crypto bubble a few years back.
But in 2021, there’s been a disruptive shift within this emerging market that’s helping ETH take on newfound significance with investors of all kinds.
7 Stocks to Buy Right Now With All Eyes on Crypto
In recent weeks and while BTC has largely languished, Ethereum exploded higher. The price of ETH surged more than 90% over the last month to record highs and jumped 460% in 2021. By comparison, BTC is up just 3.60% in the past 30 days and flirting with a return of 100% on the year.
And not to complicate matters, Ethereum Classic is up more than 250% in just one month’s time and more than 2,000 in 2021!
So, what gives? Part of investors’ newfound enthusiasm for ETH is its decentralized finance or (DeFi) applications. While not unique to Ethereum, outspoken billionaire and Mavericks owner Mark Cuban thinks its blockchain technology has the strongest functionality. And if the street savvy businessman is correct once more, eventually, Ethereum’s smart contracts should overshadow Bitcoin’s use.
The Rise of NFTs
But another part of the token’s relative strength that can’t be overlooked is a fast-growing twist on ETH’s technology used to create one-of-a-kind non-fungible tokens or NFTs.
NFTs? Think of NFTs as unique, digital properties comprised of video, audio and other files stored on the Ethereum’s digital-ledger technology. It’s akin to digital art. And as NFT’s gain popularity, the more Ether tokens are in demand. More importantly, understand that some NFTs have already changed hands, digitally of course, for tens of millions of dollars.
Bottom line, major players from the NBA are hawking digital trading cards. Meanwhile, eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) is looking to cash in on this trend. And the New York Stock Exchange creating NFTs celebrating historic debuts. These include Spotify (NYSE:SPOT), the market’s first-ever direct listing, or this past year’s prominent DoorDash (NYSE:DASH) IPO. The reverberations, more than Opening Bell ceremonies, sound long-lasting.
Weekly Price Chart of an Ethereum Proxy

Source: Charts by TradingView
Hoop dreams or slam dunk? One listed spot where Ethereum’s ups and downs can be viewed and traded in regular brokerage accounts is Grayscale Ethereum Classic Trust (OTCMKTS:ETCG). And over the past month, it’s become the de-facto leader within the ETH market with a gain of 300%.
But today that move comes with elevated risk.
To state the obvious, investors are interested in ETH and even more so in ETCG of late. Technically and in the short-term at least, the ultra-volatile price action has put shares in a dicey position despite a hard-hitting violent price reversal to finish the week.
This past Friday, the ETH proxy plummeted 37%. The dramatic selloff took shares into a test of ETCG’s 50% retracement level tied to a bottom from October and for all intents and purposes, it’s all-time-low.
Bulls Counterattack
Monday has seen a counterattack by bulls with a gap bid of about 15% that’s mostly wedged in-between ETCG’s prior bubble high and 38% Fibonacci support. But I wouldn’t be so quick to think or see the worst as being over.
The odds are today’s bid is mostly faster money operators trying to cash in on bargain-hunting. But given shares of ETH play remain well-above its weekly Bollinger Band and stochastics has entered overbought territory, I’d be inclined to wait for additional testing and for ETCG’s extreme secondary conditions to cool off further before making a play on this Ethereum stock.

2021-05-10 00:00:00+00:00,Is eBay Stock a Buy?,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/is-ebay-stock-a-buy-2021-05-10,,,"eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY) had been a somewhat stagnant player in the e-commerce realm for the past few years, but it sprang back to life this past year amid a sudden interest in e-commerce during the coronavirus pandemic and a new CEO that took over in April 2020. Now, some investors wonder if the transformation will continue and what it will mean for the company's stock.
Admittedly, eBay could again languish in the near term as consumers begin to put the pandemic behind them and return to offline shopping. What eBay investors are asking is not necessarily what happens in the next few quarters, but whether management has leveraged the sales surge in 2020 to place itself on a long-term growth path.
The reemergence of eBay
Once a darling of the 1990s tech boom, interest in eBay fell in the 2000s as high fees, free listings on competing sites, and a platform many found difficult to use led to a loss of interest in the company and the stock. Moreover, the fact that one-time subsidiary PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL) quickly became significantly larger than eBay following its public spinoff did not help its reputation. Despite its more recent improvements, PayPal supports a market cap more than seven times larger than that of eBay.
Image source: Getty Images.
However, two factors have bolstered eBay over the last year. First, the lockdown effects brought on by COVID-19 meant online shopping benefited across the board as millions were asked to temporarily not shop in most stores. Second, Jamie Iannone was offered the CEO position. Iannone was a former eBay executive who began e-commerce initiatives at Walmart (NYSE: WMT) eCommerce and Sam's Club.
In his CEO role at eBay, Iannone has pushed what he described in the first-quarter 2021 earnings call as a ""tech-led reimagination"" of eBay. That led to redesigns of the website and the overall sales process. For example, he added QR coding to packing slips for more rapid pick-ups. Iannone also made it easier to list items on eBay. Features such as image-based listings reduced the time to list items by up to 75%.
eBay has also simplified digital payment through its Managed Payments platform. Buyers now have most of the more widely used digital wallets available to them. Hence, credit, debit, and PayPal are no longer the only payment options, and users will no longer be required to have a separate PayPal account. Additionally, eBay's system now manages claims and return processes on one platform. These changes have streamlined the sales process for both buyers and sellers.
How changes affected eBay's finances
The changing sales environment and the site improvements dramatically altered the financial outlook. In 2020, revenue increased 19% from the previous year while GAAP net income surged 68%.
In comparison, Walmart's e-commerce sales rose 79% in 2020, amid 9% overall revenue growth. In the same period, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) reported 39% higher net sales (not including Amazon Web Services) in 2020. While eBay lagged its much larger rivals on e-commerce revenue growth, investors should also remember that eBay reported a 1% revenue increase in 2019 before Iannone took the helm.
Driven by a record gross merchandise volume of more than $27 billion, revenue in the first quarter of 2021 climbed 42% compared with the year-ago quarter. Moreover, eBay's GAAP net income rose to $569 million. This is a 32% surge from the same quarter last year when excluding a one-time, $3.1 billion boost from discontinued operations in 2020.
The income growth allowed eBay to generate $855 million in free cash flow during the quarter, a 65% increase from the same quarter last year. This helped the company cover $117 million in interest costs and $122 million in dividend payments. eBay can also more easily manage its debts as total debt levels fell from just under $7.8 billion a year ago to around $6 billion today.
Investors have taken notice, and even after a recent decline, eBay's stock price is up by just over 45% in the last 12 months. And although the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio has climbed above the single digits, the earnings multiple of 14 keeps the valuation well under Walmart's P/E ratio of 30 and the 62 earnings multiple of e-commerce giant Amazon.
EBAY data by YCharts
Nonetheless, the financials point to possible near-term struggles. The company's quarterly revenue projection of about $3 billion for the second quarter would amount to an approximate 3% increase over 12 months. Moreover, it did not make any yearly projections. Though many other e-commerce companies also refuse to release full-year forecasts, it speaks to the uncertainty surrounding that industry as consumers return to more offline shopping options.
Will eBay sustain its growth?
Despite the near-term doubts, the actions eBay took during the pandemic may warrant new investments. Indeed, as the pandemic wanes and society reopens, it could temporarily slow sales. But consumers were trending toward more shopping online more even before the pandemic. Iannone's approach has made eBay's site more user-friendly, increasing the likelihood that it will become more popular for sellers and buyers even with the pandemic's end.
This does not mean eBay will necessarily match the revenue increases of retail giants like Walmart (which is still early in its e-commerce transition and growing at a faster rate) or Amazon (which has always been a juggernaut and shows no signs of slowing). Nonetheless, at a P/E ratio of 14, this consumer discretionary stock still has some significant growth in it and is currently priced for value.

2021-05-06 00:00:00+00:00,Coupang Is an E-Commerce Company Worth Your Attention,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/coupang-is-an-e-commerce-company-worth-your-attention-2021-05-06,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
There has been an uptick in U.S. macro-economic risk in the past few weeks. Issues such as potential inflation and an increase in taxes could bring down stocks in the broader U.S. market in the future. So, given these recent increases in United States-specific risks, investors should consider diversifying their holdings by buying international stocks. Coupang (NYSE:CPNG) and CPNG stock could be one such solution.
Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com
A recent initial public offering (IPO), Coupang is a good choice for investors given the fact that it’s a high-growth company in the lucrative South Korean e-commerce market. And, after a massive price increase post-IPO, CPNG stock has come back down. This gives investors an opportunity to scoop up some shares.
Today, the stock trades for a little under $40. Here’s why you should consider it as a potential buy.
Coupang Is Growing Fast in a Competitive Market
The South Korean e-commerce industry is highly competitive, with no company having a dominant position. Of course, this is unlike the U.S., where Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is by far the largest and most dominant while other players occupy niche spaces.
For South Korea, though, there are multiple online retail market players due to a lower barrier to entry. The logistics infrastructure in the country is well-developed and residential areas are much denser. This allows players to enter the market without the need for heavy capital expenditures. Apart from Coupang, other major industry players include Naver Shopping, Gmarket (which is owned by Ebay (NASDAQ:EBAY)), Wemakeprice and TMON.

7 Hot Stocks to Consider for a Greener Future
However, economies of scale will eventually give an advantage to larger companies. Therefore, investors should look out for the names that are starting to take more and more market share. I believe Coupang could fill this role in Korean e-commerce. In 2020, it was the only South Korean player with a “sizable gain in market share,” growing from 18.1% in 2019 to 24.6%.
On top of this, Coupang grew its total revenues to $12 billion last year, a 93% increase year-over-year (YOY). This coincided with the growth of its active customer base by nearly 26%, from 11.8 million in 2019 to 14.8 million. As such, the company’s growth wasn’t primarily due just to increased usage and order value but also to a healthy increase in users.
Like across most of the world, the Covid-19 pandemic has accelerated the long-term trend of e-commerce in Korea. This means that the total addressable market (TAM) for e-commerce has grown substantially in 2020. South Korea has a well-developed market most recently valued at $90.1 billion. Plus, that number is expected to continue growing at a 12% compound annual growth rate (CAGR). Because of that, it seems there are plenty of revenue opportunities ahead for Coupang.
Certain Competitive Advantages
There are more reasons to like CPNG stock, however — namely, the specific factors that will help it increase its market share.
I believe Coupang has certain advantages that could allow it to win over the long term. For example, the company has an integrated e-commerce and logistics system that allows for a superior customer experience.
Part of Coupang’s “Rocket Delivery” service includes same-day delivery for certain fresh items and next-day delivery for almost all of its orders. It also includes pick-up for return items. Altogether, the company claims to have the fastest delivery service in the Korean e-commerce market.
CPNG’s key competitive advantage is its strong logistics network. The company’s “operational infrastructure spans over 25 million square feet across over 30 cities.” This puts 70% of the population within seven miles of a Coupang logistics center.
Moreover, Coupang can continuously build upon this logistics advantage, such as by expanding into areas like food delivery. The company’s existing food delivery service, Coupang Eats, currently accounts for “17.1 percent of the food delivery market.”
Investor Takeaway
All in all, Coupang could be great for investors looking for a high-growth company that’s unaffected by U.S.-specific issues. Plus, this company is even more attractive because its management is continuously innovating to improve customer experience. CPNG has been growing rapidly these last few years. I don’t think there’s reason to believe it will stop anytime soon.
CPNG stock hasn’t taken off yet, but it’s becoming clear that this name is solidifying its position in the Korean e-commerce market. I consider this stock a buy.

2021-05-06 00:00:00+00:00,Interesting EBAY Put And Call Options For June 25th,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/interesting-ebay-put-and-call-options-for-june-25th-2021-05-06,,,"Investors in eBay Inc. (Symbol: EBAY) saw new options begin trading today, for the June 25th expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the EBAY options chain for the new June 25th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $58.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.75. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $58.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $56.25 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of EBAY, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $58.44/share today.
Because the $58.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 100%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 3.02% return on the cash commitment, or 22.03% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for eBay Inc., and highlighting in green where the $58.00 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $59.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.39. If an investor was to purchase shares of EBAY stock at the current price level of $58.44/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $59.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 3.34% if the stock gets called away at the June 25th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if EBAY shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for eBay Inc., as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing EBAY's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $59.00 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $59.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 2.38% boost of extra return to the investor, or 17.36% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.
Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $58.44) to be 35%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

2021-05-06 00:00:00+00:00,3 Things to Know From eBay's Latest Earnings Report,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-things-to-know-from-ebays-latest-earnings-report-2021-05-06,,,"Investors weren't thrilled with the latest earnings update from eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY). Sure, the online marketplace is benefiting from soaring e-commerce demand for everything ranging from collectible sneakers to automobiles. But its growth comparisons only get more difficult from here as it passes a full year since pandemic-related volume spikes started.
With that bigger picture in mind, let's look at some takeaways from this past week's first-quarter 2021 earnings report, and what they could mean for shareholders of this highly profitable business.
1. A widening portfolio
There was plenty for investors to celebrate in eBay's growth performance. Sales volumes jumped 24% year over year after accounting for exchange rate swings, marking an acceleration over the previous quarter's 18% increase.
Image source: Getty Images.
eBay's pool of active buyers continued to grow at a near-record pace, up 7% in each of the past two quarters compared to a roughly 2% uptick before the pandemic struck. Management said market share expanded in several major niches, including collectible sneakers, luxury watches, and trading cards, which just became an over $1 billion quarterly business. ""We delivered another strong quarter,"" CEO Jamie Iannone said in a press release, ""and an excellent start to the year for our buyers and sellers.""
2. Rising margins
Profitability is expanding thanks to the combination of robust sales growth, rising prices, and restrained expenses. eBay's transaction fee, which it charges buyers for the use of its platform, rose to 10% compared to 9.8% last quarter and 8.9% a year ago. The company's efficient operating model got even more powerful thanks to reduced marketing and selling expenses, too.
Overall, non-GAAP earnings shot higher by 45% to easily outpace the 42% boost in net sales. Cash flow was similarly strong, with a full 28% of sales converted into free cash this quarter. ""We generated tremendous volume and earnings,"" Iannone noted.
3. About that outlook
Despite all that good news, Wall Street pros focused on eBay's outlook as a reason to send the stock price lower immediately following the report. The company is predicting that volume gains will slow to between 8% and 10% in Q2, or roughly half this past quarter's pace.
That deceleration should be a big surprise, especially considering that volume jumped 29% in Q2 a year ago as pandemic lockdowns spurred a record demand spike for online retailing. It's great news for the business that eBay is targeting almost double-digit percentage gains compared to that epic surge.
Meanwhile, investor returns should be amplified by the company's gushing cash flow and expanding profitability. eBay sent over $400 million to shareholders in Q1, mainly through stock buybacks.
The next quarter should bring a temporary earnings dip as eBay laps the biggest volume spike from the pandemic while keeping up investments in growth initiatives like its advertising and payments processing projects.
But investors have every reason to expect bigger profits from eBay in 2021 and beyond. The platform is gaining market share in attractive niches, improving the transaction experience for buyers and sellers, and finding ways to charge more for added value. Those factors should support a rising stock price over time, despite Wall Street's knee-jerk reaction to this quarterly report.

2021-05-04 00:00:00+00:00,Should Investors Ignore Shopify's High Valuation?,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/should-investors-ignore-shopifys-high-valuation-2021-05-04,,,"Shopify (NYSE: SHOP) recently posted first-quarter numbers that easily beat Wall Street's expectations. The e-commerce platform's revenue rose 110% year over year to $988.6 million, accelerating from its 94% growth in the fourth quarter and beating estimates by $130 million.
Its merchant solutions revenue grew 137% to $668.0 million, and its subscriptions solutions revenue increased 71% to $320.7 million. Its GMV (gross merchandise volume), or the value of all goods sold on its platform, skyrocketed 114% to $37.3 billion.

Adjusted net income jumped from $22.3 million year over year to $254.1 million, or $2.01 per share. On a GAAP basis, which includes a $1.25 billion unrealized gain from the Affirm IPO in January, it posted a net profit of $1.26 billion -- compared to a loss of $31.4 million a year ago.
Shopify didn't provide exact guidance for the full year, but it doesn't expect to top its pandemic-driven growth in 2020. However, analysts still believe revenue and adjusted earnings can rise 51% and 7% this year, respectively.
These numbers all suggest Shopify is still a great growth stock, but it already trades at nearly 250 times forward earnings and over 30 times sales. The bulls will claim the company's strengths support that premium, but the bears will argue its valuation is unsustainable. Let's see who's right.
The bullish take on Shopify's valuation
The bulls will claim disruptive companies like Shopify deserve higher valuations.
The company's decentralized approach to e-commerce, which empowers small businesses to open their own online stores instead of relying on big online marketplaces like Amazon, is certainly powerful. Its tools make it easy for merchants to set up their e-commerce websites, process payments, fulfill orders, and manage their own marketing campaigns.
The bulls will also point out that while Shopify's price-to-sales ratio is historically high, it has risen at a much slower rate than its stock price.
Data by YCharts.
In other words, investors who wrung their hands over Shopify's high valuation missed out on its massive gains since its IPO in 2015. Profits are also climbing, which indicates its frothy P/E ratio could cool off in the same way Amazon's P/E ratio has contracted even as its stock price has risen over the past five years.
Data by YCharts.
The bearish take on Shopify's valuation
On the other hand, the bears will point out Shopify is far from the only contender in e-commerce services. Adobe's Magento, BigCommerce, WooCommerce, and Square all provide similar offerings for businesses to set up online stores, process payments, and fulfill orders.
Shopify is one of the market leaders, but it doesn't comfortably dominate the entire e-commerce services sector yet. Therefore, tougher competition could throttle Shopify's ability to raise prices and cross-sell new services to stabilize its bottom-line growth.
The critics also claim Shopify ignores problems with merchants that sell fake products and defraud consumers. Last December, FakeSpot -- which designs a browser extension that helps shield shoppers from fraudulent sellers -- raised red flags on 21% of its analyzed Shopify sites.
Rivals likely face similar challenges, but bad PR of this nature can tarnish Shopify's brand and erode its competitive defenses. Moreover, Shopify's share count has consistently risen over the past five years as it raised cash through new share offerings and subsidized its employees' salaries with big stock bonuses.
Data by YCharts.
That ongoing dilution makes it even tougher for Shopify's valuation to cool off. And in the near term, investors could keep selling out of frothy growth stocks as rising bond yields spark a rotation into value.
Just ignore it?
Shopify stock is expensive, but it's arguably wiser to focus on its long-term growth potential than its current multiples.
The company can keep growing as more merchants avoid crowded third-party marketplaces like Amazon and eBay. Meanwhile, its subscription-based services will likely lock in more merchants and widen its competitive moat.
It will inevitably suffer growing pains along the way, but investors who overanalyze price-to-earnings and price-to-sales metrics have already missed out on the company's multibagger gains, not to mention the upward trajectory that could very much continue long term. If all goes well, buying Shopify today might not be all that different from buying Amazon about five years ago.

2021-05-04 00:00:00+00:00,Top Consumer Stocks To Buy In May 2021? 4 For Your Watchlist,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/top-consumer-stocks-to-buy-in-may-2021-4-for-your-watchlist-2021-05-04,,,"4 Consumer Stocks To Consider Buying As Summer Nears
Consumer stocks have been a mixed bag for investors in the stock market. Of course, the coronavirus pandemic has wreaked havoc on many businesses. As bad as these impacts could be, there are always a few that would outperform its industry peers. That means there are still opportunities in the consumer sector. Sometimes, they are just harder to find. Admittedly, the coronavirus pandemic has had a devastating effect on the economy over the past year as many lost their jobs, and there was a growing list of retail bankruptcies.
Fortunately, we saw the ramp-up of vaccination efforts and a string of stimulus aids by the government. Many analysts are far more optimistic about our current state of the economy than just a few months ago. Judging from the current first-quarter earnings, there were some consumer stocks that topped Wall Street’s estimates. For instance, apparel brand Under Armour, Inc. (NYSE: UA) today announced that its first-quarter revenue was up 35% to $1.3 billion. Besides, it raised full-year revenue guidance, expecting a high-teen percentage revenue growth compared to a high-single-digit percentage previously.
Investors have many reasons to follow some of the top consumer stocks in the stock market today. It is not just companies that focus on consumer staples that are attracting attention. Companies focusing on consumer discretionary products are also seeing a recovery in their businesses. If anything, this is suggesting that the economic recovery is here and could continue to do so in the near term. With all that in mind, let’s take a look at some of the top consumer stocks to watch.
Top Consumer Stocks To Watch In May 2021
Crocs Inc. (NASDAQ: CROX)
Boston Beer Company (NYSE: SAM)
Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE: CL)
eBay Inc. (NASDAQ: EBAY)
Crocs
First up the list, Crocs stocks have been on a tear during the pandemic. It might come as a surprise to some, especially since the company has been on the market for more than a decade now. So, what changed? The foamy clogs exploded in popularity when people set aside fashion for comfort during the pandemic. If you have been going out to the beach, chances are that you have seen quite a number of people wearing the foam clogs shoes. Recently, CROX stock received another shot in the arm after the shoemaker increased its revenue outlook for the full year and reported record first-quarter sales.
Source: TD Ameritrade TOS
From its first-quarter report, revenue came in 64% higher to $460.1 million from $281.2 million a year earlier. That’s the best growth rate Crocs has reported in years. What’s impressive is that this came amid an economy that is struggling to recover smoothly. As for the second quarter, Crocs is now calling for sales to grow by 60% to 70% year over year.
Some speculate that there is a shift in consumer preference towards comfort rather than just appearance. If you believe that more people wearing Crocs is a trend that’s going to last, Crocs could stand to benefit further. With that in mind, would you bet on CROX stock today?

Boston Beer Company
Next up, Boston Beer’s stock has been on a tear since the start of the pandemic. While sales plunged when the stay-at-home measures were imposed, the company continued to defy gravity. That is partly thanks to rising demand from retailers for products like Truly hard seltzer and Twisted Tea. 
Source: TD Ameritrade TOS
No doubt, it’s already been a great year for SAM stock, but things are getting even better after the company reported its first quarter earnings. The company’s growth came in 48% higher year-over-year. More impressively, the company raised its aggressive outlook for fiscal 2021 thanks to its strong demand from its Truly hard seltzer. While competition has been heating up for seltzer products, Truly is having no problem continuing to win a growing share of the booming hard seltzer market.
The founder and chairman Jim Koch is also confident in their ability to innovate and build strong brands that complement its current portfolio and help support its mission of long-term profitable growth. Furthermore, let’s not forget Boston Beer’s track record of innovation and consistent profitability in recent years. Thus, would you say that the recent dip in SAM stock provides a good opportunity for investors to buy in?

Colgate-Palmolive Company
Colgate-Palmolive is possibly one of the best consumer stocks in the market. Chances are, you most probably have used this brand for at least some time in your life. Investors love CL stock because it has good regional diversification. Its key business segments include home care, personal care, oral care and pet nutrition. Consumers globally use its products daily, including its famous toothpaste. These are essential products people naturally use in good times and bad.
Source: TD Ameritrade TOS
On April 30, the company reported first-quarter revenue and profit that topped expectations. Sales rose 6.0% to $4.34 billion, exceeding analysts’ consensus of $4.27 billion. Besides, its earnings per share of $0.80 narrowly beat consensus of $0.79. CEO Noel Wallace believes the strong results reflect the impact of the company’s premium innovation, digital transformation and advertising. He also stated that the company has an exciting pipeline of innovation for the rest of the year across its product categories.
But the real reason why some investors are turning to CL stock is because of its enviable record in paying a dividend. If you’re an income investor, CL stock would stand out as one of the best dividend stocks to buy. The company made its first payout in 1895, and has begun increasing the dividend yield every year since 1963. Considering all these, does CL stock have a place in your portfolio?

eBay Inc.
Last on the list, eBay is a global e-commerce leader that connects millions of buyers and sellers around the world. The company recently topped Wall Street expectations as its quarterly revenue came in 42% higher to $3 billion. Besides, quarterly net income rose 45% to $758 million. Despite beating analysts’ estimates, investors don’t seem to be impressed with the company’s forward guidance. 
Source: TD Ameritrade TOS
There’s no question that the pandemic acts as a catalyst to online retailing, and that has continued to benefit eBay. According to the company annual active buyers grew by 7% to reach 187 million. On the other hand, annual active sellers rose by 8% to 20 million. These suggest that users have been more active on the platform during the pandemic. Nevertheless, the second-quarter outlook of an 8-10% revenue growth year-over-year might have disappointed some investors. 
Now, eBay is open to the possibility of accepting cryptocurrency as a form of payment, putting EBAY stock in the limelight. The company is also looking at ways to get non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on its platform. With the rise in NFTs, could eBay be looking at an alternative revenue growth driver in the near future? If so, would it be a good time to add EBAY stock to your portfolio?

2021-05-03 00:00:00+00:00,3 Beaten-Down Stocks to Buy Following Disappointing Q2 Sales Guidance,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-beaten-down-stocks-to-buy-following-disappointing-q2-sales-guidance-2021-05-03,,,"Based on reports released so far, this quarter's earnings season thus far has been a winner. With about a fourth of companies already reporting, the S&P 500's first-quarter bottom line is on pace to come in at $42.28 per share, more than doubling last year's COVID-crimped first-quarter profits. That result is also a bit better than expected. The broad market has also been buoyed by the combination of last quarter's results and earnings expectation going forward.
But not every company's stock price is up in response to last quarter's reports. A handful of stocks have been upended by a response to lackluster outlooks for the quarter currently underway. Given the bigger trends in play, though, these companies may merely be underpromising now in a way that positions them to overdeliver three months from now. That suggests these sell-offs might be prospective entry points.
Let's take a closer look at three companies whose earnings guidance may be underplaying their true growth potential.
Image source: Getty Images.
1. F5 Networks
F5 Networks (NASDAQ: FFIV) isn't a household name. That's because its target market is enterprises. The company offers several software suites that help companies manage their networks, apps, and websites. It's marketable stuff, even if it's of no interest to individual consumers for at-home use.
The proof of that lies in last quarter's numbers. Sales grew 19% year over year for the period ending in March, and though that didn't produce comparable profit growth, it was the second consecutive quarter of double-digit top-line improvement.
Investors aren't impressed. Share prices tumbled 9% last week following disappointing earnings guidance for the quarter ending in June. F5 is modeling per-share profits somewhere between $2.36 and $2.54, which leaves it room to fall short of the $2.50 per share analysts are collectively forecasting. That so-so guidance only underscores the fact that the company didn't grow its earnings last quarter. The revenue outlook isn't exactly thrilling either.
Investors may not want to buy into F5 Networks' relative pessimism.
While the lack of profit growth is a legitimate concern, there's no denying companies need what F5 is selling. The need for upgrades of digital connectivity technologies remains brisk despite the wave of demand prompted early last year when the pandemic suddenly forced tens of millions of people to start working from home. Tech market research outfit Gartner estimates spending on information technology will grow 8.4% this year following last year's lull, led by spending on devices, IT services, and software.
You should also know that F5 hasn't failed to top its earnings estimates in any quarter since the third quarter of 2019, and that's been the only quarterly earnings miss since at least 2018.
2. eBay
eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY) isn't a name that needs an introduction. Although it was eventually lapped by Amazon as the ruler of e-commerce, eBay was the first name to become a major in the business. It's also been a nice addendum to Amazon's reach, which has been tested by the surge in online shopping while the coronavirus has kept consumers at home. To this end, the online auction platform's first-quarter revenue was up a currency-adjusted 38% year over year, driving similar earnings growth.
As they say, though, the party's over -- at least according to eBay. The company's management is only expecting sales growth of between $2.98 billion and $3.03 billion for the second quarter, which should lead to operating profits of somewhere between $0.91 and $0.96 per share. That bottom-line outlook is lower than the year-ago figure of $1.02 per share, and only up a modest 5% from the year-earlier top line. Analysts are collectively modeling income of $0.95 per share on sales of $3.0 billion, giving the company a small chance to beat estimates yet still not produce meaningful growth.
Investors aren't sticking around to see how it shakes out. Share prices are down more than 10% since eBay dished out that guidance.
The concern is understandable. But eBay just might be underplaying its second-quarter outlook. Although the end of the pandemic is in sight, many newly developed shopping habits are sticking around. The National Retail Federation expects online sales growth of between 18% and 23% this year, and while eBay may not be able to plug into all of that growth, even capturing some of it would lead to results above and beyond current projections.
3. Ford
Finally, add Ford Motor (NYSE: F) to your list of stocks beaten down by Q2 guidance that's worse than it needs to be.
Anyone who's kept close tabs on the market's more nuanced stories likely knows the world is facing a semiconductor chip shortage right now. It's not just affecting the tech sector, either. Automobile makers are hampered by skimpy supplies as well. Along with its first-quarter numbers released on Thursday, Ford cautioned shareholders that production of cars could be stymied through 2022 until the chip shortage abates.
More immediately, the company reports second-quarter production could be as little as half of its original plan after missing Q1's initially projected output estimate by 17%. Despite the healthy sales growth, swing back to profitability, and topping last quarter's revenue and income estimates, the production news sent the stock price careening to the tune of more than 9%.
Investors may be reading more into Thursday's disappointing output guidance than is necessary, however. The company's been warning the market about the chip shortage for weeks now, with share prices falling a total of 12% from their mid-March high of $13.62. Wednesday's post-close guidance only reiterated what we already knew. The market priced it in twice, perhaps shocked by the sheer scope of the current quarter's contracted outlook.
The thing is, although it's a long-term concern, the company's top brass suspects the current quarter will be the worst in terms of technological component supply constraints, with things only easing from Q3 on. That -- paired with expected double-digit percentage sales and earnings growth this year and next despite the chip shortage -- turns the recent selling into a prime entry opportunity.

May 3 (Reuters) - EBay Inc EBAY.O is open to the possibility of accepting crytpocurrency as a form of payment in the future and is looking at ways to get non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on its platform, the company said on Monday.
A growing number of companies have begun to accept virtual currencies as a form of payment, taking an asset class that had been shunned by major financial institutions a few years ago, a step closer to becoming mainstream.
Tesla Inc TSLA.O is already accepting bitcoin BTC=BTSP as payment for its electric cars, while payments giant PayPal PYPL.O last year started allowing customers to buy, sell and hold cyrptocurrencies using its online wallets.
""We are always looking at the most relevant forms of payment and will continue to assess that going forward. We have no immediate plans, but it (cryotocurrency) is something we are keeping an eye on,"" eBay said in a statement to Reuters.
In an interview with CNBC, Chief Executive Officer Jamie Lannone said that accepting virtual currency was an option the company was looking at.
EBay, which disappointed investors with a weak second-quarter profit forecast last week, said it was looking at a ""number of ways"" to get into the NFT space.
NFTs, a type of digital asset that exists on a blockchain, have exploded in popularity this year, with NFT artworks selling for millions of dollars and musicians such as the Kings of Leon rock group embracing them for their latest album.
""We're exploring opportunities on how we can enable it (NFTs) on eBay in an easy way,"" Lannone said on CNBC.
""Everything that's collectible has been on eBay for decades and will continue to be for the next few decades.""

2021-05-03 00:00:00+00:00,Analysts Forecast 11% Gains Ahead For IWY,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/analysts-forecast-11-gains-ahead-for-iwy-2021-05-03,,,"Looking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at ETF Channel, we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. For the iShares Russell Top 200 Growth ETF (Symbol: IWY), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $159.22 per unit.
With IWY trading at a recent price near $144.06 per unit, that means that analysts see 10.52% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of IWY's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are Centene Corp (Symbol: CNC), eBay Inc. (Symbol: EBAY), and DexCom Inc (Symbol: DXCM). Although CNC has traded at a recent price of $61.74/share, the average analyst target is 26.50% higher at $78.10/share. Similarly, EBAY has 20.17% upside from the recent share price of $55.79 if the average analyst target price of $67.05/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting DXCM to reach a target price of $462.76/share, which is 19.86% above the recent price of $386.10. Below is a twelve month price history chart comparing the stock performance of CNC, EBAY, and DXCM:
Below is a summary table of the current analyst target prices discussed above:
NAME SYMBOL RECENT PRICE AVG. ANALYST 12-MO. TARGET % UPSIDE TO TARGET
iShares Russell Top 200 Growth ETF IWY $144.06 $159.22 10.52%
Centene Corp CNC $61.74 $78.10 26.50%
eBay Inc. EBAY $55.79 $67.05 20.17%
DexCom Inc DXCM $386.10 $462.76 19.86%
Are analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past. These are questions that require further investor research.

May 3 (Reuters) - The S&P 500 and the Dow indexes ended higher on Monday amid a largely upbeat earnings season, while the Nasdaq came under pressure from declines in some high-flying growth stocks, as the rotation into cyclical and ""economy reopening"" stocks continued.
Economy-sensitive cyclical S&P 500 sectors such as consumer staples .SPLRSC, energy .SPNY, and materials .SPLRCM outperformed sectors housing growth stocks, including technology .SPLRCM and communication services, .SPLRCL.
The largest percentage gainer on the S&P 500 was oil field services firm Baker Hughes BKR.N, which rose 8%. Apparel retailers also finished strong, with Gap Inc GPS.N shares jumping 7.1% and Foot Locker Inc FL.N up 4.1%.
""All of those names that are having outsized gain today are as a result of economic reopening optimism, and people getting out of the house spending money on things,"" said Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 0.7% to close at 34,113.23 points, while the S&P 500 .SPX gained 0.27% to 4,192.66. The Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 0.48%, to 13,895.12.
Volume on U.S. exchanges was 10.29 billion shares, compared with the 9.86 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.
""We've seen a slight change in the pace of value stocks outperforming growth stocks year-to-date,"" said Rod von Lipsey, managing director at UBS Private Wealth Management.
The Nasdaq index fell as megacap technology stocks, including Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O, Alphabet Inc GOOGL.O, Facebook Inc FB.O and Microsoft Corp MSFT.O, traded lower despite largely upbeat results.
The stocks have struggled to maintain the upward trajectory coming into reporting season. Chipmakers also fell, with the Philadelphia SE Semiconductor index .SOXdown by 1.2%.
With more than half of S&P 500 companies having reported so far, profits are now seen rising 46% in the first quarter, compared with forecasts of 24% growth at the start of April, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. About 87% of the companies have come also reported earnings per share ahead of analysts' estimates.
""This is now the fourth straight quarter of earnings just absolutely crushing estimates,"" said Ross Mayfield, investment strategy analyst at Baird. ""I think there just continues to be an underestimation of how strong this rally and how strong the economy is rebounding.""
Strong earnings, improving economic data, fiscal stimulus and the Federal Reserve's ultra accommodative stance have supported markets, pushing the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq indexes to record levels last week.
U.S. manufacturing activity grew at a slower pace in April, likely constrained by shortages of inputs amid pent-up demand due to rising vaccinations and massive fiscal stimulus.
The Labor Department's non-farm payrolls data, slated to be released on Friday, is expected to show a rise in job additions in April.
The largest decliner was Estee Lauder EL.N, which dropped 7.9% after the cosmetics maker missed analysts' estimates for third-quarter sales.
The largest gainer on the Nasdaq 100 was Ebay Inc EBAY.OQ, which rose 4.2% after the e-commerce firm says it is open to accepting to cryptocurrencies in future.
T-Mobile TMUS.O, Uber UBER.K, Lyft LYFT.O, Square SQ.N, Peloton PTON.O and Pfizer PFE.N are poised to report results later this week.
