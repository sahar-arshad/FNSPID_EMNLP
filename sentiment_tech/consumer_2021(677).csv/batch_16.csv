2021-08-31 00:00:00+00:00,3 Reasons to Consider eBay Stock Right Now,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-reasons-to-consider-ebay-stock-right-now-2021-08-31,,,"eBay's (NASDAQ: EBAY) business is thriving during the pandemic. Millions of folks look to the e-commerce auction and shopping site for a wide assortment of goods that includes everything from diapers to trading cards. And over the past 18 months or so, because it operates exclusively online, some of its customers have greatly appreciated that they can shop at eBay in a way that helps them avoid exposure to COVID-19.
Investors have noticed eBay's performance of late and the stock price is up over 53% year to date. Still, it's not too late for investors considering this stock.
What follows are three reasons to consider buying eBay stock right now.
Image source: Getty Images.
1. eBay has an asset-lite business model that scales efficiently
In contrast to Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), eBay does not operate fulfillment centers. It also leaves the responsibility for shipping and handling to the buyers and sellers to work out themselves. This business model essentially makes eBay a middleman, creating a marketplace that brings buyers and sellers together to transact. For its services, eBay collects a small commission on each transaction.
The business model is proving to be lucrative, with operating profit margins holding above 20% every year for the previous decade. That's also in contrast to Amazon, which has not managed to produce a single year of operating profit margins above 10% over the last decade. Even during the pandemic boom, Amazon's operating profit margin only hit 5.9%.
The caveat here is that Amazon earned that margin on nearly $400 billion in annual sales, whereas eBay's annual revenue was slightly over $10 billion. Still, it highlights that eBay is more nimble and efficient in its business and is earning a higher profit margin.
2. eBay is increasing the take rate on transactions
The fee (take rate) eBay earns for bringing buyers and sellers together has been increasing. From Q2 2020 to Q2 2021, eBay raised what it collects from transactions by over 200 basis points, from 9.2% to 11.3%. This is a result of migrating sellers to internal payment systems and nudging sellers to promote their listings (which eBay also facilitates for a fee).
The migration to the new fee model is four-fifths of the way completed, so there is a little more room for the shift to boost the take rate. And once shifted over, buyers and sellers are likely to use these payment methods longer-term. In other words, this is not some short-term boost that could later reverse.
3. eBay's stock price is reasonable right now
Even though eBay stock price is up 50% this year, the forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio on the stock is still reasonable. Trading at a forward P/E of 20, the stock is not expensive, considering that the company is such an excellent performer in terms of operating profits.
The stock will be further supported in the near term with the company's heavy stock buyback program. Overall, eBay management has over $7 billion in authorization for buybacks from the board of directors.
Importantly, when a company is buying back its own stock, it reduces the supply in the market, which can help lift prices higher. Furthermore, reducing the number of shares outstanding means that profits are split among fewer shares, which increases earnings per share (if all else is held constant).
Buying eBay stock is not going to make you a millionaire overnight. Still, the asset-lite business model, the high profit margins, and the favorable valuation will likely work together to increase your portfolio's wealth over the long term.

Brian Withers: I'm going to take Prakash's question first, I would like to put 25% of my portfolio in Square and hold it for five years. Do you think this is a risky allocation?"" That depends, and we can't give personal advice. But let me talk a little bit about how I think of investing in a company. If right now, if 25% of your portfolio and you only have five to 10 stocks, that might not be a big piece. If you're continuing to work and continuing to put money into the market every month, that 25% is going to get diluted over time. I absolutely love your hold-for-five-years perspective and I think Square is going to do well over the next five years. Just really think about your allocation and in what you want to do there and make sure you're diversified.
Matt Frankel: We have time for one more?
Withers: Yeah.
Frankel: OK. I will answer the one from Brand New Fool that says how does Adyen compare to Square and Afterpay. Adyen is based in the Netherlands. They are really a truly omnichannel player. When I think PayPal, I think mostly online. I mentioned I bet they have a 95% card-not-present rate. When I think of Square, I think mostly in-person. Adyen does both. They have been very successful more so than Square and PayPal at larger merchants. I believe Uber is an Adyen client. Microsoft uses Adyen for payment processing. A lot of the big, big companies in the world do. They were the ones who replaced PayPal at eBay, if you remember the big news story a year ago where PayPal dropped eBay as their preferred payment processor. Adyen specializes in big merchants. They are a truly international company. They operate throughout most of the world. North America is I think a quarter or their revenue, which is a big, big thing. It's an interesting market. It's a different kind of focus. It's omnichannel, large merchants, whereas PayPal and Square are both more specialized, I would say.

Additionally, companies that pay dividends tend to be more mature, offering stable earnings and cash flows -- features that can make an investment less risky.
Target (NYSE: TGT) and eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY) could be good candidates if you're looking for dividend stocks to add to your portfolio. Both have thrived during the pandemic and are likely to hold their own during economic reopenings as well.

Target
Ranked the seventh-largest retailer in the U.S., Target has a record of increasing its dividend every year dating back to 1971. Such a long history of delivering growing dividends can make an investor more secure in a company's stability. Recently, Target announced a 32% increase in its quarterly dividend to $0.90 per share. That amounts to $3.60 per share annually if it continues at that rate, up from the $2.68 it paid in fiscal 2020. The dividend yield is 1.45%, higher than the 1.29% on the S&P 500.
The company thrived in fiscal 2020, growing sales by 19.8%. The momentum is flowing into 2021 as Target continues to optimize the business. The rollout of same-day fulfillment services for orders that start online -- and then are picked up in person or delivered for a fee in hours -- has been popular with consumers and is accounting for a rapidly increasing part of sales. Importantly, when a customer chooses one of these options, it costs Target far less than shipping the item to the customer's home.
The trend is showing up in results. Management estimates Target will report an operating profit margin north of 8% for fiscal 2021. That would be the highest for the company dating back at least 10 years.
The market has noticed, and the stock is up 40% in 2021. Still, shares of Target are not expensive. Trading at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 19, its stock is relatively fairly valued.
eBay
While eBay does not have as long a history of paying a dividend as Target, it can still be a good stock to consider. Like Target, the company has done well during the pandemic but for different reasons. People looking to avoid making trips to physical stores went to the company's website for some of their shopping needs.
eBay's business model brings buyers and sellers of items together in its online marketplace. The company takes a commission from each transaction. It does not operate fulfillment facilities or carry inventory. This policy allows eBay to generate a high profit margin. Indeed, over the past decade, eBay averaged an operating profit margin of 23.9%. Businesses that are asset-light, like eBay is, and generate a high profit margin, as eBay does, make for excellent dividend stocks.
For the three months ended June 30, eBay paid investors dividends of $0.18 per share, up from $0.16 a year earlier. Annualized, eBay's dividend will come to $0.72, giving it a 0.95% dividend yield -- and the company's excellent profit margin could allow it to increase those dividend payments over the long run.
Fortunately for investors, the stock is not expensive. It's trading at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 19.6. In fact, both Target and eBay are good values for dividend investors at current prices.

2021-08-28 00:00:00+00:00,3 Top Stocks That Just Blew Away Wall Street Expectations,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-top-stocks-that-just-blew-away-wall-street-expectations-2021-08-28,,,"The second-quarter earnings season was packed with mostly good news for investors. Many of the market's biggest companies, from retailers to tech giants, raised their 2021 outlooks following a surprisingly strong first half of the year.
But there were some notable standouts even among the list of expectation-beating companies in the past few weeks. Let's look at why eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY), Garmin (NASDAQ: GRMN), and Target (NYSE: TGT) thrilled Wall Street with their latest operating updates.
Image source: Getty Images.
eBay has the cash
eBay's growth in Q2 didn't shock investors, although the marketplace enjoyed double-digit sales gains even as volumes turned negative compared to a year ago. Yet the e-commerce specialist had even better news to report about its earnings potential.
eBay's seller fees jumped to 11.3% compared to 9.7% a year ago and 10.5% in the previous quarter. That surge is important because those charges filter almost directly into earnings. Higher fees also reflect the extra value eBay is packing into its marketplace through recent additions like promoted listings, payments processing, and a revamped shopping experience.
Continued progress here means investors might see even more growth in the fee rate, which will support higher cash returns. That's already happening today, with free cash flow hitting a whopping 34% of sales in Q2.
Target hits its goal
Expectations could hardly have been higher for Target's mid-August earnings report. But the retailer trounced them anyway. Sales jumped 9% in Q2 -- and that was on top of the 24% spike it posted a year earlier. Target's impressive track record of winning market share in niches like consumer tech, apparel, and home furnishings continued.
TGT Operating Margin (TTM) data by YCharts.
Wall Street loves that these merchandising categories mostly raise Target's overall profit margin. That boost is being further supported by a shift toward premium products and premium fulfillment options like same-day delivery. But Target's business isn't set up simply to profit during economic expansions like the one we're going through right now. Its nearly 50-year streak of consecutive annual dividend raises means shareholders can rest easy about the next industry downturn, whether it hits this year or in several years.
Garmin navigates home
Consumer tech can be a brutal competitive space, but Garmin appears to have it figured out. The GPS navigation device giant has been growing sales and core profitability for roughly six years despite weaknesses in some parts of its portfolio from time to time.
That success is partly due to a widening collection of niches that it caters to, including smartwatches, fitness trackers, and aviation and boating navigation. You can see evidence of Garmin's innovation prowess in its recent 53% sales spike.
CEO Cliff Pemble and his team just secured a fourth massive manufacturing factory, which should help it double its capacity in the coming quarters. That's good news because soaring demand across its portfolio has Garmin operating near its limits today.
That outsize level of growth isn't necessary for investors to enjoy strong returns by holding the stock, but it will support long-term returns by driving costs down and increasing Garmin's installed base of devices over the next few years.

Therefore, a good first due diligence step in forming an expectation of annual yield going forward, is looking at the history above, for a sense of stability over time. This can help in judging whether the most recent dividends from these companies are likely to continue. If they do continue, the current estimated yields on annualized basis would be 0.95% for eBay Inc., 1.51% for Progress Software Corp, and 0.48% for Electronic Arts, Inc..
In Friday trading, eBay Inc. shares are currently down about 0.1%, Progress Software Corp shares are up about 0.8%, and Electronic Arts, Inc. shares are up about 0.2% on the day.

Poshmark (NASDAQ:POSH), the new and second-hand clothing online store, produced excellent earnings for its second quarter ending June 30 on Aug. 10. With that in mind, here is the bottom line: POSH stock is worth at least 55% more at $41.20, compared to its price as of Aug. 21 of $26.53.

You wouldn’t know this from the way the stock has performed lately. Short sellers have been attacking it, and now hold a 21.6% stake in its float, according to Yahoo! Finance. 
The stock has dropped from its high of $104.98 shortly after it went public on Jan. 14 and recently hit a low of $25.62. As of Aug. 20, POSH stock was at $26.53. So is the stock is at a trough? I think so since my target price is $41.20.
What Poshmark Is Worth
Overall, the reason I believe this is because the company is now clearly producing large amounts of free cash flow (FCF). In Q2, its sales were up 22% year-over-year (YoY) to $81.8 million. The company’s “take rate” was high at 18.2% since its Gross Merchandise Value (GMV), the total of all transactions, was $449.6 million.
This take rate was even higher than the take rate at Etsy (NASDAQ:ETSY), which I recently wrote about. Their take rate is lower at 17.4% and their price-sales (P/S) multiple for 2022 is 9.28 times vs. 5.10 times for Poshmark. So clearly, POSH stock is worth more than its present price. But how much more?

8 Great Low-Priced Stocks to Buy Under $10
One way to do this is to estimate its FCF going forward and then set a value on that. For example, for the six months ending June 30, Poshmark reported that its operating cash flow was $25.14 million. After deducting $849K in capex spending, the FCF for the six months was $24.291 million. Since Poshmark’s six months’ sales were $162.713 million, its FCF margin was 14.93%. Let’s call it 15% for forecasting purposes.
Next, if we apply the 15% FCF margin to the company’s 2022 forecast sales of $418.9 million, we can predict that FCF will hit $62.84 million in 2022. We can use this to value POSH stock.
For example, if the market gives it a 2% FCF yield, the market value would be $3.141 billion (i.e., $62.84 million/0.02=$3.14 billion). This is 53.4% higher than its $2.047 billion market value right now, as measured by Yahoo! Finance.
In other words, expect POSH stock to rise to $41.20 once the market values its FCF properly at a 2% yield. That is the same as valuing FCF at a market value of 50 times. (i.e., 1/0.02 = 50).
Where This Leaves Poshmark
Moreover, Poshmark’s growth and its take rate are very impressive. That is why I think its underlying inherent value is at least 55% higher, as shown in my analysis above. But the truth is that the stock is also weighted down by comparison with Ebay (NASDAQ:EBAY).
For example, eBay has a market value of $47.35 billion, but its 2022 forecast sales are $11 billion. That means that its P/S metric is just 4.3 times. This is slightly lower than Poshmark’s 5.1 ratio, even though I argued that POSH stock deserves to have a higher P/S value.
But let’s look closer. eBay reported that its Q2 GMV was $22.1 billion, and it produced sales of $2.7 billion from that GMV. Therefore, its take rate was just 12.2%, vs. the much higher Poshmark take rate of 18.2% (see above). So clearly, Poshmark has a much more profitable (about 50% more) business model — as long as it can produce free cash flow margins that are high from this high take rate.
In turn, this is why I still think that POSH stock will eventually have a higher price than right now. The market will realize over time that its business model is more profitable in the long run than eBay’s.
What To Do With POSH Stock
Now that the stock is at a trough, it is probably a good time to begin averaging into it even if it keeps on falling. After all, the stock trades for just 5.1 times sales and has a very profitable FCF margin. Over time, the market will revalue it at least 55% to $41.20 per share.
It could take to the end of 2022 for this to happen (i.e., over 1.33 years from now). The average annual compounded return will be 39.1% per year on a compound average growth rate (CAGR) basis.

*Stock Advisor returns as of August 9, 2021
This video was recorded on August 13, 2021.
Chris Hill: We've got the latest headlines from Wall Street, we'll talk about the Investing Mindset with author Julia Galef, and as always, we've got a couple of stocks on our radar. We begin this week in the magic kingdom. Shares of Disney were up on Friday after a blowout third quarter report, profits were much higher than expected, and the Disney+ streaming service now has 116 million subscribers. I will point out, Ron, it was less than two years ago that they launched it and they're already at 116 million.
Ron Gross: Very, very impressive. They ended the quarter with a total of 174 million streaming subscribers overall, and that's just 35.5 million short of Netflix's subscriber base and Netflix has been at this game for quite some time. Really impressive. Overall, the quarter really beat expectations on the top and the bottom line. Overall revenue was up 45%, and as we noted, streaming is most of the story here, but the theme parks are back despite the rising Delta variant. As you said, Disney subscribers doubled to 116 million. ESPN subscribers increased 75%, Hulu subscribers up 21%. The whole overall direct-to-consumer division, which includes that streaming business, had a 57% increase in revenue. But it's important to note they did report a loss in that division of about $299 million because they invested in programming, which as we know from all the years of Netflix is expensive, so we have to keep an eye on that. Also very important to keep an eye on average monthly revenue per paid subscriber. For Disney+ that actually decreased to $416 million from $4.62 and that's due to a higher mix of Disney+ Hotstar, which is the subscription service in India. That metric is going to be really key to profitability for the streaming business and where the growth comes from, whether it's overseas or domestic, is going to be an important part of the story as well.
Theme Park revenue rose for the first time in five quarters. Great to see that back. Upcoming Theme Park reservations at the two U.S. parks remain strong even as the COVID Delta cases increased. We saw some weakness in their network business due to an increase in production and marketing costs. But overall, adjusted earnings per share for the quarter increased to $0.80 from just $0.08 in the prior year. Now the stock is not cheap, we've got Disney selling at 40 times earnings here. Disney is not the highest growth story in the world. The digital business is exciting. Let's keep an eye on the stock. As I said, not the cheapest it's ever been.
Hill: Although it's interesting when you mention the ESPN+ numbers, it's interesting to see that one of the benefits of the Disney+ streaming service is basically a catalyst to get people into ESPN+ and Hulu the way they bundle that service.
Gross: Absolutely. The fact that sports is back and sports gaming is back and excitement in general, we have the NFL heating up now. All important for ESPN, Hulu Live, a bit pricier than just the Hulu regular. Hulu is good for the average price point as well. Yes, that bundle is very important.
Hill: As good as Airbnb second quarter revenue was, the company said it expects third quarter revenue to be a record. That guidance also came with warnings about the Delta variant and that was enough to keep Airbnb stock flat this week, Jason.
Jason Moser: Yes. They did a good job walking the line here. Not being too optimistic but yet not being too pessimistic either. I think that it's clear that people are traveling again and Airbnb is proving to be a prime beneficiary there. It won't be a straight lineup, at least in the near term but we saw this with Disney's report, we saw this with Airbnb report, we are seeing signs of least that people are starting to accept and learn more how to live in a world where COVID exists ultimately. That's a good thing because it's going to be the case, I think for some time to come. But as far as the numbers are impressive, the revenue for the quarter of $1.3 billion, that was up 300% basically from a year ago, that's for obvious reasons. Let's take a look at 2019, shall we say, Chris? It's still up by 10% from 2019 so it's very respectable there. Adjusted EBITDA, $217 million, that was up substantially from a year ago and even from 2019, as the company works toward profitability. But the numbers are really impressive, 83.1 million nights and experiences booked that was basically flat with 2019, obviously up considerably from last year, $13.4 billion in gross booking value. That was up 37% from 2019 as demand continues to pick back up. Which is ultimately what leads them to their rosy predictions there for the third quarter, as you mentioned. The persistence of COVID and Delta remains, but they do expect quarter three revenue to be their strongest quarter ever.
As demand starts to pick back up, they are seeing guests from countries with higher vaccination rates, including the U.S. and parts of Europe that's really driving the travel recovery. They are introducing features to the platform like flexible dates, which is really proving to be quite popular in this environment. Interestingly, the trend of long-term stays. They highlighted this in the first quarter, with stays of 28 days or longer. That remains one of the largest and strongest growing parts of the business. It seems like they're benefiting from a number of different trends here given their brand awareness in the space, it feels like they're setting themselves up for a pretty good run here.
Hill: eBay's second quarter revenue was light, gross merchandise volume fell, and guidance for the third quarter was lower than expected. But despite all that, shares of eBay were up 10% this week. Ron, as a shareholder, I'm not complaining, I'm confused though.
Gross: The quarter was mixed and as you noted, revenue guidance was weak, revenue up 14%, but that GMV, that gross merchandise volume was down 7% as the company faced tough comps to last year's really strong growth. On the conference call, management noted that they're seeing positive GMV growth compared to pre-pandemic levels two years ago, which is always smart to compare it to pre-pandemic. The fact that they used the word positive and I didn't really get into some details to me, I'm thinking that means slightly positive, maybe not that exciting. They did in the quarter with 159 million active buyers, that's a decline of 2%. Flattish from a year earlier, they had weak operating margins, but they managed to report adjusted EPS, which was flat. eBay, they're looking to generate more revenue from the advertising in the payments business in order to offset that slowing growth from the online marketplace. During the quarter, they processed 71% of online platform buying through their own managed payments. That's an important part of their future. Under pressure from activist investors, they're selling off non-core businesses. I like that a lot. They completed the sale of their classified business for $13 billion, and announced an agreement to sell 80% of eBay Korea for about $3 billion. I like that as well. Now revenue guidance, as you mentioned, was weak as vaccinations continue to roll out as people return to pre-pandemic habits. That's just the nature of the game. But still understanding all that and looking back compared to two years, the quarter was relatively solid. The stock is not that expensive at 17 times, so there's room for buyers to come in and cause some strength to the stock.
Hill: Shares of Unity Software up nearly 20% this week, after a second quarter report was highlighted by strong revenue. Jason, there were concerns that Apple's new privacy changes were going to hurt Unity Software's advertising platform, looks like they're in pretty good shape.
Moser: Yeah. I think that's just a very near-term headwind that shouldn't really pose too much of an issue for Unity Software. Mainly that's if you are a believer that the MedVerse is inevitable, and Chris, I am. I think the MedVerse it's on the way. I don't know that I'm going to really participate all that much in it, Chris, but I think it's common. But do you think we're headed toward a world of 3D and interactive content more than the norm? It feels like Unity is really a company that you need to own and that really bares out the numbers they're presenting. Revenue for the quarter was up 48% from a year ago ahead of their guidance. That was the 11th consecutive quarter of 30% or greater revenue growth, which is really impressive, of course. The Create Solutions business, that's the smaller part of the business revenue growth of 31% there, that's one that's based on subscriptions and contracts. The Operate Solutions, that was up 63%. That's a revenue share and usage-based model, so clearly we're seeing engagement headed in the right direction. I think 888 customers each generated more than $100,000 of revenue for the company over the past year compared to 716 large customers from a year ago, and the dollar-based net expansion rate of 142% over the same from a year ago. Again, they continue to do very good things to bring people in and keep them there. Making an effort to consolidate the space a little bit there, bringing in some little bolt-on acquisitions as time goes on not only to build out their capability, but it also really helps keep that flow of talent steady, which is really important in this line of work. All things considered, a very strong quarter for the business, one that I own, I've recommended it and continue to remain very optimistic about it.
Hill: Just in time for the start of the school year, good second quarter results from Chegg. The online education company's profits and revenue came in higher than expected. Jason, Chegg also bumped up their full year guidance.
Moser: Really exciting to see the kids getting ready to go back to school. Hopefully this 2021-2022 year shakes out to be far better than the last one. In regards to Chegg though, this has been a fascinating business to follow. It's really evolved over time to not only remain relevant, but to become more relevant. It seems they went from just a stodgy textbook business, to e-textbooks to now services. It seems like it's proving itself to be an invaluable resource for educators and students alike. The numbers were very impressive. Net revenue grew 30% from a year ago and 38% growth in the Chegg Services side of the business. That was $174 million of their total, $198 million in revenue, and so 4.9 million Chegg Services subscribers now. That's up 31% from a year-ago. Both revenue and subscribers have more than doubled in the past two years for this business as they continue to invest in that network, and then all of the information that helps the aid that it provides for students.
The neat thing about this business, acquisition costs are so low because it's just the brand awareness and word of mouth alone. They just don't have to invest a lot in actually acquiring those customers, so this results in a modestly raising guidance. They are working on limiting account sharing. I know one of the criticisms there with Chegg is that it can promote perhaps less than ethical behavior for students. They are working on that day, they are investing in a feature of a product called Honors Shield. This is ultimately security to help prevent cheating and protect the integrity of the system. But listen, there is a reason the stock's up over 1,100% over the last five years. It still feels like it's got plenty of room to grow with around 20 million total college students in the U.S. today. I like what I'm seeing from Chegg.
Hill: DoorDash posted record revenue in the second quarter, but the actual loss for the quarter was bigger than expected. Ron, DoorDash was down after the bell on Thursday, but on Friday, shares recovered. I'm assuming their guidance for the full year probably helped.
Gross: Yeah, but it was also cautious. The quarter was very strong with sales up 83%, total orders up 69%. That's driven by increased order frequency as well as new customer growth. International orders grew substantially faster than domestic, but expenses more than doubled as the company increased investments to build out non-meal categories, a very important part of their growth strategy to expand internationally and to boost driver recruitment in a labor market that's very tight. Management said they intend to increase that level of investment in these categories in the second half of 2021. That speaks to your comment about guidance, which I think was somewhat cautious based on the increased costs that they're seeing. They've added over 5,000 new third-party convenience stores as part of their growth initiative, they launched Albertson in the grocery category, they added PetSmart, moving into many things other than just restaurants. They launched in Japan, that's their third international market behind Canada and Australia. But they did report a loss of $100 million versus a profit of $23 million during the pandemic when business was gangbusters. Guidance for Q3, again included a seasonal decline. That shouldn't be surprising to people. But it does also include increased levels of investments for those news categories and those international markets. They're spending money to grow, which is essential. But that probably will take out by profitability for a while.
Hill: Second quarter revenue for The Trade Desk was double what it was a year ago. Good guidance as well, but when you look at shares of The Trade Desk this week, Jason, it's almost like investors couldn't make up their mind. They were down after the report, then it recovered. It's basically flat for the week.
Moser: Yeah there was a state of upgrades the day after the release. I understand why. To me, this is one I remain a very happy owner of, because it just continues to be one of the most attractive ways to invest in the advertising opportunity. It really all comes down to the connected TV for The Trade Desk. To that point, management noted on the call that MoffettNathanson recently reported that the ad supported video on demand market will grow to $4.4 billion in 2022, around $18 billion as early as 2025. Clearly a lot of opportunity there. Particularly as you see, all of these ad supported platforms, Disney+, Hulu, Peacock, Discovery+. All of these different ads platforms contributed to Trade Desk's success. Revenue more than doubled from a year ago at over $280 million for the quarter. Non-GAAP earnings per share followed suit. Customer retention remains robust at over 95% during the quarter as it has remained for the last seven years. These guys are consistently doing something very well. They do see that advertising video on demand market that's going to outpace the growth of the subscription video on demand market over the coming years.
I think from a global perspective that's important to remember. That really is the nature, I think, of this advertising video on demand market. That's where the opportunity is. They're seeing plenty of big brand spending. They saw the number of brands spending more than $1 million in connected TVs on their platform. It's already more than doubled from a year ago. The number of advertisers spending over $100,000 has also doubled. They just continue to bring more customers in because they've got what they want and you like that market opportunity. I think The Trade Desk is a business you need to keep a close eye on.
Hill: Last month, shares of Boston Beer fell 25% after a disastrous second quarter earnings report. But fear not shareholders. Boston Beer is teaming up with Pepsi to create an alcoholic version of Mountain Dew. Boston Beer will make it, Pepsi will deliver and market the product. Ron. Hard Mountain Dew is expected to hit the shelves early next year. Are you interested?
Gross: The phrase flavored malt beverage makes me gag a little bit to be honest with you. But I've never been a big Mountain Dew fan in the first place. The flavor doesn't sit right with me. I feel this is more a novelty item and something that's going to storm the category and help Boston Beer's hard seltzer beverage business. But I could maybe just be a little cynical about this and maybe you guys have a different opinion, but I don't see this changing the direction of Boston Beer. I know Coke has their hard virgin of their topo Chico sparkling water, this is Pepsi's entry into the space. I'm not convinced.
Hill: I don't know, Jason, I get why both these companies are doing it. Particularly Boston Beer.
Moser: I'm with you, it feels like Boston Beer might need to change its name to Boston Beverage given that it is not so much a beer company anymore. I think novelty is probably the right word Ron. It feels to me like KFC Crocs or something. Is this really what the masses want? Probably not, certainly don't mind them giving it a shot, but I don't know that we'll be seeing them breaking these sales results out in any future quarters.
Gross: Do we want it to be green? Is that important to the novelty aspect of this?
Moser: This day and age, everybody is so focused on health and wellness. It takes those colors that make it clear. Maybe that's a selling point, if you keep it clear.
Hill: Having the right mindset is important for any investor. That's where our guest comes in. Julia Galef is co-founder of the Center for Applied Rationality and author of the book, The Scout Mindset: Why Some People See Things Clearly And Others Don't. Recently, my colleague Maria Gallagher talked with Julia about how investors can improve their thinking and the ways in which a scout mindset differs from a soldier mindset.
Julia Galef: These are my framing metaphors for the book. I will start with the soldier mindset. This is my term for the motivation to defend your pre-existing beliefs or to defend the things that you want to believe against any evidence that might threaten those beliefs. I'm sure everyone has encountered this before. I'm not the person to point it out. You might have heard of it under the name rationalizing or wishful thinking or denial. The term that Cognex scientists more often use is motivated reasoning or like full-term is directionally motivated reasoning, reasoning that's aimed at arriving at a sort of predetermined conclusion. My favorite concise definition of what that looks like comes from a psychologist named Tom Gilovich. He said that when you're engaged in motivated reasoning and you encounter something you want to believe, you evaluate it through the lens, can I believe this? Sort of looking for any excuse to accept it. Whereas, if you are evaluating something you don't want to believe, you instead look at it through the lens of, must I believe this, and look for any reason to reject it. So just kind of applying an asymmetric standard of evidence or criteria that you are using when you evaluate evidence. I call that soldier mindset just because of the language that we used to talk about, reasoning is very militaristic. We will talk about shooting down an argument or about poking holes in someone's logic.
We talked about our beliefs as if they are these fortresses that we have to buttress or support with evidence or strengthen against attack. So I call that soldier mindset. Then scout mindset is this alternative way of thinking and reasoning because the scouts' role, unlike the soldier, is not to attack or defend, its to go out, try to see what's really out there, what's really true and put together as accurate a map as possible of a situation or the landscape. Being in a scout mindset just means reasoning with the goal of actually figuring out what's true to the best of your ability, being as objective and intellectually honest as you can. That doesn't mean that you don't have preferences about what's true like you might hope that your investment is going to do well, or you might hope that in the metaphor of the scout that there is like a bridge across the river where you need to cross, but above all, you want to know what is actually true. You don't want to draw a bridge on your map where there isn't one in reality. That's the soldier and scout mindset.
Maria Gallagher: That's awesome. I hadn't really thought about these types of militarism, how strong the language is around defending our beliefs until I read your book. Once you start seeing it, I was having a conversation with a friend the other day and I realized I was getting so defensive about it, a belief I held and I realized I was using this quite intense language, and so I think that's really fascinating. As investors, we've talked a lot about things like confirmation bias, which is seeking out information that confirms your opinions or even survivorship bias. You remember the stories of the Amazon that survived the 2001 Internet bubble but you don't think as much about the many companies that didn't and so how would you kind of compare and contrast the ideas of motivated reasoning with those ideas of confirmation bias as well?
Galef: That's a great question because the terms are often used loosely or interchangeably and there is a lot of overlap between confirmation bias and soldier mindset or motivated reasoning. On the other hand, they're not quite the same thing. Confirmation bias officially is reasoning or processing evidence in such a way that confirms what you expect is true, whereas motivated reasoning is processing evidence in the way that confirms what you want to be true. So it's expect versus want. Again, that can often overlap. An example where they wouldn't overlap might be, suppose for whatever reason you suspect that your friend is depressed and there's a party and your friend doesn't show up for the party and so you think to yourself, it must be because my friends is depressed, she didn't feel like coming to the party and maybe, but there's lots of reasons why someone might not come to a party and the fact that someone didn't show up isn't that strong evidence of depression, but because that's when you expect to see, that's how you interpret the new evidence but it's not that you want your friends to be depressed. It's just interpreting evidence in a manner that's consistent with your expectations. That would be confirmation bias but not motivated reasoning.
Gallagher: Something that's interesting too when you talk about in your book, you talk about some business leaders. You talk about Elon Musk starting Tesla, that he thought it would probably fail. Jeff Bezos started Amazon, he gave himself about a 30% chance of success and he shared with investors.
Galef: On the media.
Gallagher: We think of them as confident leaders. How do you kind of think about leadership as it comes to these types of mindsets and then how they talk to the public and they talk to their companies and the media?
Galef: I find the stories of the early days of Tesla and SpaceX and Amazon fascinating because they undermined this common wisdom that people have. Which is that leaders, in order to be a successful leader, in order to be influential and to inspire people to work for you and fund you and just like cover you in the media, you need to just be certain in all of your opinions, you need to express certainty that your plans will succeed. That's what confidence is. The fact that these two extremely successful entrepreneurs and very influential people of Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk actively went against that advice and expressed low confidence in the success of their companies. Elon Musk, I think, gave both Tesla and SpaceX a 10% chance of success. He was very open about that and Jeff Bezos gave Amazon a 30% chance of success, which is still relatively high compared to the base rate of start-up success, but like well below what a typical entrepreneur says about his company starting out. I think it's very interesting that they are counterexamples to that common wisdom. So the question is why? How are they so successful and influential despite expressing low confidence?
The answer is that there are two different things that we're conflating when we talk about confidence. One type of confidence is what I call epistemic confidence, and that's about how much certainty you express in your beliefs or in your predictions about whether your company will succeed. Bezos and Musk both expressed low epistemic confidence in their project success where their company is. Then another type of confidence is just social confidence. Are you self-assured? Are you charismatic? Do you seem comfortable taking charge and making things happen and speaking in front of groups? Things like that. People conflate those two but actually if you look at the evidence, both anecdotal and the studies that we have, the thing that matters to whether people see you as an influential leader is social confidence, and both Musk and Bezos have lots of social confidence. It's one of the things people tend to remark on about them when they first meet them, and so that's all you need, which is great. That's the great news because people all along have been thinking, in order to be influential, I have to convince myself that I'm certain about everything even when there isn't actually good evidence, even when I can't justifiably be 100% certain. Being a good scout means you're going to be uncertain about a lot of things because you can't actually justify 100% confidence in a lot of things, especially in messy unknowable things like whether your company will succeed. So it's good news. You don't actually have to express 100% certainty in order to be a confident leader, you just need to cultivate social confidence.
Gallagher: While you were doing research for your book, was there anything that really surprised you and shocked you a little bit as you were researching these mindsets?
Galef: In this main, something that surprised me, but I don't think ends up including the book actually is a different bit of common wisdom that I would often hear is that the public doesn't want to hear uncertainty from scientific experts, like public health experts speaking about COVID or scientist speaking about climate change. Public hates them, in fact they just want definitive answers from scientists. I've had that a million times. When I actually looked into the evidence, that's not true. I read a bunch of studies that measured people's reaction to uncertainty from scientific experts. In the vast majority of them, the result was actually bimodal. In all these studies, a significant minority of people like 30 or 40% who don't like uncertainty, and if they hear and uncertain statements from scientists, they will report having lowered their trust in the scientist or lower their confidence in science. But then there's also another often bigger group of people like 40 or 50% who like hearing uncertainty from scientists and find that that increases their trust in scientists and the scientific process. When interviewed, people in the second group will often say, you can't actually be 100% certain. If a scientist says yes and I don't trust them. It's actually a more nuanced situation than people made it sound, and I've started to wonder if maybe scientists haven't been on wisely optimizing just for the first group of the uncertainty averse people when actually there's often bigger group of people who would be happy to hear uncertainties if it's warranted. That was surprising and interesting to me.
Gallagher: That is very surprising. I would assume that they would be the exception to the rule and that most people would not want scientists to show any doubt. But that's really fascinating.
Galef: I don't think that's what I had heard when I assumed.
Gallagher: I wonder what group I would fall into. I feel like I don't want doctors to be uncertain, but maybe I would feel like I was refreshed with their honesty if they were.
Galef: It depends on the uncertainty. There's a certain uncertainty, the results of ignorance like if a doctor says, I've never seen anything like this. I don't know what it could be. Then you're like, maybe there's a better doctor out there that [laughs] I'm going to find. Then there's a different uncertainty, again, in studies people react well to, which is like, OK, here is what is known about your condition. The diagnosis is hard to predict as of now, but I can tell you the factors that tend to make it more or less likely that you'll have a good outcome, but it's not guaranteed. When a doctor explains the uncertainty in detail like that, what they're doing is they're demonstrating that the uncertainty is not the fault of their own ignorance. It's just the world is messy and things are often unknowable and they're showing you that they understand the uncertainty and they can map it out for you. That tends to make someone looks like more of an expert, not less. That'll be my prediction about how you would react if a doctor expressed uncertainty to you.
Gallagher: Yeah, that's really fascinating. I know we only have a couple of minutes left, so I was just wondering to finish off of what's one thing that investors and people should start to implement and their daily life to work on, to start having more that scout mindset to looking for the truth no matter what your initial opinions are going to be?
Galef: Yes, I'd say one category of technique called Bates' Scout Mindset is the thought experiments, which I mentioned earlier. That could look like the outsider tests. Another one is the status quo bias tests where you flip around the status quo to see if you were motivated to stick to whatever the status quo was, even if it's not actually best. You might ask yourselves like, maybe I don't think it's wise to sell, but if I imagine I didn't actually already own the stock, what I want to buy it, that can often flip things around an interesting way. Another category of technique is just finding ways of making ourselves more open or receptive to the truth. Even if it's not what you wish, it was.
The way that I usually do that is before I ask myself if something is true, I'll instead imagine, suppose it is true. How bad would that be, or what would I do about it? If I'm in an argument online and I start to think, oh, I wonder if I'm wrong, the temptation is to push that thought out of my mind and just focus on ways to defend my position. But instead, I'll also stop and ask myself, OK, suppose I was wrong. How bad would that be or how would I say it? Often in just a couple of seconds I can come up with a draft freezing, but I could say that I would be happy with and I'm like, I don't think our views about than wrong with four people didn't turn my head off. That just a couple of seconds and then I just feel much more willing to consider the possibility that I am wrong because I feel like it would be fine, I can handle it. Same thing for if you start to worry that maybe you made the wrong call at work or maybe you shouldn't have bought that stock or something. Before you try to think about whether that's true, first ask yourself, suppose were true, what would I do, and try to get into a state where you feel like, OK I could handle that if that were true, and only then will you have the freedom to think honestly about whether or not it is true. I found that really helpful as well.
Gallagher: That is really helpful, I think, especially as investors, when you look at your overall portfolio, a winning portfolio is only right about 60% of the time. There is no way that I'm going to exclusively pick companies that are always going to win. I think having that mindset means, OK, my thesis is wrong, what does that mean? My thesis has been wrong before and it's looking at it as a learning opportunity and think, what does that mean for the next time I look at a biotech company, what are these red flags I'm going to make sure I pay attention to next time, and having that growth mindset of always trying to learn and grow. You're wrong about things as we all are, as the world is a messy and confusing place to be an investor and to be a person.
Galef: Right. I could pick one takeaway, it would be that shift in your thinking about what it even means to be wrong because we tend to just implicitly think, but if I'm wrong, it means I did something wrong. I screwed up somehow. Sometimes you're wrong because you screwed up. Like maybe you were really negligent and you didn't do enough due diligence for you about the stock and go, hey, is part of the mistake, I should've known better. But a lot of the time you made the best call you could have given the information you had at the time and you shouldn't feel bad about that. The metaphor of the scout, we all have these imperfect incomplete maps. They're wrong necessarily because we're not on mission. Over time our goal is to get more information and revise them up and make it less wrong, and that's the best we can do as humans.
Hill: The book is The Scout Mindset: Why Some People See Things Clearly And Others Don't.
It's time to get to the stocks on our radar. Our man behind the glass, Dan Boyd, is going to hit you with a question. Jason Moser, you're up first, what are you looking at this week?
Moser: Yeah. Just taken a look at Outset Medical, the ticker is OM. They are responsible for the tableau hemodialysis system. I know it's helpful. It allows for dialysis, believe it or not, to be delivered anytime, anywhere and by anyone, and in fact, it's the only hemodialysis system on the market with FDA clearance for two-way wireless data transmission. But it's got a lovely razor and blade model where recently console revenue grew by 106% from a year ago, consumable revenue was up 150% from a year ago. They did report for the second quarter $25.2 million in total revenue. That was revenue growth of 115% from a year ago as well. Secured sales agreements with seven of the eight largest national health systems. Raising guidance modestly could be looking to cross that $100 million in revenue mark this year. This is a very young business. It is just getting started. Clearly, valuation is going to be one of the bigger risks in the near term. But it's a tremendous market opportunity; it really doesn't look like they're proving their case. It's one I own myself. I remain very excited about its potential.
Hill: Dan, question about Outset Medical?
Dan Boyd: Certainly, Chris. Jason, since inception, the stock has been flat to a little bit down. Is the time to strike now for Outset Medical?
Moser: I think so, Dan. Like I said, valuation being one of the bigger risks, but they are pursuing a very big market opportunity, one that is not going to go away. As we see more moves toward that hospital in the home and telemedicine. This is a business playing in the basic Sandbox, so to speak.
Hill: Ron Gross, what are you looking at this week?
Gross: I've got bluebird bio, ticker symbol BLUE. One of the stocks in my personal biotech basket, but I need to keep a close eye on this one. It got crushed on Monday, down about 25% in one day. The FDA paused one of its gene therapy studies due to concerns that one of its therapies contributed to a patient getting cancer, obviously very serious, that needs to be investigated. The company also confirmed its plans to separate into two separate companies, one to focus on gene therapy, one to focus on oncology. May also plans to pull out of direct selling in Europe, so a lot of news on that one day. I'm still hanging onto this one for now. But this stresses the importance of buying companies like this in a basket. This is one of nine companies I own in the space, and even though the stock got crushed, that basket as a whole was actually up on the day.
Hill: Dan, question about bluebird bio?
Boyd: This is one of those stocks that Ron brings every now and then, where I think he's bringing it to show us how bad things can get when a company has a ton going forward and then loses 25% in one day.
Hill: What do you want to add to your watch list?
Gross: Here's that basket approach, Danny.
Boyd: Well, it's certainly not bluebird bio, I am going to go with Outset Medical here.
Hill: Ron Gross, Jason Moser, guys, thanks for being in here.
Moser: Thank you, Chris.
Hill: That's going to do it for this week's show, we're out of time. We'll see you next week.

2021-08-21 00:00:00+00:00,"For Amazon and eBay, Advertising Is Another Way to Raise Fees on Sellers",EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/for-amazon-and-ebay-advertising-is-another-way-to-raise-fees-on-sellers-2021-08-21,,,"For Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY), advertising is becoming a lucrative source of revenue. Each hosts over 100 million ready buyers with payment information on file that marketers covet access to.
However, many of the businesses that advertise on Amazon and eBay are also sellers on the sites. This means that spending on promoting products on the platforms is increasing the cost of operations.

Prime real estate
In its fiscal second quarter, Amazon reported an 83% increase in revenue from the same quarter last year in a segment consisting mostly of advertising. The division has reported over $7 billion in revenue in each of the last three quarters. Some of this spending goes to streaming TV ads and on Amazon's Twitch gaming service. The rest is spending to get prized real estate on Amazon.com.
A seller of phone covers wants to reach the top spot in search results on Amazon.com. For this privilege, it can pay to be a sponsored product that shows up near the top of results. With more than 200 million Prime members who are one click away from purchasing, businesses want access to that buying power. Scroll a bit further down, and you will find more sponsored products based on the same search.
Businesses already pay Amazon a percentage of each sale made on the site. So Amazon's advertising is another way to raise fees on sellers. Consider that my search for phone covers would produce a certain number of results without the sponsored product feature. The sponsored product feature produces similar results, but some businesses now pay to show up higher on my search query. Competitors observe spending by rivals and decide to either ramp up spending or suffer a lower ranking.
Bidding for position
Similarly, eBay is bringing in more ad revenue. Management said, ""In Q2, ad revenue outpaced volume driven by Promoted Listings, which delivered almost $224 million, up 8%. More than 1.4 million sellers promoted over 430 million listings during the quarter."" Again, businesses are spending to get preferential placement in search results. If you don't pay, you get outranked by competitors that do.
Like Amazon, sellers on eBay pay a percentage of sales to the company. That percentage (take rate) has been steadily increasing on eBay over the last several quarters, rising from 9.2% in Q2 2020 to 11.3% in Q2 2021. And it was the main reason eBay increased revenue in the most recent quarter, while spending on its site decreased.
Investor takeaway
The size and scope of eBay and Amazon give them the pricing power to extract an increasing share of sales from sellers on their sites. However, the strategy comes with risks. It could give sellers a reason to take their products off the platforms and go someplace else. Reopening economies will allow some businesses to recoup sales through brick-and-mortar channels. For digitally native businesses, other solutions like Shopify may become more attractive.
Investors will want to watch closely and make sure Amazon and eBay tread carefully to avoid alienating sellers on the platforms.

2021-08-20 00:00:00+00:00,2 Growth Stocks I'd Buy Right Now,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/2-growth-stocks-id-buy-right-now-2021-08-20,,,"Investing in growth stocks is one of the most effective ways to build wealth. The only problem is that they can be volatile when earnings results don't quite satisfy the high expectations that are usually embedded in their lofty valuations.
But I never sweat these episodes, because I have found that investors have a tendency to underestimate how much particular companies can grow over long periods of time. The strongest companies keep on finding ways to grow, which can lead to huge gains for investors who remain patient through thick and thin.
Two growth stocks I would buy today are MercadoLibre (NASDAQ: MELI) and TE Connectivity (NYSE: TEL). Both companies have plenty of opportunities to keep expanding in their respective markets and should deliver above-average returns.
Image source: Getty Images.
MercadoLibre
MercadoLibre should be on your radar if it isn't already. It's the digital commerce leader in Latin America, one of the fastest-growing e-commerce markets in the world, and the business has performed like it.
MercadoLibre has consistently reported phenomenal revenue growth for a long time, and investors have reaped the rewards. The shares are up 950% in just the last five years. If you think it's too late to jump on board, consider its recent performance.
In the second quarter, currency-neutral revenue growth clocked in at 102% year over year, which doesn't look like a business that is done growing by a long shot. Over the last five years, revenue has grown more than sevenfold, which has pushed the stock higher.
The company operates across several segments, including marketplace, advertising services, logistics solutions, and mobile payments. It's sort of like eBay and PayPal Holdings all in one. Expanding its Mercado Pago payments business to non-marketplace transactions is one area where it has had tremendous success. Off-platform payment volume, which counts the transactions made away from MercadoLibre's marketplace business, grew 93% year over year in the second quarter in local currency.
Management is investing aggressively to grow its user base. It currently has 75 million unique active users across its platform, but there are more than 450 million internet users across Latin America and the Caribbean. Operating expenses, including product development and marketing, increased 79% last quarter, which is pressuring profits, but should lead to further growth in users, buying frequency, and revenue.
MercadoLibre looks expensive at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 571, but its price-to-sales multiple of 15.9 shows that it should be priced about right once management backs off the high marketing spending and lets more profit shine through. By comparison, Mercado's U.S.-based counterpart PayPal trades at 13.5 times trailing sales, but MercadoLibre is growing much faster, which justifies its higher valuation.
Investing behind the growth of e-commerce seems like a smart bet, and MercadoLibre is one of the best horses to bet on in this race.
TE Connectivity
TE Connectivity is a leader in providing connectors, sensors, cables, and other products for the transportation, industrial, and communications markets. The stock has more than doubled over the last five years, but given increasing demand from automated factories, data centers, and adoption of electric vehicles (EVs), TE Connectivity should continue earning shareholders above-average returns.
Like many economically sensitive companies, TE Connectivity saw sales dip last year as COVID-19 disrupted supply chains and operations. But revenue has accelerated since the start of fiscal 2021 in September, climbing 6% on an adjusted basis year over year in the fiscal first quarter, followed by 11% in the second quarter, and 45% in the third.
These results show the company is well positioned to continue benefiting from the secular demand trends in EV technology, medical needs, smart buildings, and high-speed data centers.
While TE Connectivity carries more debt than cash on its balance sheet, it generated $2 billion in free cash flow on $14.4 billion in revenue over the last four quarters. It also pays a regular dividend of $0.50 per share every quarter, bringing the dividend yield to 1.4% at the current quote.
Analysts expect TE Connectivity to post growth in EPS of 52% this year and 9% next year. Investors who are hesitant to buy MercadoLibre because of its expensive valuation should find TE Connectivity's forward P/E of 22.8 more appealing, which looks like a decent value relative to growth expectations.

2021-08-20 00:00:00+00:00,3 Top Stocks That Are Cash Cows,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-top-stocks-that-are-cash-cows-2021-08-20,,,"There's a long list of ways in which a company's reported earnings can fail to reflect the true performance of the business. These include one-time write-offs, tax adjustments, and accounting charges, just to name a few. Management teams can sometimes make decisions that juice reported earnings (for example, through asset sales) at the expense of long-term profitability.
That's why many investors choose to put a premium on cash flow metrics, which can paint a more reliable picture of the business. With that goal in mind, let's look at three companies -- eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY), Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX), and McDonald's (NYSE: MCD) -- that are minting cash so far in 2021.

eBay is awash in cash
The e-commerce niche has been a great place to have a leadership position during the pandemic. Buyers and sellers both flocked toward digital platforms in ways that only accelerated the long-term shift toward that selling channel.
But eBay stands out as a particularly strong cash producer. Free cash flow (FCF) this past quarter edged up to a whopping 34% of sales, far greater than what peers like Walmart and Amazon can manage. eBay's middleman selling approach helps on this score, with earnings boosted by fees it charges to sellers that use its platform.
That seller-fee level recently crossed into the double digits and could keep climbing as eBay adds value to its service through offerings like promoted listings and payments processing. Look for accelerating cash returns through late 2021 as a natural consequence of these successes.
Netflix is improving
Achieving positive cash flow can often take many years for a start-up, but the results can be dramatic for those companies that get it right. Netflix is a great example today. The streaming video giant's annual cash losses moved steadily toward $2 billion before recently rocketing up to gains of over $2 billion.

Yes, part of that spike came from a temporary pause in spending during the pandemic. But Netflix is targeting positive cash flow in 2021, with improving results likely for the foreseeable future. The roughly 15% FCF margin that the company briefly achieved last year is not just indicative of its long-term potential, but ""just the start,"" according to CFO Spencer Neumann. The stock's performance might track closely with that rising cash rate in 2021 and beyond.
McDonald's has it all
It's good to be the leader in a massive global industry. But McDonald's pairs that attractive positioning with a uniquely strong operating model. The fast-food giant's franchise approach delivers stable (and rising) royalties, rents, and fees, which through the first half of 2021 helped generate $3.9 billion of operating cash compared to $11 billion of revenue.
That setup only works if you can keep several groups happy at the same time, namely, customers and franchisees. Mickey D's has proved its ability to do just that through a wide range of selling conditions and demand swings. The chain adjusted to a pivot toward healthier, less-processed food in recent years, and it is currently making a similarly large shift toward digital ordering and home delivery.
Through all those moves, cash flow has been a comforting hedge against the normal risks associated with the restaurant industry. And that steady resource stream should support further market-beating gains for shareholders from here.

2021-08-20 00:00:00+00:00,3 Major Takeaways From Wish's Latest Earnings,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-major-takeaways-from-wishs-latest-earnings-2021-08-20,,,"Online retailer Wish -- which trades as ContextLogic (NASDAQ: WISH) -- must be wishing it could take a mulligan. Wish reported a huge earnings miss last week, and shares crashed over 20% following the announcement.
At $6.87, the stock is down more than 60% year to date and far below its $24 initial public offering price. Clearly, investors in Wish -- including me -- are disappointed with how things have turned out.
But beyond the headlines, Wish's latest earnings release offers some reasons to be hopeful. So let's take a closer look at Wish's results -- and what could lie ahead for this company.
Image source: Getty Images.
What went wrong for Wish
Wish posted revenue of $656 million for the second quarter of 2021, down 6% year over year. Wish reported a loss of $67 million on an adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) basis, compared to a profit of $16 million a year ago. Both top-line and bottom-line figures missed Wish's guidance of $715 million in revenue and adjusted EBITDA of negative $60 million.
For investors, that's a shocking turn of events. After all, Wish had posted a 75% revenue surge in the first quarter of 2021, beating management and street forecasts.
So what went wrong? For a start, the global economy is gradually reopening thanks to rising vaccination rates. As a result, consumers are spending less time at home, leading to a slowdown in online shopping. For Wish, this meant fewer app installs, declining daily user activity, and lower sales.
On top of declining user engagement, the cost of digital ads -- a key driver of sales for Wish -- surged during the quarter. Wish says this was because Apple's privacy updates pushed marketers to spend more on ads targeting Android users, intensifying competition for ad space. That was bad news for Wish. The company's ads have historically targeted Android users, given that they make up the bulk of its customers. Moreover, Wish uses data-driven algorithms to manage its ad spend -- and these algorithms are designed to chase a higher return on the marketing investment. Unfortunately, rising ad costs meant this strategy was no longer as efficient as it once was. So Wish's algorithms reacted by slashing the amount it spent on ads. This dented user growth and crippled Wish's ability to engage its existing users.
Coupled with reopening headwinds, the pullback in ad spend led to a 13% drop in app installs, along with a 15% decrease in time spent on Wish. In turn, this resulted in a 22% drop in monthly active users to 90 million. Furthermore, active buyers -- users who bought at least one product during the quarter -- plunged 44% to 17 million.
A silver lining
All in all, this was an extremely challenging quarter for Wish. But it's not all doom and gloom for this company.
Despite the drop in engagement and user metrics, Wish's revenue per buyer rose to $22, up 21% from a year ago. In other words, while fewer customers spent time and money on Wish, those who did use the platform spent more. This suggests Wish may have struck a chord among its biggest fans -- and that's a positive sign. The question is whether Wish can build on this success and convert more users into loyal ones.
Another bright spot for Wish was its logistics division, which aims to provide merchants with a cost-effective and reliable way to deliver products to international customers. Revenue at this segment jumped 126% to $228 million, driven by surging demand from merchants in Wish's network. Wish's Local service -- a network of 60,000 brick-and-mortar stores linked to Wish's online marketplace -- also showed signs of growth. Orders shipped to Local partners made up about 10% of Wish's total orders, up from 7% three months ago.
What's next for Wish
Wish is not taking its challenges lying down. Instead, the company is taking radical steps to improve user engagement and retention, aiming to return to growth sooner rather than later.
For a start, Wish plans to introduce more globally recognized brands onto its marketplace. It is also overhauling its algorithms to prioritize products and merchants with more positive user ratings, boosting the quality of products sold on its platform. Wish also wants to improve its user experience by rolling out social commerce and entertaining features such as live-streaming and video reviews. Lifting a page from the playbooks of social commerce specialists like Pinduoduo and Douyin could help Wish retain existing shoppers -- and attract new ones.
To achieve these goals, Wish will draw on its increasingly deep bench of experienced leaders. For example, the company recently named former Alphabet executives Farhang Kassaei and Tarun Jain as chief technology officer and chief product officer. A former senior director of software engineering at Alphabet's Google unit, Kassaei has also spent time at eBay, where he was the chief architect of the marketplace. Jain was most recently director of product management at Google, where he worked on YouTube's and Gmail's ad platforms. By bringing in these two seasoned tech executives, Wish may have a better shot at success.
What Wish investors should look for
But all these initiatives will take time. Wish does not think its efforts will yield fruit until the second half of 2022, so investors will have to exercise patience. In fact, Wish expects its performance to deteriorate in the third quarter -- thanks to the cutback in ad spending. Quarter-to-date revenue in July 2021 is already down 40% year over year -- and Wish is guiding for an adjusted EBITDA loss in the third quarter of between $65 million and $70 million.
As an investor in Wish, I'm not satisfied with its recent performance. Still, if this journey plays out as Wish hopes it will, the company could emerge in a stronger position. To see if Wish can pull this off, I'll be keeping an eye on its user growth metrics -- such as MAUs and active buyers -- over the next few quarters. This will give me a better idea of whether Wish is on the road to success.

Recent performance
Valuation is always important to consider when evaluating a stock's potential upside. eBay trades at 19 times the consensus earnings estimate for 2021, which is below the S&P 500 average forward earnings multiple of 22. The stock could be marginally undervalued, depending on how much eBay continues to grow over the long term.
However, eBay is facing tougher year-over-year growth comparisons this year. In the second quarter, revenue grew 11% on a currency-neutral basis, which is down from 42% in the first quarter and 30% in the year-ago quarter. In the third quarter, management expects revenue to grow 6% to 8% on a currency-neutral basis over the year-ago quarter.
The stock price is up 7.1% since the earnings report on Aug. 11, but with growth decelerating, it's difficult to say whether the stock will continue to head higher in the near term. But eBay could reaccelerate its revenue growth in 2022, based on management's strategy to improve the marketplace business.
Pursuing the big spenders
CEO Jamie Iannone took over in April 2020 and has brought plenty of experience with him after working as chief operating officer of Walmart's e-commerce business. eBay is facing mounting pressure from new rivals, such as Etsy, which posted triple-digit revenue growth in 2020 and added 35.5 million new active buyers. That's more than triple eBay's active buyer increase of 11 million during 2020.
eBay has reported strong results from new categories in recent quarters, including authenticated sneakers, trading cards, and luxury watches. Trading cards, for example, generated $2 billion in gross merchandise volume (GMV) in the first half of the year, and Iannone sees ""untapped potential"" for further growth in the category.
Still, $2 billion of GMV is not much compared to eBay's total GMV of $22 billion in the last quarter, but there is more to the strategy with the recent category expansions. The goal here is to offer more in-demand items that appeal to young people, especially those Gen Z and millennials that like to shop frequently.
Before Iannone joined the company, eBay was focused on growing total active buyers with no consideration to the quality of its customers in terms of how engaged they are and how much they spend. The result was that active buyer growth was slowing to just 1% right before the pandemic in Q1 2020. Basically, Iannone wants to reduce dependency on what he refers to as ""one and done buyers"" and focus on bringing in ""lifelong enthusiasts"" to the marketplace to stimulate better growth, which is already showing promise.
For example, eBay has found that a Gen Z shopper will buy a $500 sneaker, but then spend another $2,000 in goods across other categories. Iannone explained as much during eBay's Q2 earnings call:
We're seeing [the] same thing in watches where a luxury watch buyer is buying $8,000 in categories outside of watches and that's over 50 items, and that's one of the benefits of eBay is that cross-category shopping nature, and that's really hard for other competitors to replicate.
While eBay's active buyer count declined sequentially by 7 million to 159 million in the quarter, that's still a wide customer reach and mirrors the broad selection of goods eBay has to offer as it pursues higher-value buyers.
""These high-volume buyers are growing compared to a year ago, and their spend on eBay is growing even faster,"" Iannone said. ""This higher-quality mix of buyers increases value for sellers and will lead to improved health of our ecosystem over the long term.""

Don't count eBay out
If eBay can bring in more high-volume buyers to the marketplace, that would attract more sellers. This, in turn, would lead to greater merchandise selection, which would also help attract more buyers and create a flywheel of growth.
Iannone has breathed new life into eBay, which I believe makes the stock worth considering even after the gains over the last year. There are faster-growing online retail stocks, but eBay is not going away. It generates healthy levels of free cash flow that it is returning to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. eBay's free cash flow amounted to $2.9 billion over the last year, which is a high margin of 29% compared to total revenue of $10 billion.
It is not too late to invest in eBay. If management continues to succeed at bringing in younger shoppers, the stock could deliver market-beating gains from here.

The online marketplace recently announced solid growth in its core businesses despite a slowdown compared to 2020.
In a conference call with Wall Street analysts, CEO Jamie Iannone and his team broke down those results and explained why they're optimistic about being able to send a flood of cash toward shareholders in 2021 and beyond. Here are three highlights from that presentation.
Image source: Getty Images.
Staying on target
eBay's 11% sales growth edged past management's prior outlook that called for 8% to 10% revenue gains this quarter. Sure, several key growth metrics turned negative compared to the pandemic spike, including the change in the buyer pool, operating margin, and transaction volume. But executives cast the results in a wider time frame by highlighting organic growth, the slimmer portfolio, and gains in customer satisfaction.
""Our priorities [a year ago] were to grow the core, become the platform of choice for sellers, and to cultivate lifelong trusted relationships with buyers by turning them into enthusiasts,"" Iannone said. ""To date our progress is very encouraging."" eBay said it is seeing organic volume growth compared to 2019 while enjoying a lift from its new advertising and payments niches.
Returning more cash
eBay closed its deal to sell its classifieds business at a higher price than initially forecast. That success, plus other financial wins such as booming payments revenue and rising seller fees, has management extolling the benefits of the company's operating model.
""We saw another strong quarter of cash generation,"" CFO Steve Priest said. Free cash flow came in at a whopping 34% of revenue, up from 33% last quarter. Priest pointed out the ""incredible durability of the financial model with ... best-in-class margins [and] incredible free cash flow.""
Most of that extra cash is going straight to investors through stock buybacks and an increasing dividend payment.
Growth through the pandemic
The company's updated outlook calls for another growth slowdown in Q3, with sales volumes again falling at a double-digit rate. Management estimates that this will still mark a high-single-digit annual volume increase compared to 2019, before the pandemic scrambled demand trends. At the same time, eBay is benefiting from its growing advertising and payments niches, and from improvements to the platform that allow it to charge higher seller fees.
Overall, operating margin should land at 33% of sales this year, up nearly 2 percentage points since 2019.
Executives say they're even more excited about the company's long-term growth potential. Recent wins in attractive product areas like trading cards, luxury watches, and collectable sneakers provide a framework eBay can use in dozens of other niches.
Keeping buyers happy will be the key to achieving these wins, and that's why investors will want to watch customer satisfaction while following the long-term trend in buyer engagement. In the meantime, look for eBay to significantly ramp up its cash returns as it reallocates windfall gains from its recent divestments. The company is aiming to spend roughly $3.2 billion on stock repurchases over the next six months, compared to $1.7 billion in the first half of 2021.

This video was recorded on Aug. 5, 2021.
Chris Hill: It's Thursday, Aug. 5. Welcome to MarketFoolery, I'm Chris Hill. With me today for the first time in awhile, Mr. Ron Gross, thanks for being here.
Ron Gross: Always a pleasure, Chris. I'm sorry, it's been awhile. Things get busy here and there, but I'm always happy to be here.
Hill: You're busy, you're like, unlike me. You actually have people you manage, you have a team you manage.
Gross: It is my pleasure to do so.
Hill: That is the right thing to say out loud into a microphone. Earning season rolls on. We've got stocks for your home, for travel. We're going to start with retail. Etsy's second-quarter profits and revenue came in higher than expected. Revenue growth year over year was 23%, which seems pretty good, and yet it really wasn't good enough for Wall Street because shares of Etsy are down 6%.
Gross: Is anything really ever good enough for Wall Street? Sometimes, I guess.
Hill: Every now and then it is, this is one where I think before I even let you weigh in on what you thought of the quarter, I think it's important to get a grip on the guidance that they gave because I haven't looked closely enough to wonder whether or not, the guidance they gave for the rest of the year merits this type of drop today.
Gross: OK. We can skip to the end, I'd like to save guidance for last, but I'm going to help you out here and talk about guidance. One sentence from the transcript that management noted was that comps get tougher as they progress through 2021. There is a signal to investors that things are going to be ""anniversarying"" very exciting quarters from last year, and things are going to get tougher. Especially considering the absence of masks, which was a huge driver of Etsy revenue last year, and the absence of stimulus checks. These are all things that are banging up against demand, and when you compare it to the really strong numbers of last year, it gets everybody a little bit worried. I find it interesting because you should realize, obviously if you're looking at an online retailer that there's ""anniversarying"" of pandemic results that are going to happen, and as long as there's no impairment of the business and things look on track, then you really shouldn't be that concerned.
In fact, when you think about someone like Etsy, they got to pull forward 38 million new buyers in 2020. The fact that active buying growth is slowing now, which is what Wall Street is also focused on, that's bothering people. It shouldn't bother you because they got to 38 million people in a year earlier than they probably would have. Money earlier is always better than money later. That's a phrase I like to live by. As long as the pull-forward doesn't impact your business later on, there's nothing wrong with it happening earlier. There's a lot of folks, investors focusing on the guidance and the fact that active buying growth is slowing. But I think things look pretty good here. For the quarter, consolidated gross merchandise sales, GMS, for short, up 13%. That's fine in this environment. If you remove the impact of masks, Etsy's stand-alone business grew 31% year over year. Again, strong results on a two-year basis, that's 153% growth if you remove masks. Things are fine here, revenue up 23%. They did add 8 million new buyers. Again, that's less than people would like to see because they're used to seeing that huge growth from last year. I think that's unrealistic to expect that. Active buying on a trailing-12-month basis was up 22%. Merchandise sales per active buyer up 22%. That's actually a nice offset to the fact that active buyer growth is slowing. You saw net income tick up a bit to about 2%. They're making a lot of moves. They're improving the buying experience, they're improving customer service. They made two acquisitions that just closed, one in the resale space, vintage space, Elo7, which is known as the Etsy of Brazil, so expanding internationally as well. I don't think the stock should be really taking a hit on this. I don't see anything that's troubling.
Hill: I just hope nobody is surprised. I mean, just don't tell me any investor is surprised for Etsy or any as you indicated, any online retailer that they're coming up on tough comps. If you don't already know that, then you are clearly not paying attention. For better or for worse, the whole thing of masks and people buying masks off of Etsy, I don't know if you've looked at the headlines recently, but masks sales might be ticking back up over the next like six months.
Gross: That is so true. Yes, exactly. Have you ever personally bought anything on Etsy?
Hill: Not a mask, but sure I've bought stuff on Etsy a few times. Yeah, it's a great experience and it's stuff you can't really find anywhere else. I mean, I think that's part of what's compelling about this business.
Gross: If you're looking for something that you can't readily find somewhere else, is Etsy your first shot or is eBay your first shot?
Hill: I will go to Etsy before I go to eBay.
Gross: OK.
Hill: But I will probably go to Target.com before I go to either of them, depending on what the item is. Just because I think, and I've said this before, I think Target really did an amazing job over the last year and a half of investing in their digital platform and just making it so much more seamless with their stores.
Gross: Yeah, great. Mark Tritton getting it done and then leaving.
Hill: Exactly. Booking Holdings' loss in the second quarter was wider than expected, but revenue looked good. Demand for travel is on the rise and shares of bookings up 7% as well today.
Gross: Again, this is like the other side of the Etsy coin. Nobody should really be surprised that there was pent-up demand for travel and it's coming back now. That's showing up in the numbers. Quarterly revenue more than tripled, easily beating expectations. Second-quarter gross travel bookings up 852%. The number of room night reservations grew 458% year over year, and 59% sequentially from the first quarter. All really strong numbers. It's mostly because of strong demand in Europe, and then the U.S. as again, people start traveling and vacationing. Asia, where vaccinations were lowest and cases were highest, was the least recovered region. I think once that rebounds you'll start to see even stronger numbers.
Overall, this was the first positive year-over-year growth since before the start of their pandemic. Again, not surprising. Interestingly, demand for accommodations in homes versus hotels is increasing as people are still looking to stay away from the crowds and getting that more of an Airbnb-type experience, if you will. Company still lost money, but it's narrowing to about $100 million was their adjusted net loss. I think delta, as you mentioned earlier, the delta variant, that's a wild card here for the next several months, at least, I think if people start to go back down a little bit into lockdown mode, lockdown might be too big a word there, but I know I'm back to wearing my masks in places I wasn't. I'm more hesitant to go into restaurants, I'm more hesitant maybe to travel. It will be interesting to see if I'm indicative of the rest of the Booking customer base.
Hill: When you think about guidance that we get from companies, where does Booking Holdings fall in the travel space for you? Because obviously, we as investors get a lot of information. It seems from the airlines in terms of the individual airlines, them as a category in terms of flights, in terms of TSA check-ins, all that things. It would seem on the surface like Booking Holdings gives you not only insight into air travel, but lodging as you indicated, as well as car rentals?
Gross: For sure it would, if they were forthcoming with a lot of granularity, and a lot of good guidance. I'm not seeing that from a lot of companies right now, including Booking. But sure, when you book of vacation two months from now or airfare two months from now, it's a good leading indicator of what things may look in the next quarter or the next two quarters, and anything we can glean from these companies where you buying now, and use later, inform us as to how the rest of the year will look.
Hill: I have more questions on travel, but then it would turn into an episode of Industry Focus.
Gross: What, I have a similar question to my Etsy question. Are you a person that books travel, or hotels through these booking Expedia-type websites, or do you go directly to the hotel?
Hill: I have no brand loyalty when it comes to travel. I'm not a member of Bonvoy or whatever Marriott is calling their rewards programs. I am very single-focused on, I have this trip, I will look at different airlines, I will look at different websites, including individual hotel websites, I'll use Expedia, anything. None of them have won me over in the way that other businesses, and other categories have won me over.
Gross: I think you're probably more normal than me. I tend to go directly to Marriott, for example, because I am part of the Bonvoy program, and you get the points, the rewards, and you're trying to work the system, and get the best deal you can, so I do have some loyalty there, and obviously companies like Marriott hope more and more people do. I typically do not go, I'll go to Kayak, and check air prices, and things like that, but I typically won't use Bookings or Expedia, but I think I'm in the minority there.
Hill: I will never use Trivago, because that guy in the commercials it's just way too annoying.
Gross: I haven't seen that guy lately.
Hill: Maybe word got through. Wayfair's second-quarter profits were much higher than expected. Shares of Wayfair rose more than 8% this morning. You take these together, and it's a little confusing because on the one hand, we've got people leaving their homes, travel demand is up, but you look at Wayfair, and clearly people are buying stuff for their homes as well.
Gross: I mean, a great two-year run helped obviously by the pandemic. Nothing special happened this year at all until today. These numbers clearly beat expectations. The results were not great when compared to pandemic-level numbers, but again, we should know that, we should be expecting that. I don't think Wayfair can be blamed for that. I don't see any material weakness in the business. These numbers look fine, especially when you realize you're comparing it to numbers that were outsized for a particular reason. When you see revenue down about 10%, that's compared to last year's at the same time, that's not a surprise to me. If you look at those revenue numbers, they are above pre-pandemic run rates, but since we're anniversarying the really strong growth from 2020 when everyone was focusing on their homes, the numbers are hard to beat. But they do look nice when you compare them to pre-pandemic levels. U.S. revenue down 15%; the one pocket of strength. International revenue, not as big a piece of the pie here, but it was up 16%. There's a little bit of strength there. Number of active customers reached 31 million, an increase of almost 20% year over year, that's a good indication to me. Repeat customers placed 75% of total orders, that's compared to 67%, again, a positive metric, and finally, net revenue per active customer increased by almost 9%. Some solid metrics that indicate the business is fine. You saw gross margins fall a bit, about 1.5%%. But if you go back two years to pre-pandemic levels, those gross margins are up significantly. Again, I don't think they can be blamed for the situation that we find ourselves in. Adjusted earnings were down 25% again, not surprising to me, not troubling to me. I think the Wayfair story remains intact.
Hill: It seems like every quarter we talk about Wayfair I'm reminded of the fact that they've got these other brands under their umbrella. Maybe at some point, they go the route of like we saw with Tapestry where they just we're more than just Wayfair, and they come up with some convoluted name [laughs] that's an umbrella for all of them. It seems like, no disrespect to Perigold, Joss and Main, Birch Lane, it really seems like wayfair.com is the driver of this business.
Gross: I think for sure that's the case. They do give us some color, especially more so on the call than in the press release, on some of the other brands, and where they sew pockets of strength, and where they're focusing, and where they want to expand to. But I think for the most part, you are completely correct about the business, and you're also correct with respect to their communication about the business. They are not going to spend that much time talking about the things that roll up into the bigger business.
Hill: Ever bought anything off Wayfair?
Gross: I bought it because of the pandemic. I bought two stand-up heaters like the umbrella-looking type of heaters. Before there was a rush on them, and it was impossible to get, so we were able to see some friends outside during the winter months. Interestingly, they've rusted over, and all of the screws have fallen out, and I had 1-800-JUNK come and haul them away, so there you go.
Hill: I guess Wayfair didn't sell covers to protect these devices.
Gross: They have covers. One would have to use the cover one purchases in order to protect against the elements. They sat in my garage, unfortunately.
Hill: User error.
Gross: I should not be blaming Wayfair.

2021-08-16 00:00:00+00:00,eBay Reaches Analyst Target Price,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/ebay-reaches-analyst-target-price-2021-08-16,,,"In recent trading, shares of eBay Inc. (Symbol: EBAY) have crossed above the average analyst 12-month target price of $70.87, changing hands for $74.02/share. When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher — if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.
There are 15 different analyst targets within the Zacks coverage universe contributing to that average for eBay Inc., but the average is just that — a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $63.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $85.00. The standard deviation is $7.199.
But the whole reason to look at the average EBAY price target in the first place is to tap into a ""wisdom of crowds"" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with EBAY crossing above that average target price of $70.87/share, investors in EBAY have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $70.87 just one stop on the way to an even higher target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table?

2021-08-16 00:00:00+00:00,eBay's Q2 Results Highlight Reopening Headwinds,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/ebays-q2-results-highlight-reopening-headwinds-2021-08-16,,,"eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY) reported second-quarter earnings on Wednesday, Aug. 11. The results showed the company is beginning to experience the effect of reopening economies worldwide, which means negative growth numbers for the online retailer.
eBay experienced a surge of customers and revenue at the pandemic onset as consumers looked to avoid brick-and-mortar stores. Reversion to old shopping habits was to be expected, as was the less than stellar earnings report. Let's take a closer look at the quarter's results and see if there are any long-term implications in it.
eBay has both fixed-price and auction listings. Image source: Getty Images.
A mixed quarter
In the second quarter, eBay shed 7 million active buyers from the previous quarter. The figure was down by 2 million from the previous year. Active buyers turn the revenue flywheel at eBay. Their presence attracts sellers to list products. Bringing the two together is how eBay makes money, so a loss in this metric harms its long-term prospects.
The second quarter consisted of major economic reopenings worldwide. Consumers likely wanted to get out of the house and visit places they have not been to in quite some time. It remains to be seen if these shoppers will return to eBay after their pent-up demand for outdoor activities is satiated.
The same trend affected the gross merchandise volume (GMV) on eBay -- in other words, the total dollar amount of sales transacted on eBay. This is crucial because eBay takes a percentage of sales (take rate) as its main revenue source. In Q2 2021, GMV was down 7% compared to the same quarter last year. Again, this was not a surprise given the comparison with surging sales in Q2 2020.
A bright spot in the quarter for eBay was increasing the transaction take rate by over 200 basis points from the same quarter last year. This rate increased from 9.2% in Q2 2020 to 11.3% this year. That allowed eBay to earn more revenue in Q2 2021 than the year-ago quarter, even with lower GMV. Indeed, revenue grew by $331 million while GMV decreased by $1.5 billion.
eBay earned a higher take rate by migrating buyers on its platform to use its payment services and encouraging them to promote their listings. There is room to expand each of these further, which could lift the take rate even higher.
What this could mean for investors
The take rate has increased for four consecutive quarters, and it looks as though there is more room for expansion. The boost gives eBay a permanent increase in earning capacity at the expense of sellers. The move poses the risk of alienating those sellers and sending them to other e-commerce platforms, which is something for eBay investors to keep an eye on.
eBay has averaged an operating profit margin of 23.9% over the last decade. If these increases to the take rate stick without losing many sellers, it could increase those margins further. The stock is up 48% year to date, but it's still trading at a favorable forward price-to-earnings ratio of 18.7. It's not too late for investors who are interested in buying the stock.

This video was recorded on July 30, 2021.
Chris Hill: It's earnings-palooza, nearly 1,000 companies reported earnings this week, and we're going to talk about each and every one of them. All right. Not all of them, but we will have a couple of stocks on our radar. We're going to start with big tech, Amazon had its worst single day of trading in over a year. Shares of Amazon fell more than 7% on Friday after disappointing second-quarter results came with weak guidance for the current quarter. Emily, I should add that despite Wall Street's disappointment, this was the third quarter in a row that Amazon's revenue was north of $100 billion.
Emily Flippen: A part of the reaction we're seeing today is just because misses like this are really unusual for big tech and Amazon in particular. But I think we can all afford to be a little bit more in giving with Amazon here, given the unpredictability of things like shopping online, the rollout of vaccines, for instance, the reopening of the economy. Management was put forward to the really tough challenge of trying to figure out, OK, what's guidance going to be for this quarter, but also quarters into the future. So, despite the fact that revenue came in just a little bit under expectations alongside operating profit, earnings still handedly beat, they were up 50% year over year to earnings up over $15 a share versus the $12.30 that was expected, so there's definitely some strong silver lining for Amazon in this earnings season. I will say, it will be interesting to keep an eye on what happens with Amazon and in particular, it's just its Prime business, its e-commerce shopping through the remainder of 2021. Part of their hesitance to give guidance is simply because we don't know what the landscape is going to look like for things like the spread of the delta variant in the United States, which could materially impact Amazon's future quarters.
Hill: Well, and this is going to be a running theme, particularly with the big tech companies, just the idea that guidance is pretty tepid for the second half of 2021. But Emily, to your point, it's for all the obvious reasons.
Flippen: Amazon does a great job of monetizing the users it does create. Even though it has tough year-over-year comps, more than 50 million of the 200 million Prime subscribers that they currently have were brought in over the prior 18 months. These are people that tend to stick around and spend more year over year, so all good news for Amazon, for long-term investors.
Hill: Shares of Alphabet hit a new high this week after second-quarter profits and revenue came in higher than expected. Jason Moser, what impresses you the most? With Google's ad revenue, the results we saw from YouTube, or the company announcing a $50 billion share buyback plan?
Jason Moser: Honestly, Chris, I think it was all of it put together is the most impressive part. It just goes to show how strong a business it is. Same size market cap as Amazon as we were just talking about there, but twice the profitability, interestingly enough, they obviously have a different business model, but it just goes to show you the money that Google is making. The stock has been on fire this year up better than 50% and it seems clear why these numbers were just terrific, indicative of a business with services in very high demand. When you look at the numbers of consolidated revenue, just under $62 billion, that was up 57% excluding currency effects. Costs of revenues, that is something that the business continues to control very well, they grew only 41%. That was primarily driven by traffic acquisition costs. But when you look at everything together with what Google does, Google Search and other advertising revenues are up 68% for the quarter. It's understandable that it was a big bounce back from last year given the situation. But that really is strong, 68% and strong growth in retail, of course, as everything starts coming back on line and then the economy opens back up. YouTube advertising revenue was $7 billion, that was up 84% driven primarily by brand advertising. They noted the connected TV is the fastest-growing consumer service that they have in the U.S, over 120 million people now watching YouTube on TVs every month. Then Google Cloud, which continues to grow revenue of $4.6 billion for the quarter, that was up 54%. As to the other bets, yeah, still losing a ton of money, but you know the market that holds that against them, Chris.
Hill: How much do you think regulatory risk played into the decision to have the share buyback plan of $50 billion? Because part of me thinks there are a lot of ways they can spend $50 billion. Acquisitions is one of them. But I can see someone in the executive suite arguing, acquisitions are only going to draw more attention. This is a prudent way to spend $50 billion.
Moser: Well, yeah, I think you're right. No. 1, this is a cash cow, they just made cash hand over fist here quarter after quarter. That $50 billion is going to be replenished in short order. But I think you're right. Throwing more acquisitions on top of the mix right now would probably be less than ideal, would probably get them on regulators' radars more than they would care to be. But it doesn't mean we won't see ideas like that down the road. Remember, they are really just now getting the Fitbit acquisition integrated into their business. They have some work to do and some recent acquisitions there, but I think what you said makes a lot of sense.
Hill: Apple's third quarter featured revenue of $81 billion with the services division making up a record $17.5 billion of that. Emily, huge numbers from Apple once again, but CEO Tim Cook did warn that the chip shortage is going to affect sales of the iPhone and the iPad.
Flippen: This was an absolutely incredible quarter for Apple. It does beg the question of, well, we expect some issues with chip shortages in the future, but even this quarter was impacted by chip shortages, there were supply constraints, slow delivery. Can you imagine what this quarter would have looked like if the chip shortage didn't exist right now? Would have been an even more incredible quarter for Apple. As you mentioned, sales were up 36% year over year, with iPhone in particular, up over 50%, and earnings of $1.30 a share was up 92% year over year in terms of net income, so a really great quarter. iPhone, in addition to the services segment, is definitely what you can watch here. There is double-digit growth in iPhone sales and every single market they sold into. They reached an all-time high in terms of installed base. That's critical because that installed base then goes on to funnel into the services that you mentioned. With services revenue up 33%, 20% of sales came from services. Things like Apple TV, the Arcade, Apple Card, Fitness+, all of these things create a really strong and compelling Apple ecosystem that investors have come to know and love.
Hill: I know that Apple prints money, so whatever money they are spending on Apple TV and the production of shows on Apple TV is almost immaterial. That said, Emily, do you think there comes a point where they need to make Apple TV essentially a stand-alone hit on its own, because this is a business that wants profitability in all of its divisions?
Flippen: I don't think they need Apple TV+ to be the best streaming service in order to succeed. But I certainly think they need to do a better job than they're doing right now. That might include things like being more acquisitive. But I think they have been hesitant with that because as we just talked about, regulations for these big tech companies have become under an extreme level of scrutiny recently. So I don't think they're pushing super hard to make Apple TV the newest and best thing in terms of streaming right now, that's a really competitive space. But I also think that it's on their radar that they need to make a better and more concerted effort and compete in terms of production value and popular TV shows, if that's going to continue to drive service revenue growth.
Hill: Microsoft's second-quarter revenue grew 21%, and once again, the cloud business continues to impress. Azure grew 51%. Jason, this is a $2 trillion company. I thought growth was supposed to slow down once you got to be that big.
Moser: Well, don't tell Satya Nadella, because it seems like he still has his foot on the gas, so to speak. Steady stalwart here just turned in exactly the quarter we'd expect from one of the most established companies in the world. Another example of big tech having a good year. So far, the stock is up almost 30% here to date, that looks poised to continue based on these numbers. To your point, they're on the revenue growth, very strong revenue, $46.2 billion, earnings per share of $2.17 that grew 42%, excluding currency effects. Strong performance from the key segments there. Intelligent Cloud, that grew 26% for the quarter. But if you look at the commercial cloud revenue, that itself was up 31% for the quarter and gross margin for that cloud business expanded 4% to 70%, very encouraging to see. To me, I look at Microsoft and its multiple revenue drivers. It's just a good sign of a business that really is set to do well here in the coming years as we become more digital. If you look at the strength of these different business segments the past three years, gaining security, and now, LinkedIn, those three aspects of the business alone have all surpassed $10 billion in annual revenue each. That most recently here with LinkedIn's revenue just passing $10 billion for the first time this fiscal year, that was up 27%.
What's even more impressive with LinkedIn, that growth is accelerating. I just didn't realize that LinkedIn was still so relevant, but that was a really shrewd acquisition five years ago. Revenue there has almost tripled since the acquisition, that growth is still accelerating, which is just really impressive, and you can't forget about Teams, of course, and for all the attention that Zoom gets these days. Microsoft is really capitalizing on this move to hybrid work. Teams closing in on 250 million monthly active users, nearly 80 million monthly active Teams, phone users. We've talked a lot about Zoom Phone, Microsoft has a phone offering, too, so they are doing a lot to leverage that platform. I suspect this is going to be a business that continues to shine here over the next several years.
Hill: Let me go back to LinkedIn for a second because you used a word that, to my recollection, absolutely nobody used at the time of the acquisition, and that is ""shrewd.""
Moser: I know.
Hill: There are a lot of questions about Microsoft buying LinkedIn, even though they had plenty of cash on hand to do so, this is one of those things that looks shrewd in hindsight, but at the time, it was a little bit more of a leap of faith that Nadella and his team knew what they were doing, wasn't it?
Moser: I think you're right, and I think we said as much on a number of our shows here at the time. But I think what it goes to show you, and this is why we harp on this a lot when we talk about competitive advantages, you look at the networks that these businesses have, it just goes to speak to the network and how valuable that network can be. When you have a large network of users as Microsoft does, you can take these acquisitions, these properties, something like LinkedIn, you can make it your own, but you can plug it into this massive network just immediately. You see businesses like Facebook doing the same thing in social networking, really just speaks to the value in that massive network.
Hill: Facebook's second-quarter report proved once again, for anyone who may have forgotten, that Facebook is really good at selling advertising. Revenue came in at $29 billion. Emily, we talked about companies that have pricing power. Facebook is doing this by charging more for ads and businesses appear very willing to pay.
Flippen: Facebook has some of the highest pull-through rates for advertisers, especially here in the United States, which makes it a really compelling place for advertisers to invest their money regardless of things like number of active users, because the users who are active are really active. It leads to a really high average revenue per user, that ARPU, it was over $10 in this most recent quarter, which again, is industry-leading. But they grew revenue 56% year over year to just under $30 billion, really just because of this ad revenue. I will say though that year-over-year increase is largely because of this pandemic bounce back. We saw advertisers being hesitant to spend money around this time last year because of the pandemic, clearly, they're coming back to platforms, Facebook's platforms which include Instagram being one of them. Earnings were also better than expected. What will be really critical to watch though, is not just ad revenue because that's what Zuckerberg would have you believe is legacy Facebook. What will be interesting to watch is how Facebook executes on this long-term growth strategy that they're calling, a focus on the metaverse, which is really just this, we'll call it a fourth place, if Starbucks has the third place. A fourth place where people can spend their time in a digital world where they're doing things like buying subscriptions, buying services, and Facebook hopes to be integrated throughout all aspects of this metaverse, their investment in Oculus obviously being critical in making this a reality.
Hill: For anyone who has read the book or seen the movie Ready Player One, it's easy to imagine what Zuckerberg has in mind here.
Flippen: Easy to imagine in your fantasy future reality, hard for at least someone like me to imagine in my everyday life. I'm not sure if I'm going to be spending the majority of my life in the metaverse over the next five to 10 years. But if Facebook has anything to say about it, they're certainly going to try.
Hill: PayPal's second-quarter report featured profits higher than expected, and total payment volume up 40%. Despite that, Jason, shares of PayPal fell 10% this week. The stock was at an all-time high last week, so the drop in some ways is not all that surprising.
Moser: No, it's not. It's been on a real tear and there are some signs that there might be a couple of headwinds here in the back half of the year, but nothing substantial. I would say if investing is all about the future and we know that it is, I think when you break the PayPal thesis really down to the two words at this point, Chris, it's a super app. That's management's focus, it sure seems like a grand vision with a lot of potential, but that is what they refer to within the call as a super app. Over the next several months they're going to be ramping out this PayPal super app in the U.S. with a number of different products and services that span payments, consumer financial services, commerce, shopping tools. They'll have features like high-yield savings, early access to direct deposit funds, buy now, pay later, improved bill pay functionality. This is a place for consumers to get all of their finances taken care of. It's going be interesting to see how that's received. But the business itself today, as you noted, continues to really work. A total payment volume reaching $311 billion for the quarter, they are operating on a $1.5 trillion run rate, if you can believe that now, annualized, which is just really impressive to think about the money that goes for all their properties. But before more than 400 million active accounts now, revenue for the quarter was $6.24 billion. That was up 17% excluding currency effects. I'm sorry, I said $1.5 trillion, I meant $1.25 trillion run rate there on the total payment volume. But they are calling for 52-55 million net new active accounts to be added in fiscal 2021. We hear about eBay and the dissolution of that relationship there. eBay exited the quarter at just under 4% of PayPal's total volume, and that really should creep down to 2.5% by the end of this year.
I think weaning themselves off of that eBay relationship, there are some headwinds in the near term that's going to impact profitability margins a little bit, but it's all for the greater good. They're not going to have to depend on that relationship anymore and then Venmo continues to get it done. Total payment volume, they are up 58% year over year with 76 million active accounts now.
Hill: Just like PayPal, shares of Shopify hit an all-time high last week, second-quarter profits came in higher than expected. Just like PayPal, shares of Shopify went down this week. Emily, this is valuation, right?
Flippen: It's a bit of valuation. But I do think there is this pandemic confusion that investors haven't quite figured out how to navigate with businesses like Shopify. They're still growing handedly, revenue in the quarter was up 57% to over $1.12 billion. That growth was really driven by subscription solutions, which was up another 70% year over year, so these are on top of already really impressive numbers. But it is a material slowdown from where it was in 2020, simply because people aren't spending as much time online as they were around this time last year. Investors maybe aren't prepared for the slowdown in growth in both revenue and gross merchandise value that will happen with businesses like Shopify, like PayPal, but they should be focused on those two-year growth rate numbers, which is still extremely impressive for both of these businesses.
Hill: Is it safe to assume that Shopify is one of those stocks that is never going to look cheap? [laughs]
Flippen: Shopify, in my opinion, has never looked cheap unless you happened to buy it at $30 a share. But the deeper integrations for merchants will be critical for growth in the future.
Hill: The highlight of McDonald's second-quarter report was the new Crispy Chicken Sandwich, which helped drive profits and revenue higher than expected. Jason, I know people have strong opinions about crispy chicken sandwiches, I know you are one of them. But I think we said on the show that when McDonald's was getting ready to launch this, it didn't need to be the best sandwich out there, it just needed to be good enough. You look at these results, it seems like it is.
Moser: Chris, when you lead with the crispy chicken sandwich, the problem is now that takes my mind off the game here. I mean, I'm thinking about how badly I want a crispy chicken sandwich, but I will try to power through this. I am wondering if we need to change their name to McDonalds.com, because this is a digital company, Chris. It's unbelievable to see the investments they've made in such a short period of time, and the success that they have reaped. Believe this or not, they have the most downloaded QSR app in the United States today. They just launched their new loyalty program the MyMcDonald's Rewards program here in the U.S. They have 22 million active MyMcDonald's users, and over 12 million people enrolled in that new loyalty program already. This is all leading to digital systemwide sales growth across the top six markets. Those digital systemwide sales have now reached almost $8 billion just in the first half of 2021. That's up 70% from a year ago. You can see these investments in digital really paying off, as the economy opens back up, Global comps up 40.5%. Even more encouragingly though, up 6.9% on a two-year basis and given the previous year, that's a good sign there. But earnings per share, $2.37, are very respectable there.
Management did note on the call regarding inflation that they're seeing very muted inflation impacts right now, they're not leaping automatically toward this more inflationary environment next year. But they are prepared if it happens because over the past year, they've been able to pass along about 6% increases in pricing over the past year between food and labor costs. It feels like they're in a very good place here for the coming year.
Hill: Shares of Starbucks went down a bit this week, despite the fact that third quarter profits came in higher than expected, same-store sales were 10% higher than two years ago. Emily, you look at where the stock is, I'm not surprised it's down a little bit, but there really was a lot to like in this quarter.
Flippen: Well, I'll tell you what, Chris, you ruined my lede, which is going to be that same-store sales are up 73% year over year. What's the market doing? But to your point, it's only a 10% increase over the two-year basis because of what a weird year 2020 was for Starbucks. To your point, despite beating both in terms of revenue and earnings in a pretty substantial manner, I think there's still some pessimism about input costs into Starbucks business as Jason was just talking about McDonald's and some of the trends that play into the cost and pricing structure for mature industries like this, those same things apply for Starbucks and labor costs will be critical to watch with Starbucks. We've seen a lot of push back about the potential for increase in labor costs for a lot of these businesses and Starbucks is very labor-intensive despite their digital sales. The big question here moving forward is the prices of their summer drinks, iced drinks tend to be higher than the hot ones. Over the next quarter will be really interesting to see if they can sell more of these pricier summer drinks to make up for the input costs and the potential for rising inflation.
Hill: I'm not surprised given the weather here in the United States, given the season, I'm not surprised that cold beverages made up the majority of beverages sold. I am a little surprised that it was basically 75%. This is coming from someone who obviously is only a hot coffee drinker. I have never had any of their cold beverages. But as a shareholder, I appreciate the people who are buying them.
Flippen: Well, that's where you've gone wrong, Chris. Did you try the iced coffee? The iced coffee is a summer favorite, but not just in the U.S. I will say a lot of demand does come internationally, especially for iced drinks. China is one of them and the guidance for China, they pulled back significantly over this quarter because of this uncertainty around COVID. It's not just you who is not drinking enough iced drinks, it's a worldwide phenomenon out here.
Hill: Qualcomm's third-quarter revenue was 63% higher than a year ago, and shares of the tech giant rose a little bit this week. Jason, we've talked about a lot of companies that are struggling with the chip shortage. Qualcomm does not appear to be one of them.
Moser: No, they don't. I think that while it is probably a snoozer for a lot of folks out there, I think the Qualcomm remains a great way to get steady income exposure to the chip space from a market leader with plenty of catalysts on the horizon. In regard to one of those catalysts, Chris, a little fun fact here, the term 5G was mentioned 34 times this quarter'searnings call For a guy like me that focuses on 5G, that was pretty cool to see, particularly as I've recommended the stock. But the numbers were very strong to your point there, revenue of $8 billion up 63%, so strong performance in the chip business there is $6.5 billion revenue with operating profit of $1.8 billion. But it's the licensing side of the business that really impacts that bottom line. Revenue of $1.5 billion resulted in operating profit of $1.05 billion. But strength across all main drivers with business handset revenue up 57%. Radio frequency revenue up 114%, automotive up 83%, Internet of Things up 83% as well. In regard to the chip shortage, that is something going into the call, that was probably the big question for me. Management did offer some clarity there. They find themselves in a great position. They believe the supply will improvement materially by the end of the year. Part of that is because of multisourcing initiatives that they've undertaken. Then second for them, they continue to see and build out more on the capacity side. Again, just a really strong steady business, particularly in a time of some volatility with the chip space.
Hill: Just since it sounds like you went through the Qualcomm conference call through the transcript, did the phrase ""crispy chicken sandwich"" appear at all or was it just 5G?
Moser: I don't know how I'm going to make it through the rest of this show if you keep saying that. But again, I'm going to try to power through for the dozens of listeners.
Hill: Shares of Twilio are falling more than 7% this week after the cloud computing company's second-quarter report. Twilio is in growth mode, so they're losing money. But you tell me, Emily, they seem to be moving in the right direction, particularly when you look at how they are growing the international business.
Flippen: We definitely saw a good quarter from Twilio this quarter, but I will say unlike some of the businesses that we've talked about to this point, I think the expectations for Twilio to have a good quarter were already there as a communications platform provider. Their services don't go away just because the pandemic slows down. In fact, digital channels are even more important now than they ever were before. That's given Twilio the opportunity to expand from just things like communication to actually software and data on things like customer services and integration. They're guiding for really strong revenue growth this year, 50-52%. But that's a material slowdown from where they were right now. This most recent quarter, their revenue of $670 million with 67% year-over-year growth. But they nearly doubled the loss experienced at the same time last year, so it'll be interesting to watch how they attempt to move that bottom line as they grow. For the time being, I think the market is giving them some forgiveness, sacrificing the bottom line in exchange for the top-line growth. But it will be critical to watch.
Hill: This is about a $65 billion company. When you look out over the next 5-10 years, what is a reasonable expectation for Twilio's growth?
Flippen: It's going to entirely depend, as you mentioned, on two things. That's international expansion for which their acquisitions have given them a lot of opportunity for, as well as their dollar-based net retention rates. They had a dollar-based net retention rate of 135% in the most recent quarter, which is industry-leading. In terms of how much market opportunity they can really get, it's going to entirely depend on how many more customers to integrate, especially those outside of the United States, and how well they are able to monetize them.
Hill: Teladoc Health's second-quarter loss was bigger than expected. But the telemedicine company raised guidance for the full fiscal year and shares of Teladoc were basically flat for the week. Jason, you and I were talking about this before the show. The immediate reaction from the market to this report was negative, the stock fell more than 10% and then it steadily climbed back up to finish the week basically flat. Do you read anything into that?
Moser: Perhaps there is some uncertainty there in regard to management's whole person virtual care strategy. That's one thing I come back to here because this is about building out a comprehensive suite of offerings and services geared toward serving all of the patient's needs. This isn't just visiting your doctor via a video chat app on your phone. Now, to be sure, that's a very big investment they're making in the whole person virtual care. But the signs are at least that it's working, and so maybe the market is coming around to that and in realizing that it is. When you look at the numbers, that to me is clear as day. Visits up 28% year over year, organic revenue was up 41% year over year, growth in Livongo members, that was up 45%. They grow revenue per member per month, that was up 142% from a year ago. But remember, we were incorporating Livongo now, so sequentially, it was up 10.2%, still very encouraging. Utilization continues to grow, meaning that people are actually using the platform even after we get back to reopening. They're not seeing telemedicine as just a solution for pandemic times, so to speak. They're seeing their primary 360 primary care offering. That pipeline is filling up, they raised guidance, inked a deal with the fifth-largest health insurer in the U.S. They just have a lot of reasons, I think, to be optimistic with what they're doing, they're going to ramp up some investments here in the back half of the year and that's going to continue to be the story. But to your point there on the profitability side, I will say, well, they may have had a loss that was greater than Wall Street's expectations, their results were all well within the guidance that they set. I think that's important for investors to remember, this is a management team that keeps on hitting the targets that they set for themselves. That to me, is more important than the arbitrary short-term Wall Street targets that are set seemingly in a black box sometimes.
Hill: Shares of Pinterest fell nearly 20% on Friday. There were some positive signs and Pinterest's second-quarter report, but monthly active users were 5% lower than a year ago and the company did not offer guidance on MAUs for the current quarter. That appeared to be one of the main drivers, if not the main driver, of sending the stock down, Emily. Is it just that bad? Is there that much pessimism on their users because the rest of the report looks pretty good?
Flippen: Let me tell you why this was an amazing quarter for Pinterest for which people are focusing on entirely the wrong thing for this business. The fear with Pinterest as an investment, and the thesis, I should say, for Pinterest as an investment has always been, can they monetize their huge user base at a rate that's even a fraction of that monetization that other big social media companies, Facebook being one of them, can achieve? In this quarter, the unequivocally answered that question, and it is a solid yes. The average revenue per user was $1.32 per user. That's critical because that was up 27% quarter over quarter or 89% year over year. The ARPU for the U.S. more than doubled to $5 a user, which is really amazing, and comparable to that up again, even Facebook. They haven't even begun to get into the monetization of their international users. At $0.36 per user, that may sound really low, but that also doubled year over year. This thesis for Pinterest was never, ""Oh man, can they raise their over 400 million monthly active users to 500 million?"" That was never the problem that Pinterest sought out to seek. The issue has always been, can they monetize those users effectively? In this quarter, we saw big advertisers flood back into the Pinterest platform which was the concern last quarter. So it's funny to see the market getting so caught up with a tiny miss in terms of users and only domestic users, by the way, miss these expectations. Domestic users, when in reality they execute it strongly on every other aspect this quarter.
Hill: Shares went down around 20%, sounds like you think this is a buying opportunity.
Flippen: I certainly do. If I wasn't talking about it on today's podcast and have all these trading restrictions, I would certainly be interested in expanding my already existing position. I will say, Pinterest does have challenges ahead of it. The big focus is always going to be on mobile users in particular, because those are the ones they are able to monetize better and whether or not they can actually appeal to that shopping integration with Shopify to get people to make purchases on their platform. I, by no means, mean to present this as the single best buy. There's no doubt that Pinterest will succeed, but I do mean to say that if Pinterest doesn't succeed, it's not going to be because they didn't have enough users. It's going to be because they didn't monetize those users accurately, and this monetization from this quarter is very strong.
Hill: Hasbro's second-quarter profits came in solidly higher than expected, TV production is up, demand for board games is up, and shares of Hasbro are up 10% this week, Jason.
Moser: Who doesn't like toys, right, Chris? It does feel like though interest -- Hasbro's really changed over the years. It's not just Mr. Potato Head anymore, it is a digital physical combination toy company there. That's really working out for them because it feels like the Wizards of the Coast and the digital gaming segment was the real story for the quarter, but even more so it was a strong performance all the way around. There are signs also that this is a business that is going to be able to cope with a potentially more than transitory inflationary environment. I will get to that in a second. But in regard to the numbers themselves, revenue up 54%, small tailwind from currency effects, but really, again, strong performance across all major lines. Consumer products revenue up 33%, the Wizards of the Coast and digital gaming segment revenue more than doubled, entertainment segment, you were just talking about that there, that revenue was up 47%. Encouragingly, while the cost of sales increased in dollars on higher revenue, it actually declined as a percentage of revenue favoring that mix of the Wizard side of the business there.
So, you can see those investments in digital continue to pay off. And to that point on inflation, management did note on the call that in regards to margins, freight and input costs are significantly higher this year than last. Ocean freight costs are projected to be more than four times higher than this year versus last year. That's something that has led the business to pass through some price increases, they are going to be passing through some price increases here during the third quarter, that should be fully realized by the all-important holiday fourth quarter, where demand is highest. Given that, it certainly is understandable the market's enthusiasm this week on the call. All things considered, yeah, Hasbro feels like it's putting itself in a very good place here for the back half of the year.
Hill: Let's get to the stocks on our radar. Our man behind the glass, Rick Engdahl, is going to hit you with a question. Emily Flippen, you're up first, what are you looking at this week?
Flippen: I'm looking at Beyond Meat. The ticker is BYND. I'm keeping it on my radar because they are expected to report earnings next week on Aug. 5th, and I'm really excited to see what they say. They managed to grow sales nearly 40% in 2020, despite having its restaurant and food service business essentially turned off and they were able to get more retail customers. That's impressive given the fact that Beyond Meat has a really high repurchase rate for retail customers of over 55%. I'm excited to see what their results look like with their food service channel, somewhat turned back on in the next quarter.
Hill: Rick, question about Beyond Meat?
Rick Engdahl: Yeah. I've tried to grill Beyond Meat but I have not been successful. I have ordered them in restaurants and found them delicious. I'm mixed on Beyond Meat. What I have not had the opportunity to try yet is anything in the realm of lab-grown meat, and I'm wondering what that competition looks like. If it takes off and it's indistinguishable from meat, then does Beyond jump into their market, what's going on?
Flippen: This is actually my biggest concern with Beyond Meat, because their CEO and founder Ethan Brown, is not interested in getting into lab-grown meat, at least hasn't expressed that interest. If that does take off, it can certainly threaten Beyond Meat.
Hill: Jason Moser, what are you looking at?
Moser: Keeping an eye on Etsy this coming week, the ticker is ETSY. Earnings come out on Aug. 4th and this really is a business we talked a lot about performing well during these stay-at-home economies. This is a business you expect to perform well beyond all those pandemic stuff. I think you pay attention to sellers and buyers and the network because this really is ultimately, at the end of the day, a network business. You see the language in their calls now, I'm going to be interested to see the language in the call regarding all of these additional properties. Because remember, they have reverb now they have Depop and they just acquired ELO7. They are bringing a number of different e-commerce brands under that Etsy umbrella, which I think could be a very wise strategy at the end of the day. Because when you're talking about big-time players where e-commerce is getting done, Etsy is absolutely one of the companies at the top of the list.
Hill: Rick, question about Etsy?
Engdahl: When I going to Amazon, they know everything about my deepest desires of what I want to buy right now. Not so Etsy, when I go to Etsy, they have really no clue who I am and what I want. Do they have some room for growth there in that area?
Moser: They do. I think you'll see more of that as repeat purchases occur and also the investments and investment in Etsy ads and Etsy payments, I think will give them clues as to shoppers' behavior as well.
Hill: What do you want to add to your watch list, Rick?
Engdahl: Once again, just like last week, I own both of these already, so I'm a little happier with Etsy at the moment.
Flippen: There we go. Fair enough.
Hill: Emily Flippen and Jason Moser, we're out of time. Thanks for being here.
Moser: Thank you.
Flippen: Thanks, Chris.
Hill: Thanks everyone for listening. We will see you next week.

2021-08-16 00:00:00+00:00,Amazon's Stock To Rise As Growth Continues,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/amazons-stock-to-rise-as-growth-continues-2021-08-16,,,"[Updated 08/12/2021] Amazon Update
Amazon’s stock (NASDAQ:AMZN) has gained 3% YTD, and at its current price of $3306 per share, it has a fair value of $4257 – Trefis’ estimate for Amazon’s valuation. Amazon is expected to continue growth as the shift toward online commerce continues and digitalization across organizations gain pace. In recently released Q2 2021 results, Amazon posted revenue of $113.1 billion, up 27% y-o-y while earnings increased to $15.12 per diluted share compared to $10.30 per diluted share, in the same period of the previous year. The company continues to make strides in live streaming as it also signed a deal with Ligue 1 in France to stream 300+ soccer matches per season.  
We expect Amazon‘s revenues to grow by 27% to $488 billion for 2021. Further, its net income is likely to rise to $29.5 billion, increasing its 2021 EPS figure to $63.46. For 2022, we expect the revenues to grow further to $568 billion, increasing its net income to $37.6 billion and EPS to $73.73, which coupled with the P/E multiple of 57.7x will lead to Amazon’s valuation of $3306, a 29% upside compared to the current market price.
[Updated 05/28/2021] Amazon’s Stock To Continue Rallying?
Having grown by 75% since the end of 2019, Amazon’s stock (NASDAQ:AMZN) still has growth potential in the near term. AMZN’s stock grew from $1848 at the end of 2019 to $3230 now, compared to the S&P 500 which has gained 69% since the end of 2019. The company benefited hugely from the coronavirus pandemic as consumer preference shifted toward online commerce from traditional. They posted revenue of $386 billion in 2020, up by 38% while earnings where recorded at $42.64 per share compared to $23.46 per share in the previous year. This momentum continued in Q1 2021 as the company beat consensus estimates by posting revenue of $108.5 billion, up 44% y-o-y and earnings were recorded at $16.09 per share compared to $5.09 in the same period of the previous year. The revenue growth was spearheaded by the International segment which recorded a 60% y-o-y growth for the quarter. 
We believe the shift toward online commerce will continue over the world and with the advent of digitalization across organizations, Amazon Web services is expected to continue growing at a high pace. 
  We expect Amazon‘s revenues to grow by 27% to $488 billion for 2021. Further, its net income is likely to rise to $32.5 billion, increasing its 2021 EPS figure to $63.46, which coupled with the P/E multiple of 67x will lead to Amazon’s valuation of $4241, a 30% upside compared to the current market price.
[Updated 01/11/2021] Amazon Update
Having grown by 72% since the end of 2019, Amazon’s stock (NASDAQ:AMZN) still has growth potential in the near term. AMZN’s stock grew from $1848 at the end of 2019 to $3183 now. The company has seen a high revenue growth over recent years, and its P/E multiple has fallen compared to 2017. We believe the stock, after the recent rally, has a good upside in the near term. 
During the Covid-19 crisis, Amazon saw its revenue rise by 35% in the first 3 quarters of 2020 as consumers preferred online shopping to reduce the risk of infection. In Q3 2020, Amazon beat consensus estimates for revenue recorded at $96 billion, up 37% y-o-y and earnings recorded at $12.63 compared to $4.31 in the same period of the previous year. Further, the company reported $146 billion of cash inflows from operating activities for the first nine months.
We expect Amazon’s revenues to grow by 31% to $369 billion for 2020. Further, its net income is likely to rise to $19.5 billion, increasing its EPS figure to $38.21 in 2020. Thereafter, revenues are expected to grow further to $435.3 billion in 2021. In addition, the EPS figure will likely improve to $60.52, which coupled with the P/E multiple of around 62x will lead to Amazon’s valuation around $3758, about 18% upside compared to the current market price.
[Updated 07/10/2020] Amazon Stock Is At An All-Time High, But Will It Grow Any More?
After a near-70% rise since the market bottom on March 23 this year, we believe Amazon’s stock (NASDAQ:AMZN) doesn’t have any room to grow at its all-time high current price of around $3,200 per share. While the company is likely to continue to report strong revenue growth over the foreseeable future, and the increasing contribution of its high-margin Amazon Web Services (AWS) business should also have a positive impact on the profit margin, we think the current P/E multiple figure of nearly 140x is already too high – making further gains to the stock price very unlikely.
AMZN’s stock has increased from around $1,900 to $3,200 from March 23, 2020 – better than the S&P 500, which increased by around 41% over this period. The stock price has been on a run as Amazon benefited from millions of people in the U.S. and abroad turning to online marketplaces to fulfill their essential requirements like groceries, food, toiletries, and medicines. In these uncertain times where companies are cutting pays and jobs, Amazon has raised pay and hired more than 100K warehouse and delivery workers – and is planning to bring in more as it struggles to fulfill the huge, unexpected rise in demand. At the end of April 2020, the company had a workforce of 935K employees. In Q1 2020, the company recorded a 26% growth in revenue compared to the previous year.
  Some of the stock price rise in the 2016-2019 period is justified by the fact that revenues more than doubled. Amazon’s revenues increased from $136 billion in 2016 to $281 billion in 2019, mainly driven by the contribution of Retail revenue from the North America segment. An improvement in net income margin from 1.7% in 2016 to 4.1% in 2019 helped net income swell 137% over the period.
The stock price increased during this period as margins and revenue grew, despite the P/E multiple normalizing from 150x in 2016 to 79x in 2019. The multiple has shot up again this year, though, as people are turning towards online retail and web services during the coronavirus pandemic, and the figure currently stands at an elevated level of around 140x.
Effect of Coronavirus
The global spread of coronavirus has led to lockdown in various cities across the globe, which has affected industrial and economic activity. This is likely to affect consumption and consumer spending adversely. Notably, Amazon’s stock is up by about 58% since January 31, after the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a global health emergency in light of the spread of coronavirus. However, during the same period, the S&P 500 index saw a decline of about 2%. Despite the coronavirus pandemic, the company saw a 26% growth in Total revenues for Q1 2020. Amazon web services led the revenue growth recorded at 33% y-o-y, while the North America retail revenue recorded a 29% growth y-o-y. That said, lower consumer spending and consumption over the coming months could likely lead to lower demand for discretionary items as consumers will focus on essentials.
The actual recovery and its timing hinge on the broader containment of the coronavirus spread. Our dashboard Trends In U.S. Covid-19 Cases provides an overview of how the pandemic has been spreading in the U.S. and contrasts with trends in Brazil and Russia. With investors focusing their attention on 2021 results, the valuations become important in finding value.

2021-08-15 00:00:00+00:00,eBay Earnings: 5 Numbers You Should Know,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/ebay-earnings%3A-5-numbers-you-should-know-2021-08-15,,,"eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY) isn't growing like it was in the early days of the pandemic. The online marketplace just posted some of its weakest sales metrics since 2019 as the stampede toward e-commerce slows. Its pool of active buyers shrank, and eBay handled lower volume than it did a year ago.
Still, its second-quarter results contained mostly good news for shareholders, including booming cash flow and encouraging growth in new business lines like advertising and payments processing. Let's look at a few of the standout numbers from eBay's second quarter.
Image source: Getty Images.
1. Buyer pool: 159 million
One of eBay's core growth metrics, its pool of active buyers, shrank 2% year over year to mark a sharp turnaround compared to the previous quarter. That figure was not only solidly positive through the past year but had accelerated in each of the last four quarters (rising from 1% in early 2020 to 8% at the start of 2021). The slump was reflected in falling gross merchandise volume (GMV), which fell 11% compared to a better-than-20% rise in each of the last four quarters.
2. Revenue: Up 11%
Management wasn't surprised by the GMV pullback, and growth in the core business is still impressive compared to 2019. Meanwhile, eBay is getting a big boost from its advertising and digital payments offerings, which helped overall revenue rise 11% despite declining volume.
Executives had predicted between 8% and 10% growth on that metric back in May. ""On an apples-to-apples basis,"" CEO Jamie Iannone said in a press release, ""all key business metrics met or exceeded expectations.""
3. Transaction fees: 11.3%
eBay's financial metrics were noisy due to the portfolio transformation project that's produced several major divestments since 2019. Strip out those temporary impacts, and the news is all good. eBay's operating expenses fell as a percentage of revenue, free cash flow improved to 34% of revenue, and its transaction income -- the fees it charges sellers to use the platform -- rose to 11.3% of the top line compared to roughly 9% before the pandemic struck.
4. Cash returns: $1.6 billion
Management took advantage of the gushing cash flow and extra funds from the sale of its classifieds business. Stock-buyback spending jumped to $1.5 billion, up from less than $40 million in the prior-year period. Executives say they intend to deliver ""meaningful returns"" to shareholders from buybacks and dividends, and these latest figures back up that promise. ""We are simplifying our portfolio,"" Iannone said, ""and growing our core while delivering significant shareholder value.""
5. The Q3 outlook: 6% to 8% organic growth
eBay called for another growth slowdown as organic revenue growth decelerates to between 6% and 8% in the third quarter (down from 11% this past quarter and 38% at the start of the year). Investors should be happy with that outlook, since it implies a soft landing from the volume spike in 2020.
There are many reasons to expect higher annual earnings from here too. Three of the biggest reasons include eBay's new business lines, its double-digit transaction fees, and its aggressive share repurchase activity. These factors should amplify shareholders' returns from holding this growth stock over the long term.
