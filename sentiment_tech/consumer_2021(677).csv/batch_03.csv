2021-11-13 00:00:00+00:00,Is Tanger Taking This Trend Too Far?,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/is-tanger-taking-this-trend-too-far-2021-11-13,,,"Tanger Factory Outlet Centers (NYSE: SKT) is starting to see business improve, along with its mall real estate investment trust (REIT) peers. That's very good news for investors, noting that it just announced a dividend increase, putting it on the dividend growth path again. But there's another business trend here that investors need to monitor, and it's subtle. Here's what you need to know.
What exactly is Tanger?
The big saying in real estate is location, location, location, which is a very important thing. But part of the location equation is really property type. Think about putting an office complex in a small town that really needs more housing stock. In this situation, the office might sit half vacant even if it offers low lease rates. However, had an apartment complex been built, it would have been a better fit and likely seen high occupancy and strong rents. That's obviously a hypothetical example, but there are real-world implications here.
Image source: Getty Images.
For example, Tanger's only property type is outlet centers. It gets compared to the mall real estate investment trust peer group since it largely contains the outlet version of stores you might find in an enclosed mall. There are material benefits to the outlet focus. For example, the properties are largely outdoor structures and require far less maintenance than an indoor mall would. In addition, the spaces are uniform in nature, so putting in a new tenant is fairly easy and cost effective. When built, outlet centers are often outside of main metropolitan areas, so property and construction costs are lower than what would be spent to build closer to a main population center. And construction costs are lower because of the outdoor nature of the properties and the uniformity of the space.
This often leaves outlet centers as one of the lowest-cost options for retailers to sell their wares. It gives Tanger, and outlets in general, an advantage when it comes to occupancy since it could be easier for a retailer to turn a profit in an outlet center than it would be in a higher-cost enclosed mall. So, Tanger is kind of like a mall but not really. Which is where things start to get a little hazy given some recent moves by the REIT.
Changing things up
There's no question that Tanger has to change and adjust with the world around it. If it didn't, it wouldn't survive -- no company would. So it makes sense that management has been experimenting with different types of retailers. For example, it has brought in discount stores like Marshalls or Saks Fifth Avenue OFF 5TH. These stores basically compete with the typical store you'd find in an outlet center because they sell discounted products from major retailers. The big difference being that there are multiple brands housed in one location in a sort of scavenger hunt model. Tanger had to make sure that stores like these didn't cannibalize its retail tenants looking to sell directly to customers via a branded store. In they end they didn't and they made a good addition to the lessee list.
Management has also brought in Dollar Tree, a highly successful company experimenting in its own way with price points. At its core, though, Dollar Tree is a discount store of a different type that wouldn't compete with Tanger's regular tenants. However, it branches in a different direction, perhaps pulling down the quality of the overall shopping offering. Put a different way, Tanger is now offering dollar store fare at a mall that will also be selling things like high-end Coach bags. Malls are sensitive ecosystems and this particular move could backfire over the long term if it degrades the shopping experience even if it improves occupancy numbers.
In Tanger's second-quarter 2021 earnings conference call, meanwhile, CEO Stephen Yalof talked about including retailers like Dick's Sporting Goods and, more to the point, Nantucket Meat & Fish. Dick's is a name that draws traffic, but it's something you might find anchoring a power center. And Nantucket Meat & Fish is basically a grocery store. Yes, grocery stores help drive regular traffic to a property, but it is entirely outside the nature of what has traditionally been inside an outlet center. To be fair, enclosed malls are making similar experiments, but the building structure is vastly different that leads to a unique shopping experience almost regardless of the tenants. Basically, an enclosed mall will always be an enclosed mall until it is torn down.
However, there is already a large REIT segment dedicated to outdoor structures that contain a mix of grocery stores/anchor tenants and other retailers, like restaurants (another type of business increasingly finding its way in Tanger properties). They are called strip malls. Although Tanger has hardly turned into a strip mall REIT at this point, directionally the experiments it is making are potentially heading it down that path. And that would be a very different business than what Tanger is positioned as today. Investors need to keep this in the back of their minds as they watch the REIT shift and change over time.
No need to worry, yet
Tanger's comparison group still remains the enclosed mall sector. That's likely to be the case for some time to come, and it may never change. However, investors need to be aware that it is adding retail concepts that are far outside of the factory outlet space. And, if this trend goes far enough, it might be less mall REIT and more strip mall REIT. That's a change that would materially alter the equation for investors and needs to be monitored.

2021-11-03 00:00:00+00:00,Get Paid Every Month With This Stock,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/get-paid-every-month-with-this-stock-2021-11-03,,,"Real estate is a classic wealth-building tool; getting that monthly rent check is a sweet feeling. Thanks to real estate investment trusts (REITs), you don't have to actually buy buildings to get that feeling. Realty Income (NYSE: O) holds a collection of retail properties and shares the rent money through monthly dividends. It also has proven it can take a punch.
REITs operate differently from a typical business. It's essential to understand how REITs work and what makes Realty Income such a robust dividend stock. Here is what you need to know.
How does the business work?
REITs are a particular type of business structure that Congress created in 1960 to hold income-producing real estate. They give investors the ability to participate in the benefits of owning real estate without having to own property themselves.
Image source: Getty Images.
A REIT receives special tax treatment and doesn't have to pay corporate income tax, as long as it meets the following condition: It must pass at least 90% of its taxable income to shareholders in the form of dividends.
Realty Income is a REIT that focuses on stores and quick-service businesses; its top tenants include 7-Eleven, Walgreens Boots Alliance, Dollar General, FedEx, Sainsbury's, and Dollar Tree.
These are generally steady businesses, and not very sensitive to economic ups and downs, producing reliable rent for Realty Income. During the spring of 2020, at the height of lockdowns that created unusually adverse operating conditions for businesses, Realty Income still collected 83% of the rent it was contractually owed in its worst month.
Its tenants enter into a triple-net lease. That means while Realty Income collects rent from its tenants, the tenants are responsible for the property's upkeep, including insurance, property taxes, and maintenance; this removes most of the variable expenses from Realty Income's books and leaves just the financing of the actual properties.
Dividends pay like clockwork
Steady and dependable streams of rental income make for an outstanding dividend stock. Most dividend companies pay a quarterly dividend, but Realty Income pays every month, making it a great stock if you're trying to live off the dividends.
The company went public in 1994 and has paid and raised its dividend each year since, a streak going on 28 years. At the stock's current price, the dividend yield is 4%, far more than any savings account will offer these days. A solid yield that increases each year? What's not to like?

While REITs pay out 90% of their taxable income as dividends, factors like depreciation affecting net income make it difficult to illustrate to investors how the business is performing. Instead, REITs detail adjusted funds from operations (AFFO), which is essentially the cash flow that the REIT produces. Investors can refer to AFFO to get an accurate sense of a REIT's operating performance, as well as how well it can afford its dividend.
Management is forecasting 2021 AFFO per share of $3.53 to $3.59, while the company's annual dividend is $2.83 per share. This means that the dividend payout ratio, the percentage of Realty Income's AFFO that is spent on the dividend, is 79%.
When we consider how resilient Realty Income's rental income is, this is a comfortable payout ratio. The company raised its dividend through both the pandemic and the financial crisis in 2008-2009; it seems safe to say that the payout is battle-tested.
The ""secret sauce"" of Realty Income
Since going public, Realty Income has outperformed the S&P 500 ; but how does it do it? Realty Income has a very high-quality management team, and the business enjoys some advantages that its peers may not be able to match.
^SPXTR data by YCharts
To illustrate this, we need to look at how a REIT grows. Realty Income expands by acquiring new properties. Remember that most of the company's income goes to the dividend, so to fund expansion, REITs will raise capital by taking out loans, issuing debt or selling new shares -- or a combination of all three.
To make a profit, this means bringing in a higher return on assets (rent from tenants) than the cost of funding, expressed as the weighted average cost of capital, or WACC.
Realty Income's WACC is 5.3% over the long term, the combination of its rates on debt, and how much it raises when issuing shares. The company has a strong balance sheet; it's one of seven U.S. REITs with an ""A-"" credit rating or better.
The company can rent to high-quality tenants who pay lower rents, but still make money because of its low WACC. REITs with higher WACCs have to rent to riskier tenants, charging them higher rents to make a profit.
This competitive advantage shows in Realty Income's ability to increase its AFFO. The company's AFFO has increased at a historical median of 5.1% each year, compared to the average growth rate of 3.2% for its peers.
The higher growth and quality of tenants mean the stock trades at a premium valuation, enabling the business to continue raising low-cost capital when it issues new shares. It's a cycle that has powered the company's returns for years.
After raising its dividend for more than a quarter-century, I don't see why it can't continue to do more of the same.

When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher — if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.
There are 14 different analyst targets within the Zacks coverage universe contributing to that average for Dollar Tree Inc, but the average is just that — a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $90.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $131.00. The standard deviation is $13.842.
But the whole reason to look at the average DLTR price target in the first place is to tap into a ""wisdom of crowds"" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with DLTR crossing above that average target price of $107.28/share, investors in DLTR have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $107.28 just one stop on the way to an even higher target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table?

2021-10-31 00:00:00+00:00,Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR) Has More To Do To Multiply In Value Going Forward,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/dollar-tree-nasdaq%3Adltr-has-more-to-do-to-multiply-in-value-going-forward-2021-10-31,,,"If you're not sure where to start when looking for the next multi-bagger, there are a few key trends you should keep an eye out for. Typically, we'll want to notice a trend of growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and alongside that, an expanding base of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. In light of that, when we looked at Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR) and its ROCE trend, we weren't exactly thrilled.
Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What is it?
For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. To calculate this metric for Dollar Tree, this is the formula:
Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)
0.13 = US$2.2b ÷ (US$20b - US$3.7b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to July 2021).
So, Dollar Tree has an ROCE of 13%. That's a pretty standard return and it's in line with the industry average of 13%.
NasdaqGS:DLTR Return on Capital Employed October 31st 2021
In the above chart we have measured Dollar Tree's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Dollar Tree here for free.
What The Trend Of ROCE Can Tell Us
Over the past five years, Dollar Tree's ROCE and capital employed have both remained mostly flat. Businesses with these traits tend to be mature and steady operations because they're past the growth phase. So unless we see a substantial change at Dollar Tree in terms of ROCE and additional investments being made, we wouldn't hold our breath on it being a multi-bagger.
The Bottom Line
We can conclude that in regards to Dollar Tree's returns on capital employed and the trends, there isn't much change to report on. Since the stock has gained an impressive 46% over the last five years, investors must think there's better things to come. Ultimately, if the underlying trends persist, we wouldn't hold our breath on it being a multi-bagger going forward.
Like most companies, Dollar Tree does come with some risks, and we've found 1 warning sign that you should be aware of.

2021-10-27 00:00:00+00:00,7 Top Stocks to Buy On Any Dip If You Get the Chance in Q4,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/7-top-stocks-to-buy-on-any-dip-if-you-get-the-chance-in-q4-2021-10-27,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Identifying stocks to buy on the dip will always be a winning strategy for long-term investors. So you should always keep some companies on the radar to get long when stock prices become more attractive. Therefore, today’s article discusses seven stocks to buy on the dip in the winter months.
JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) strategist Marko Kolanovic recently suggested that the Covid-19 pandemic was at an “effective end” and that investors should buy the dip in sensitive cyclical stocks positioned to benefit from overall economic growth.
However, others are cautioning volatile days might be ahead. For instance, in early December, Wall Street will witness political debate and posturing on whether the nation’s debt ceiling will be increased of if default might be on the horizon.
Meanwhile, amidst surging inflation, the Fed is getting increasingly hawkish. Tapering should start in the weeks ahead followed by potential interest rate hikes. Equities might come under pressure when we get the first interest-rate hike in recent years. Finally, soaring energy prices and the current concern over the collapse of Chinese real estate developer China Evergrande Group (OTCMKTS:EGRNY) constitute additional risks.

Yet, potential declines in equity prices would also mean more opportunity to buy solid stocks at cheaper valuation levels. With that information, here are seven promising stocks to buy on the dip that would make great additions to any portfolio:

International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM)
Jazz Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:JAZZ)

Vale (NYSE:VALE)

52-week range: $84.26 — $120.37
Chesapeake, Virginia-based Dollar Tree operates discount stores in the U.S. and Canada. Its business segments include Dollar Tree and Family Dollar. The retail chain usually offers branded and private-label goods with $1 price tags.
Dollar Tree released its Q2 results in late August. Consolidated net revenue increased only 1% year-over-year (YOY) to $6.34 billion. Net income came in at $282.4 million, or $1.23 per diluted share, up from $261.5 million, or $1.10 per diluted share, in the prior-year period. Cash and equivalents ended the quarter at $767.7 million.
On the results, CEO Michael Witynski said, “Our EPS of $1.23 represented increases of 12% from the prior year’s quarter and 62% compared to the second quarter of 2019.”
Due to disruptions in the supply chain and surging inflation, Dollar Tree recently announced that it would begin selling some items for as much as $1.50. The news led to an immediate double-digit rally in DLTR stock. The retailer plans to open 500 new Dollar Tree Plus stores by the end of the fiscal year.
Dollar Tree bought back $950 million of its stock so far in fiscal 2021. Despite surging about 20% in the past month, DLTR stock is still down 5% year-to-date (YTD). The shares are trading at 16x forward earnings and less than 1x sales. Interested readers could regard a short-term decline toward $100 as a better entry point.
International Business Machines (IBM)

52-week range: $105.92 — $152.84
Dividend Yield: 5.11%
Tech giant International Business Machines issued Q3 results on October 20. After adjusting figures to compensate for the upcoming spinoff of its Kyndryl infrastructure business, IBM’s total revenue went up by 2.5%. Net income came in at $1.13 billion, or $1.25 per diluted share, down from $1.7 billion, or $1.89 per diluted share, in the prior-year quarter. The company generated adjusted free cash flow of $11.1 billion.
“With the separation of Kyndryl early next month, IBM takes the next step in our evolution as a platform-centric hybrid cloud and AI company,” CEO Arvind Krishna remarked in a press release. “We continue to make progress in our software and consulting businesses, which represent our higher growth opportunities.”
Management has been working hard to transition the Big Blue toward a hybrid-cloud and artificial intelligence (AI) group. IBM recently announced a partnership with Apptio that aims to “help clients improve hybrid cloud technology decision-making and drive adoption of Red Hat OpenShift and IBM’s open hybrid cloud approach.”

IBM stock plunged over 10% in the few days after its Q3 results, which came up short of market expectations. It currently trades at slightly above $125, up just 1.5% YTD. With a dividend payment yielding over 5%, IBM might also appeal to income investors. Shares are trading at 10.7x forward earnings and 1.5x trailing sales.
Jazz Pharmaceuticals (JAZZ)

52-week range: $126.01 — $189.00
Dublin, Ireland-based Jazz Pharmaceuticals focuses primarily on treatments for sleeping disorders, hematology and oncology. The biopharma group announced Q2 2021 results in early August.
Revenue surged 34% YOY to $752 million. Non-GAAP adjusted net income came in at $241 million, or $3.90 per diluted share, compared to $207 million, or $3.71 per diluted share, in the previous year. Cash and equivalents ended the quarter at $891 million.
Management has been putting resources on further enhancing its pipeline, as around 40% of the revenue comes from recently launched or acquired products. Analyst believe that the cannabinoid epilepsy drug Epidiolex and the recently approved acute lymphoblastic leukemia drug Rylaze could provide further tailwinds for sales growth.
Following the quarterly announcement, CEO Bruce Cozadd remarked, “We have now executed four of five planned product launches since the beginning of 2020 and look forward to our anticipated launch of Xywav in idiopathic hypersomnia later this year, a critical step forward for these underserved patients.”
JAZZ shares hover at $145 territory, 23% below their multi-year high of $189 hit in June. They are also down 12% YTD.  The stock trades at 8.2x forward earnings and 3.2x current sales, a relatively cheap valuation compared to its peers in the biopharma space.
Omega Healthcare Investors (OHI)

52-week range: $28.08 — $39.31
Dividend yield: 8.77%
Hunt Valley, Maryland-based Omega Healthcare is a healthcare facility real estate investment trust (REIT) focused on nursing home facilities. This REIT holds close to 1,000 properties across the U.S. and U.K.
Omega Healthcare announced Q2 results in early August. Total revenue was flat YOY at $257 million. Net income came in at $87 million or 36 cents per common share, down from $102 million a year ago. Adjusted funds from operations (FFO) was $207 million, or 85 cents per common share, compared to $190 million, or 81 cents per common share, for the prior-year quarter. Cash and equivalents ended the quarter at $101 million.
CEO Taylor Pickett remarked, “The second quarter was a positive one for the Company, with strong second quarter Adjusted FFO and FAD, as well as, continued solid rent collections.”
OHI has maintained a dividend rate at 67 cents per share for the past eight quarters, despite occupancy problems and financial problems of its operating partners. It currently offers a lucrative 8.8% dividend yield.

The stock hovers at $30 territory, more than 20% down from its 52-week high of $39.31 from late April. It’s also down 16% YTD. OHI shares are trading at 7.7x trailing sales.
Paysafe (PSFE)

52-week range: $6.90 — $15.65
London, U.K.-based Paysafe is a payments platform that operates in various vertical markets, including payment processing, digital wallets, iGaming, and eCash.
PFSE issued Q2 results in mid-August. Revenue went up by 13% YOY to $384 million. Net income came in at $6.6 million, or 4 cents loss per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $15.9 million, or 13 cents loss per diluted share, in the prior-year quarter. In addition, the company generated free cash flow of $54.6 million. Cash and equivalents ended the period at $1.5 billion.
CEO Philip McHugh remarked, “We are pleased with the continued momentum Paysafe exhibited over the second quarter with impressive growth and several key wins across iGaming and other attractive digital commerce verticals, including crypto.”
iGaming separates Paysafe from its peers in the digital payment space, as the platform’s digital wallets can be used for online gambling. Paysafe recently said that it will expand its partnership with FOX Bet, offering digital wallet and electronic cash products for the sports betting platform. The company also announced acquisitions of PagoEfectivo and SafetyPay, leading open banking solutions in Latin America.
PSFE stock hovers around $8 territory, trading almost half its 52-week high of $15.65 in late March. It is down 46% YTD. Shares trade around 40x forward earnings and 4x sales.
Vale (VALE)

52-week range: $10.38 — $23.18
Dividend Yield: 9.58%
Rio De Janeiro, Brazil-based Vale is the world’s largest producer of iron ore and vital raw materials for steelmaking. The bulk materials division, mainly iron ore and iron ore pellets, accounts for most of its earnings, but Vale is also the world’s second largest nickel producer.
Vale released Q2 results in late July. Net operating revenue jumped 122% YOY to $16.7 billion. Net income skyrocketed to $7.6 billion, or $1.49 per diluted share, up from $995 million, or 19 cents per diluted share, in the prior-year quarter. Free cash flow for the period stood at $6.5 billion. Cash and equivalents ended the quarter at $13.7 billion.
On the metrics, CEO Eduardo Bartolomeo cited, “As we proceed with the resumption of our iron ore capacity, we also eliminated six upstream dams and advanced consistently on our ESG agenda.”
Iron ore prices have recently declined as China lifted trade barriers for the steel industry. As a result, VALE stock has come under pressure. However, analysts expect the demand for iron ore to keep going up in the long run. The transition to electric vehicles (EVs) is another significant tailwind, lifting the demand for iron ore as well as other commodities such as nickel.

VALE shares hover slightly above $13, trading 40% lower than the 52-week high in June. They are down 19% YTD. The stock also supports a generous dividend yield of 9.6%. VALE shares look like a bargain, trading at just 3.8x forward earnings and 1.3x sales.
Zynga (ZNGA)

52-week range: $7.14 — $12.32
San Francisco, California-based Zynga is a mobile video game developer that generates revenue via mobile game downloads, advertising services, and in-game sales of virtual goods. Zynga announced Q2 results in early August.
Revenue increased 59% YOY to $720 million. Net income came in at $28 million, or 2 cents per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $150 million, or 16 cents loss per diluted share, in the prior-year period. Cash and equivalents ended the quarter at $1.5 billion.
CEO Frank Gibeau cited, “We delivered strong Q2 results ahead of guidance, including our best-ever Q2 revenue of $720 million, up 59% year-over-year, and record Q2 bookings of $712 million, an increase of 37% year-over-year.”
The global mobile gaming market is expected to increase at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 11.5% over 2020-2027. Zynga recently purchased Chartboost, a leading advertising platform with 700 million monthly users. It also announced the acquisition of StarLark, a mobile game developer from China. These acquisitions should significantly contribute to Zynga’s top-line growth in the near term.
ZNGA stock hit a 52-week low of $7.14 in October. It currently hovers around $7.5, down 25% YTD. ZNGA stock trades at 27x forward earnings and 3.3x sales. Interested readers could find value around these levels.

2021-10-26 00:00:00+00:00,Scared of Inflation? 2 Top Value Stocks to Buy Now,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/scared-of-inflation-2-top-value-stocks-to-buy-now-2021-10-26,,,"With the Fed projecting U.S. inflation to exceed 4% in 2021, now is a great time to take a closer look at value stocks. These companies' valuations tend to be less dependent on low interest rates or discounted future cash flows. And their better-than-average dividend payments can help offset the declines in the dollar's value.
Philip Morris International (NYSE: PM) and Dollar General (NYSE: DG) are two companies whose stock could make excellent investments in this uncertain environment.
Image source: Getty Images.
1. Philip Morris International
Philip Morris International (PMI) is a tobacco giant focusing on markets outside of North America, which helps lessen the impact of regulatory risk and economic headwinds in any particular country. Its dirt-cheap valuation, healthcare investments, and pivot to reduced-risk products make it a potentially excellent choice for investors.
PMI's second-quarter net revenue jumped 9.1% year over year to $8.1 billion, powered by heated tobacco unit (HTU) sales, which made up 13% of shipment volume (69.6 billion units). Smoke free-products (which include HTUs, vaporizers, and oral tobacco) now represent roughly 29% of PMI's revenue. And the company is well on its way to achieving its ambition of having 50% of its revenue come from smoke-free products by 2025.
PMI's reduced-risk transformation is key to both its customers' health and its bottom line. Analysts at Broyhill Asset Management expect operating margin (currently 45%) to increase by 100 to 200 basis points annually as IQOS, its flagship reduced-risk product, gains market share. The $1.4 billion acquisition of pharmaceutical inhalant maker Vectura could also help PMI develop more industry-leading reduced-risk tobacco products by giving it access to more patents.
With a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 14, PMI is valued higher than its U.S. counterpart, Altria, which trades for just 10 times forward sales. But with PMI's margin-boosting transition to reduced-risk products and geographic diversification, the premium is well deserved. The stock's current dividend yield of 5% on a $1.25 per-share payout is icing on the cake.

2. Dollar General
With its focus on low-priced consumer staples, Dollar General is well-positioned in this inflationary environment. The company's expansion into healthcare could boost its economic moat and make investors smile all the way to the bank.
Inflation is a double-edged sword. The good news is that higher prices spur shoppers to switch to discount retailers like Dollar General, but higher production costs will make it harder for them to maintain low prices. However, unlike rivals such as Dollar Tree, Dollar General won't pass the higher costs to consumers. Instead, management said the company plans to keep prices low by changing its product mix -- a strategy that could set its stores apart in thrifty consumers' minds.
Dollar General is also leveraging its proximity to underserved communities to expand into synergistic opportunities. Management has said it wants select stores to become a healthcare destination by offering telemedicine and prescription services in rural zip codes. Dollar General is at the beginning stage of this pivot, but according to CEO Todd Vasos, the transition could be a ""really big deal"" for the company's top and bottom lines.
Management is guiding for EPS of up to $10.20 for full-year 2021, which would represent a 24% annual growth rate. The guidance gives the company a forward P/E multiple of 22, which is significantly lower than the S&P 500's average P/E of 30. Dollar General returns value to investors through a share buyback program expected to total $2.4 billion this year. The company's dividend of $0.42 per share per quarter yields only 0.76%, which seems low, but that's mostly because the stock price has appreciated 225% in the past five years.
Betting on value
With their rock-bottom valuations and inflation-resistant business models, Philip Morris International and Dollar General look positioned for success. Both companies are also exploring synergistic opportunities for expansion, which could help power their next leg of long-term growth.

2021-10-16 00:00:00+00:00,Retailers Chartering Their Own Supply Ships May Not Stop Shortages This Christmas,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/retailers-chartering-their-own-supply-ships-may-not-stop-shortages-this-christmas-2021-10,,,"When even the White House no longer sugarcoats the supply chain crisis and warns ""there will be things that people can't get"" for Christmas, you know the situation is going from bad to worse.
The congestion and bottlenecks at the busiest ports are so severe that some of the biggest retailers are chartering their own ships to bring in their merchandise from overseas, despite pricing for charters being at record levels.
Image source: Getty Images.
Most of the retailers are reserving ships for relatively short periods, seemingly just trying to get through the Christmas season, but Dollar Tree (NASDAQ: DLTR) seems to think the problem may be much worse, as it has entered into shipping contracts until 2024.
Although some analysts say that move unnecessarily ties the discounter to high-cost charters well beyond when the situation should have eased, president and CEO Mike Witynski told analysts it believes its regular carriers will be able to fulfill only 60% to 65% of their commitments.
So is the deep discounter onto something, and are the others due to find themselves in the same situation in the future? Or is this a transitory issue that will sort itself out in due course? There's good reason to believe the dollar-store chain may be right.
Image source: Getty Images.
Trying an end run around the bottlenecks
The Port of Los Angeles is the world's largest port, some 43 miles long and 8,000 acres in size. Last year it moved more than 9.3 million twenty-foot equivalent units, that being roughly the size of a typical intermodal container. About half a million containers are currently waiting to be offloaded from cargo ships at the port.
Flareups of coronavirus in Asia have disrupted the supply chain as new lockdowns are imposed, but retailers can't wait. From Costco (NASDAQ: COST) and Home Depot (NYSE: HD) to Party City (NYSE: PRTY) and Walmart (NYSE: WMT), major retailers are attempting to ensure distribution centers and stores are fully stocked with merchandise for the holiday season by contracting for their own container ships. IKEA is even buying its own containers.
Where the typical container ship can hold around 20,000 containers, the ships the retailers are getting are much smaller, carrying only around 1,000 containers, though they are usually about twice as expensive to charter.
According to industry site Freightos, the global container freight index rose from $2,232 last year to almost $10,000 this year while the index for the China/East Asia route to North America's west coast went from $3,847 in 2020 to over $16,000 today. While prices have eased in recent days, rates remain extraordinarily inflated.

A monster truck jam
Yet shipping is only part of the problem. For the containers to be offloaded, a conga line of trucks must be ready to take the goods from port to locations across the country. Some 73% of all goods are transported by truck, but the nation is also caught in the grip of a truck driver shortage that threatens the nation's supply chain as well.
This is a separate crisis that has been building for years. The American Trucking Association warned in 2018 there was a shortage of 51,000 drivers, and that shortage only worsened after the pandemic struck. The ATA now predicts the industry will need 174,000 truck drivers by 2026.
Trucking giant Old Dominion Freight Line (NASDAQ: ODFL) recently held a job fair where it said it was willing to hire new long-haul drivers, regardless of whether they had experience or not. Trucking companies offering hiring bonuses of as much as $20,000 are not uncommon.
The ripple effect will continue hurting supply chains across the country and across all industries. Retailers are hoping that by chartering their own ships they'll be able to bypass the congested ports and offload their goods at less busy ones, but they still might encounter logjams because of the driver shortage and end up creating backlogs elsewhere.
The New York Times says 80,000 containers are now waiting to be moved out of the Port of Savannah in Georgia, some 50% more than usual. It calculates that about 13% of ""the world's cargo shipping capacity is tied up by delays.""
No easy way out
Analysts are optimistic the traffic jam at the ports can be cleared up by late 2022 or early 2023, but the deepening trucking crisis could very well extend the logjam even further.
It may be costing Dollar Tree more to lock in these high rates for what seems like such a long time, but the discount chain may be the most prudent retailer to lock in today's charter rate. Consumers, though, may be the ones most disappointed after they see just how barren store shelves become.

*Stock Advisor returns as of September 17, 2021
This video was recorded on Sept. 29, 2021.
Chris Hill: It's Wednesday, September 29th. Welcome to MarketFoolery. I'm Chris Hill. With me today, Asit Sharma in the house. Good to see you.
Asit Sharma: Good to see you, Chris. Glad to be here.
Chris Hill: We've got software earnings, we've got another new public company, but we're going to start with the stock of the day. Shares of Dollar Tree (NASDAQ: DLTR) up to 14 percent this morning after the discount retailer increased its share buyback plan from $1.5 billion to $2.5 billion. The company also said they are going to start selling more products at a higher price point due to, let's just call it the usual suspects. Supply chain issues, labor costs, that sort of thing. What do you think of that? It seems like good timing on the company's part because even with the pop today, the stock is still down for the year.
Asit Sharma: Chris you know my initial reaction was, it's not that huge deal. But let's take it in context of the piece of data that you mentioned alongside which is that they are going to be adding new price points above one dollar across their Dollar Tree plus format stores and they're going to keep experimenting in their legacy stores with price points above one dollar. Now let's seems like a very minute shift that a company can make but if you look at Dollar Tree versus its prime competitor, Dollar General, its stock has under-performed miserably over the last five years. Both companies have fairly vigorous, comparable sales growth. Mid to high single-digit in any given quarter, which is pretty good for a dollar store outfit and both have gross margins that fluctuate in the 30, 32, 33 percent range. What's the difference between these two concepts? Well Dollar General has always had a pretty wide price point in their stores. You can buy items for a dollar or you can buy items for $10. Dollar Tree in opposition to this business strategy has clung if I can hit a very awkward sounding past tense here, has clung to a one dollar price point for a very long time.
Now, it acquired Family Dollar several years ago to branch out because Family Dollar primarily offers a wide range of price points. Why is this price-point business so important? It's because all of these stores operate on a very big retail footprint strategy. They're constantly opening up stores in rural areas, expanding to whitespace across the United States. When that's your business model, you want to squeeze every dollar you can out of every selling square foot you can. The problem with Dollar Tree historically is that it's lagged behind the sheer oomph that Dollar General brings because of that price point. If you look at its productivity per square foot, it averages around 100 bucks per square foot in sales. Dollar General averages 30-40 percent above that in any given year which means that Dollar General is squeezing so much more Abbott's operations, enjoying better cash flow, enjoying better operating income. I think the one-two punch is very appealing to shareholders. They want to see that Dollar Tree can compete on a multiple price point basis and lift that square foot selling percentage, and they like frankly, the fact that there's cash on the balance sheet. This is a company that is now back to an investment-grade rating. It's paid down some of the debt that it had on its books. I think they've got reasons to be pleased and maybe this is a reason to not count Dollar Tree out and not call it a perennial also ran, which I have been guilty of [laughs] doing here over the last several years.
Chris Hill: You're not the only one who is called them that and you reminded me of the conversation I had with Jim Gillies last week where the topic of share buybacks came up with something that some companies don't do a great job of in terms of timing they're buying when their stock is really high. In the case of Dollar Tree, this seems like a pretty advantageous way to use the cash on the balance sheet that they have. You're right, if they don't need to radically overhaul their pricing strategy. They don't need to across-the-board, start hiking up prices. They can be very judicious in how they do it and if they're smart about it then a year from now, their numbers start to look a lot better.
Asit Sharma: I think so. Your point is very well taken on the share price. This is a company whose stock has only increased by 25 percent over the last five years. That's a grand five percent a year in share price improvement versus Dollar General, which has increased by 210 percent over the same time period. Both of these are before their dividends. Price return only not total return. There is an argument to be made here that with the slightly new business strategy, the shares are undervalued relative to their potential, relative to a benchmark competitors. They are doing the opposite of what many companies do, which is, as you say, to buy shares when they are too high, and waste capital. This looks on the face of things pretty efficient.
Chris Hill: Warby Parker is going public today. The online eyeglasses retailer is doing a direct listing with a starting price of $40 a share, which gives Warby Parker and initial valuation of close to $5 billion. I'm not going to take any issue with how they're pricing their stock. Not when we've seen what we've seen over the last 18 months in terms of whether it's IPOs, direct listing, SPACS, whatever. Is this a business that interest you as a shareholder? Or potential shareholder?
Asit Sharma: It actually is, Chris. The older I get the more I realize I've been tripped up by not paying attention to strong brands in the marketplace. I think that Warby Parker has an extremely well known brand among consumers. They set out 10 or 11 years ago to reinvent the iWear selling industry. At that time, there were very few companies that were selling online. This company started from scratch, built its own supply chain, controls its own distribution, has a very reasonable price point. I would start to 95 bucks for a pair of very nice glasses. Glasses looks spiffy. I have to say you can't ignore this potential shareholder. Look at the products out in the real world. They've got a very attractive portfolio of eyewear. As I say, it's reasonably priced. It's a direct-to-consumer model. Not only do they sell online, but they have now a very big retail footprint. I think this is a company that potential shareholders may want to pay attention to. Their founder led, the co-founders are still going to own a big chunk of the company and a controlling interest in the company so they can call their own shots. The financials look interesting too. Warby Parker isn't profitable yet, but on an operating basis, they're trending toward breakeven. Chris, when you stack their numbers from 2018-2020, you see a lot of growth. In 2018 the company had revenue of about $273 million. In 2020, they had revenue of about $394 million. Now, they stumbled last year when everything shutdown in the retail world. But looking at their numbers this morning, the first six months of 2021, they show a really fast rate of growth versus that softer period in 2020. They've done about $271 million in revenue in the first six months of this year. You can extrapolate that out to a pretty decent year that's going to be above $500 million in revenue, and as I said, they are trending toward breakeven. With that revenue for the first six months, they've only lost about $7 million on a net income basis. There are lots of things to like about this company. I wanted to ask you generally, are you familiar with this brand? Is it just me who has seen this out in the real-world and things while it's about time they went public?
Chris Hill: I am familiar with the brand. I've owned Warby Parker glasses in the past, and I think they've done a pretty smart job with their physical retail strategy. There are a couple nearby. There's one in Georgia founders, one that went in share in Old Town Alexandria on the main strip, King Street. I think there have been smart about slowly methodically expanding their physical footprint. I also think they have a pretty compelling story in terms of an industry that doesn't really get a lot of attention. I'm not saying it should, but there is essentially a monopoly in the eyeglasses industry or there has been for a very long time, which is why the price of eyeglasses is so expensive. It's why Warby Parker is able to come in with a product that is a quality product at a much lower price. I'm rooting for them just as a consumer and someone who wears eyeglasses. I don't know that I'm going to rush out and buy their stock. I always like to see how companies do those first couple of quarters, both in terms of their results. Are they delivering in the way that they say they're going to deliver? Because it's so much harder to be a public company than a private company, and what is management style? How are they dealing with the questions they get on a conference call? Those are all things I want to see. But a decent opportunity for them, certainly.
Asit Sharma: Yeah, I agree. I like that you mentioned that they are one of the scrappy underdogs in the eyewear world which is, I think dominated by just a few big conglomerates. Luxottica comes to mind.
Chris Hill: Luxottica, yeah. That's the big one.
Asit Sharma: The Italian conglomerate that has given so many small players trouble. They do have a virtual monopoly in this business. Through M&A, they've only gotten bigger in the past few years. It is fun to see an underdog with a great product. I'll ask you in maybe two or three years from now, Chris, that they say in their perspectives that they've got a pretty good success rate with customers coming back. They've got a 50 percent sales retention within the first couple of years of selling a pair of glasses and a nearly 100 percent sales retention within 48 months, which means that Chris Hill might try another pair after his Warby Parker purchase, but within about four years, he's going to come back and buy another pair from them. We need to check-in in a few years on that.
Chris Hill: The one thing that just made me laugh was I went into their store, this is before their store in Old Town existed. I was in Georgetown. I was wearing my Warby Parker glasses. There was just a little problem with the frame and I thought, I feel like I need a little bit of an adjustment, so I go in there. Staff was very helpful. The only thing that made me chuckle was the staff person showed me to a comfortable seating area where I could hang out while she was going to adjust my glasses. Right before she went back to work on my glasses, the last thing she said to me was, ''By all means, if you want to relax here and read one of our magazines, please do.'' I thought, ""Yeah, no, I can't do that because I'm not wearing my glasses. I appreciate the offer, but it's a misguided offer because I'm not wearing my glasses."" But aside from that, great customer service.
Asit Sharma: They aimed to please.
Chris Hill: [laughs] Exactly. Let's move on to Endava (NYSE: DAVA). Shares of Endava are up this week after ending their fiscal year on a strong note. Fourth-quarter revenue for the British software development company grew in the neighborhood of 50 percent which as revenue growth goes, is a pretty nice neighborhood. This is what you and I were talking about earlier. I'd never heard of this company before. How did Endava come across your radar and what did you think of the results?
Asit Sharma: Yes. There's this big and wide wave of digital transformation going on in every industry. We all know that. But this digital transformation is split up between software that's being offered by umpteen companies and software-consulting services which are offered by only a few. There are the big giants like Accenture, and then there's a series of smaller companies. Globant is one, EPAM Systems, E-P-A-M, is another, and Endava is a third that I follow. These companies are really interesting because there is a need within larger corporations for companies to come in and help improve internal software and software DevOps, provide the glue between different systems, but also to help with customer-facing technology. These smaller companies like Endava, which has a market cap of just $7 billion, help with that. I feel like this is a big playing field if you wanted to construct a basket around this. I like the idea of Accenture. It's this huge mammoth consulting company which can provide a solid base and then you can add the other three companies I mentioned and play this digital transformation wave on the consulting side. I like Endava, because again, it's so small and growing quickly. One of the things I look at in this industry is how a company is growing its headcount. The headcount at June 30th of 2021, which has got these numbers yesterday, is almost around 9,000 employees. You can compare that to about 6,600 employees at the end of the previous fiscal year. You can see that Endava is really hiring people and acquiring smaller consulting companies to be able to meet capacity out there in the marketplace. It's a sign that they see a lot of demand ahead. This hit my radar screens simply because it's just often bewildering to try to sort through the different software-as-a-service companies that offer so many solutions as companies tried to get more proficient in remote work, more proficient in fintech options, more proficient in customer communications. I could go on and on and on. It's almost easier to spend a little bit of time on this space between these four companies I've mentioned. That's how it hit my radar screen. These are the big picture things I like about it. Just to mention a risk which is actually shared by the other two smaller players that I mentioned, EPAM Systems and Globant. The top 10 clients for Endava account for about 36 percent of revenue.
That's decreasing a bit versus 40 percent last year. But each of these small companies basically has the strategy to go very deep into a few large customers and then pull in new customers and gradually expand out of those concentrations. The other thing that I wanted to mention about this company is that it's got a really great revenue diversity. It's got about 31 percent of revenue in North America, 42 percent in the UK where they're based, and 24 percent in Europe. It's a company that's pretty well spread out across major centers. They need to get a little more representation in Latin America, which is becoming a hotspot for digital transformation. I think they could expand their footprint in Asia. But there's a lot to like in this little story. As you mentioned, Chris, the biggest thing is the eye-popping growth that the company has been able to generate. It's still quite small. Last thing I'll say before we discuss this a little bit, it does have a high-valuation. With that 50 percent range growth comes a 56 times earnings forward multiple, which I think is not too difficult to stomach when you consider that the playing field, the market, is very wide for companies like Endava. There is going to be work for years in the industries that it focuses on. For this company, that's pretty much payments in fintech, financial services, technology, media, and telecom. That's where they focused. They could stay in those industries and do well for quite a number of years to come.
Chris Hill: Two questions. First, I want to make sure I heard the numbers correctly. You said in terms of their top 10 clients, that represents 36 percent of their revenue, do I have that right?
Asit Sharma: Yeah, come back, Chris. Chris, come back. [laughs]
Chris Hill: No. That doesn't seem like a huge risk to me. When you preface it by saying, I think this is a risk, I assumed you were going to say their top 10 clients represent some number north of 50 percent. I thought it was going to be one of those concentrations. But the fact that it's 36 percent down from 40, to the extent that that's a risk, that seems like it's a risk that's getting smaller.
Asit Sharma: I think you've put a reasonable frame on it. Part of this is you get so used to the trees when you're in the forest. For those of you out there who invest in software-as-a-service companies, you're used to seeing zero concentration because a company is selling to thousands and thousands of customers. When you flip over to a consulting business and see a concentration like that, it's scary. But Chris, as you point out, this is actually reasonable. It means that they could still hold a couple 3, 5 of those very important clients and not take it too much on the chin that can probably rebound with the rate of customers they're adding anyway each year in a short amount of time. Yes, thank you for putting a more reasonable layer on that and not running clearway from the company after I said that.
Chris Hill: Second question. As you mentioned, the market cap is around somewhere between 6.5, $7 billion. Given their growth, given the market they operate in, how confident are you that Endava is a stand-alone public company in three years? Because it seems like the type of business that a larger fish could come along and make a big offer to.
Asit Sharma: This is a really good question. I always think about Accenture, which has a market cap of $206 billion and an enormous balance sheet. The three companies that I've mentioned are all quite small, although Globant and EPAM Systems are slightly larger. But it wouldn't be difficult for a company like Accenture to come in with a stock and cash deal and acquire any one of these. Why hasn't it yet? It could be just lack of strategic fit and the fact that Accenture itself is already so entrenched with some of the same customers. They don't see the need to get distracted with the smaller acquisition. Now, could there be mergers between the three companies I've been talking about? Potentially in the future, we could see one or two of these outfits merge. But because each of the companies that I'm talking about, again, to give you the name is one more time, EPAM Systems, Globant, and Endava, because they're all founder-led companies where the initial founders still hold some type of appreciable stake, most would be with this company Endava, but to some degree with the other two. I think that the founders are very focused on doing their own thing and pursuing their own vision. I'm going to give you a 65-70 percent confidence interval that they'll still be public in a few years.
Chris Hill: Asit Sharma, great talking to you as always. Thanks for being here.
Asit Sharma: It's a lot of fun. Thanks so much, Chris.
Chris Hill: As always, people on the program may have interest in the stocks they talk about on The Motley Fool may have formal recommendations for or against.

*Stock Advisor returns as of September 17, 2021
This video was recorded on Oct. 1, 2021.
Chris Hill: It's the Motley Fool Money radio show. I'm Chris Hill. Joining me this week, senior analysts Andy Cross and Ron Gross. Good to see you as always, gentlemen.
Andy Cross: Hey, Chris.
Ron Gross: How you doing, Chris?
Hill: We've got the latest headlines from Wall Street, we'll dig into the rise of sports betting and stock trading with CNBC's Melissa Lee, and as always, we've got a couple of stocks on our radar. But we begin with a rough month for the market. The S&P 500 fell nearly five percent in September, the worst month of the year, so far. Andy, all three major indices are still up double-digits for 2021, but I don't blame any investor who's just a little bit rattled after the past few weeks.
Cross: Chris, it was a hard month for investors, especially growth investors. We've had such a really nice rebound off the COVID lows from last year. This year, like you mentioned before, the stocks were up, the market was up more than 20 percent. Now, it's at that mid double-digits, like that 15 percent range. We're back to where we were in July. It's still not horrible. Overall, we still have seen pretty [...] , not much volatility into the market so much. We still haven't seen those big, really dramatic pullbacks, north of five percent on a daily basis in a long period of time. But certainly, I think this is one reason why we constantly really talk to our members, and to listeners, and to viewers of our shows and talking about, listen the markets have been really calm over the last 18 months, and we don't expect that going forward. We know markets historically fall, 10 percent every year or 13 months or so, as far 15 percent every couple of years, 20 percent every four years. As an equity investor, Chris, you really have to expect that volatility. We haven't seen it. So this past month is not unexpected. There's still a lot of positive takes in business and equities and stocks, but we have seen a pullback in the markets, and we still have markets that historically are at fairly high levels of valuation, especially for the large-cap companies and especially for the technology companies.
Gross: I agree with what Andy said. Listen, the markets can't go up forever. They have to take breathers from time to time, and we have to, as long-term investors, understand that and expect it so when it happens, we don't get too freaked out about it. The market is, as Andy said, somewhat pricey here. If you just want to look at a PE ratio for an example, S&P 500 PE ratio is around 31. Even if you look at a forward PE ratio, it brings it down to 22, more reasonable, but still historically high. That's a relatively high price to earnings multiple. Yes, earnings are a little bit in fluctuation right now, influx as a result of COVID. But still, there's many other measures you can look at to see that the market is pricey. We have rising interest rates, 10-year note hovering around 1.5 percent. That's higher than certainly, we've seen over previous years. We have inflation concerns that we're seeing actually show up in the earnings results of our companies. It's just not this innocuous, amorphous thing. It actually is impacting profitability. Macroeconomic fluctuations happen from time to time. Don't have money in the market that you need over the next three years. If you follow that guidance, you can take a lot of the pressure off of yourself, a lot of the stress when markets get weak.
Cross: I have a little cash on the sidelines. I think that's important for individual investors. But I will note, when you look at the S&P 500, that's generally a large-cap index that is so much dominated by technology these days. When you look at the small-cap index or even the mid-cap stocks, those are far more reasonable on an index basis. The market overall is, as Ron said, on the pricier side, when you look at that large-cap popular index like the S&P 500, but going to the small-cap index, and some of those small-cap stocks, you might be able to find some more reasonable valuations there that could be more beneficial to the more cyclical plays that come with continuing reopening of the economy that, hopefully, we'll see over the next year or two.
Hill: Let's get to some of thestock newsof the week. Shares of Merck up 10 percent on Friday and hitting a 52-week high after the pharmaceutical giant announced promising results in a late-stage study for its COVID-19 pill. Merck says it plans to file for emergency use authorization as soon as possible. Ron, good day from Merck shareholders and good news for public health.
Gross: Yes, good news for us all, and I like it a lot, exciting COVID news. As you said, Merck and its partner Ridgeback Biotherapeutics, I haven't heard of them before, announced an oral antiviral medicine that they have developed, significantly reduced the risk of hospitalization from COVID-19 by about 50 percent in a Phase 3 study, and zero patients who received the drug in the study passed away. Obviously, positive news there. Recruiting people into this study is being stopped early due to these positive results. As you said, they'll plan to submit an application for emergency use authorization to the FDA as soon as possible. They'll also submit marketing applications to other regulatory bodies worldwide. So this is really great news. Now, we've heard of other antivirals. Gilead's Remdesivir is probably the one that is most talked about in the news. But Pfizer, Novartis, others, have antivirals also under development. There's a lot of great stuff on the horizon, I think, both with vaccines and antivirals. Interestingly, companies, that are focused on vaccines, share is a little weak today on the fact that there is something you can take after the fact if you do get COVID. But still, the combination of vaccine and antivirals is very positive for society. As you said, Merck shares 52-week high, maybe even at near all-time highs or close to it. Not too expensive at 14 times forward earnings with a 3.5 percent dividend yield to low. Not too bad if you want to take a look at Merck.
Hill: Back in July on this show, we told you that the Zoom Video was buying Five9, a Cloud-based call center operator in an all-stock deal worth nearly $15 billion. On Thursday of this week, the deal was rejected by Five9 shareholders. On Friday, Andy, shares of both Zoom Video and Five9 were up on this news. Was this just doomed from the start? Are they better off apart? [laughs]
Cross: Both stocks are up 12 percent or so. Looking out after the deal was announced, so there were some excitement around what this combination of Five9's Cloud-based contact center solutions combined with Zoom's video business. There were some excitement there, even though it wasn't all-stock deal. There were some risk in there with the stock price of Zoom. Clearly, Zoom stock price is down almost 30 percent since the deal was announced. That's pulled Five9 stock price down. There has been some concerns about some of Zoom's connections and business operations in China. The Justice department and the FTC have been investigating that part of their business. Some of the big proxy advisory services like Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis had recommended voting against the deal for Five9 shareholders. I think when you add that all together, but most of the stock price and the fact that Zoom was probably not going to raise the offering price for Five9 at that $15 billion mark, even though Zoom is very profitable, and has lots of cash on their balance sheet. It looked like the deal was just starting to get doomed over the last couple of weeks, and clearly, Five9 stockholders voted against it. Then both companies mutually agreed not to pursue it any longer.
Hill: Shares of Bed Bath & Beyond down nearly 30 percent this week after second quarter results were much lower than expected. The company also cut guidance for the full fiscal year, and CEO Mark Tritton said supply chain problems have been pervasive. Ron, I want to start by offering my condolences since you're a shareholder of Bed Bath & Beyond. [laughs] How bad is this? Tritton is someone who doesn't really pull his punches.
Gross: I know you'll recall that Bed Bath got caught up in that meme-stock madness, stock went to 53, now we're back at 16. I will disclose that I sold most of my shares except for 100 shares when the stock popped as a result of the meme craziness. So I still have a little piece so I can keep an eye on it. Company has been attempting to execute a turnaround under the guidance of Mark Tritton, formerly of Target. I'm a big fan, actually. I think he does great work. He sold non-core assets. He introduced a much heavier lineup of private-label brands to the stores. Now, this quarter, there was a bit of a stumble on the way to the turnaround. Two main issues, demand and supply. I'm no economist, [laughs] but I'm told that one of those would be bad. If you do two at the same time, you get a stock that's down 20 or 30 percent. First, demand got whacked in August due to the Delta variant which caused shopper traffic to slow, especially in big states where they are Florida, Texas, California. Comp sales down one percent, total sales down 26 percent. Then the company, as you said, experienced supply chain issues and cost inflation that hurt margins. They lost 73 million for the quarter. If we allow for some adjustments, they were slightly profitable. Then not surprisingly, the company also lowered its guidance. Stock is interesting to me. At $16, I've got to say is a potential entry point back in. I personally have been to Bed Bath store several times over the last couple of months. The dominance of the private-label merchandise is a negative to me. It's all over the place. That gives me a little bit of pause, but I'm doing a little work here myself.
Hill: Coming up after the break, we've got another new public company, some spicy earnings, and the sexy world of house paint. Stay right here. This is Motley Fool Money.
Welcome back to Motley Fool Money. Chris Hill here with Andy Cross and Ron Gross. McCormick had nice sales growth in the 3rd quarter, but it wasn't good enough. Apparently, shares of the spice maker downed five percent this week and hitting a 52-week low. Ron, am I the only one that looking at this as a chance to buy shares of a solid business like McCormick at a discount?
Gross: It could be a nice entry point here as a result of the fact that shares are up about 15 percent year-to-date this week as you say contributing to that. I feel like I'm stealing Jason's thunder here, but since he's not here this week, I'm going to carry on and talk McCormick. Results for the quarter, they actually weren't too bad. Sales up eight percent, mostly driven by restaurants coming back online. Consumer segment grew too, but only by about one percent, facing tough comps when we were all home pretty much cooking, and all of us not go into restaurants a year ago. The main concern from an investor focus is that the company's comments about cost pressures were a little bit concerning, and they're not alone. Obviously, we are seeing that across the board. Inflation hurt margins, hurt profitability. Adjusted earnings-per-share were still up about five percent, but things could have been much stronger if it wasn't for those pressures. The company intends to raise prices when necessary. I do think they have some ability to do so. There will be a limit to what they can do there, but certainly there's some room, I believe. They guided sales to the high-end of the range. That's interesting, but they lowered the outlook for operating income because of the pressure here on margins. The business from a demand perspective still remains strong, which is great. To your point about the stock, 28 times, not necessarily cheap, but growth could accelerate as restaurants continue to come back online. They've made some solid acquisitions like Cholula, which I use almost every day. That should add to the bottom line. So if that growth accelerates, the 28 times won't seem as expensive, perhaps, as it does, and it has a 1.7 percent yield, which dividend investors will like.
Hill: This week, Warby Parker went public via a direct listing. The online eyeglasses retailer started at $40 a share and closed its first day at $54. Andy, a lot of enthusiasm for Warby Parker right out of the gate.
Cross: I think their direct listing is really interesting, Chris, because to do that direct listing, they weren't raising money for the actual business. They are just basically offering their shares out there from existing shareholders, just basically adding liquidity into that business. But they didn't get any money from this. They weren't raising any capital from it. Now you've got a six-billion-dollar business. Very interesting, founded in 2010 by some Wharton students. Interesting, the name comes from a couple of characters from a Jack Kerouac novel, which has really interesting. It does, Chris, as you mentioned, it's known for its direct-to-consumer online business. But really it's basically half-and-half between online and offline, and they have 145 of these retail outlets. I think that's what's really interesting and also a little concerning when I look forward at the stock, again, at $6 billion a market cap, a stock that is doubled from the private value earlier this year. They do probably about $400 million in sales. They don't have a very large part of a very fragmented market, and they are a very small player in that large market. But they're going to have to continue to build out that store base, Chris. They're going to add 30-35 stores. Now those stores are very profitable. They're not like Apple levels when you look at the sales per square foot, I should say, but still very healthy. They do generate a lot of sales per square foot, but they are still investing a lot back into the business. Not very profitable. They're not as unique as they used to be, maybe a few years ago when they were selling those $95 or 100 pair of glasses online with the try-on apps you can use. Now more and more players are doing that. There's a lot of good, healthy expectations baked into a stock price. I love the fact that they're trying to simplify the eyeglass buying experience. I think all three of us and four of us, when you add Rick in behind the glass, wear glasses. That whole process of buying that is really, I think, subpar. I appreciate that. They've high-growth ambitions, but it's definitely baked into the stock price. I'm pausing on this one, not acting right now, just watching to see how they go along.
Hill: Shares of Dollar Tree up more than 10 percent this week. The discount retailer increased its share buyback plan from $1.5 billion to $2.5 billion and said they're going to start selling some products at a price point higher than one dollar. You tell me, Ron, which of these two things is more responsible for the stock moving up?
Gross: It's both, but I think the dollar initiative is more impactful here. On the heels of their Dollar Tree Plus initiative, which previously introduced higher price sections. In small percentages of their stores, they announced they will begin offering products at price points above one dollar at Dollar Tree Plus stores and that higher prices will allow them to offer different merchandise such as frozen meats, yam, and seasonal items, other products that cost more than a dollar. They said they are on track in 2021 to have 500 Dollar Tree Plus stores by the end of the year, another 1500 are planned for fiscal 22, and at least 5,000 stores are expected by the end of fiscal 2024, so a very large growth initiative for them. I think these higher prices were likely necessary as a result of rising supply chains and labor costs as we're seeing across retail. It puts them more in line with what Dollar General has done from a price point perspective. Dollar General is a much larger company from a market cap perspective than Dollar Tree. Now you said they also boosted their stock buyback program, authorizing an additional $1.05 billion in share repurchases that totals the authorization to 2.5 billion at a market cap of 21 billion. That's 10 percent that they are signaling that they're going to at least attempt or be authorized to repurchase. Now that is a meaningful number and that can be certainly part of the movement in the stock this week. It's both Dollar Tree making some interesting moves.
Hill: On Tuesday, Sherwin-Williams lowered its guidance for 3rd quarter sales. Shares downed a bit as the company cited persistent problems with raw materials and said they don't expect issues in their supply chain to improve in the next few months, Andy.
Cross: Chris, it's the second time this month they've lowered the guidance, so now expecting sales guidance to be flat to down in the 3rd quarter. They've nicked their profit guidance, and that's really impacting the forecast, and that's starting to show in some of the earnings guidance the analyst are putting now on some of the stock price. Again, they just, as Ron mentioned earlier in the show, continue to see these impacts in supply channel as well as raw material costs. With Sherwin-Williams, you're seeing the Hurricane Ida that really hit heavily down in the southern part of the United States, are more severe for suppliers and will actually last longer, so they have those impacts, as well as costs, just continuing to increase across the board. The improvements they expected to see in the key resins which go into their supplies to produce their paints and coatings, the production improvements they were expecting in September, have not come through, and those will be pushed out now. Here you have a stock at about $280 per share, it's a $73 billion market cap, you have a nice little dividend yield in there. Stocks up about 20 percent this year, a little bit ahead of the market. Their price earning is around 30 times, Chris. It's a very steady business. It generates a lot of cashflow they use to buy back stock, pay back their dividend. So when you look at it overall, it's still a pretty good business at a reasonable stock price.
Hill: Guys, we'll see you later in the show. After the break, CNBC host Melissa Lee on the potential and pitfalls for the new generation of stock traders. You're listening to Motley Fool Money.
Welcome back to Motley Fool Money. I'm Chris Hill. In 2020, money that might have gone toward trips to Las Vegas, instead started pouring into sports betting apps. Revenue for the stock trading app Robinhood more than tripled over the previous year. The intersection of online betting, stock trading, and gaming is the focus of a new CNBC documentary; Generation Gamble. It premiers Tuesday, October 5th at 8:00 PM Eastern. It's reported and hosted by Melissa Lee. She joins me now from New York City. Melissa, thanks so much for being here.
Melissa Lee: Thanks for having me, Chris.
Hill: You've done documentaries on cybersecurity, AI, consumer goods. Was the sheer amount of money pouring into these industries the thing that got you interested in this topic, org was it something else?
Lee: That was definitely part of it. Hardly a day goes by on my show, Fast Money, where we don't talk about the rise of sports betting, the increasing popularity of trading on apps like Robinhood and Webull, crypto like Doge. It really gets you thinking. It's not only a growing business, but the other side of it is who are these people who are devoting the hours and the dollars to these businesses, the time involved in placing the bets or making the trades. I really thought this was something that was going on in society that could really change our outlook going forward toward money and the attitude toward taking risk. I think, that's a change that we are in the midst of right now, Chris.
Hill: Let's talk about the sports betting part of this first. I knew or, at least, would've guessed that a lot of money was going into sports betting because I watch sports and I've seen all the commercials. All of the commercials are for DraftKings, and FanDuel, and all these different apps. But the revenue that they are getting in return, which is something you get at in the documentary, whatever they're spending on advertising, it looks like they're doing a good job of getting revenue back.
Lee: When you take a look at the sheer numbers when it comes to sports betting and iGaming because iGaming is also a booming business, just in the first half of this year we've surpassed the total [...] in the total of last year. This is really a growing part of the mindshare of this generation. You go into any sports bar, Chris, or college campus, and everybody is talking about betting. I'm clearly far away from that generation. That's for the demographic. But that is going on, and this is just in the fabric of what this generation does. It's not a big deal to place a bet. For us, we grew up remembering what it was like to have to wait on line to do a transaction, whether it be retailer or whatnot. This generation, they only know transacting on their cellphone, and so the friction to use money, whether it be for trading, or for betting, or for spending in any way, it's zero. They just reach into their pockets and they do it. They don't have to leave their bed. They don't have to leave their dorm. They could be in a class and placing a bet. It's a generational change here.
Hill: Another thing you get at is, as you said, it's so easy to do. We grew up at a time where if you wanted to place a bet, you had to get on a plane and fly to Vegas. You had to go to a casino. There were so much more work involved, and it's so much easier to do now. The incentives that the sports betting platforms and iGaming platforms are throwing out there are ridiculous, but they seem to be working.
Lee: Absolutely. You can just take a look at the numbers in terms of the users and the engagement. Gaming away a sure bet for your first bet place, basically, the odds will be in your favor for sure for that very first bet. It pays off because the lifetime of that new user far surpasses what that company had to spend to get that new user in that first trade. It just gives you a glimpse into how much money, if you can hook that person, so to speak, with their first trade, and it checks all the boxes when it comes to the rush, the adrenalin, the money in your account, you've got them.
Hill: One of the thrill lines in your documentary that connects these industries is the psychology at work here. You talked to young investors who take comfort in knowing that, as they're starting out as investors, they're not alone. They are part of a larger movement on Reddit. But you also get at the flip side of that, which is, you talked to a university professor who's doing one of the first studies on the connection between online trading and gambling behaviors, and it sounds like the early results aren't great.
Lee: I'm glad you brought up the study, because that was absolutely shocking to me. He surveyed 400 retail investors, just random retail investors, 400 of them. He asked them if they held GameStop, AMC or Doge. Fifty-one percent said they held at least one. Can you imagine, if that's just a random sampling of retail traders and more than half owned one of those securities, that just tells you what the psyche is of these new traders. To be sure, they may have other money set aside that is more longer-term. But they are more than willing, Chris, to take a gamble because they can check that out ten times a day and see that stock go up 10 cents, $1, double. I mean, in the case of GameStop or AMC, double or triple over the course of a matter of days. That also gets at that same adrenalin rush. We're talking about all the same physiological triggers that get activated when you're ""winning"", whether it be a sports bet or a trade. That's what really fascinated me in terms of the connection between the two.
Hill: Robinhood declined to sit for an interview for this documentary. I'm curious, from a business standpoint, how bright you think the future is for businesses like Robinhood, and Webull, and other trading apps that gamify investing because it really seems the SEC is taking a long hard look at the way they do business, which is different from how other regulators seem to be looking at the sports betting industry.
Lee: I think that's a really good point. I think that the demand for zero-cost trading is always going to be there. Clearly, people want to trade and I think that not having to pay 999, or 799, or whatever it is, that makes it all that much more likely that your trade is going to pay off. People have just been conditioned to think that trading should be free. Particularly this generation, I think they'll never go back to paying for something. But in terms of, I mean, the core of the business model for Robinhood, in particular, is payment for order flow. They receive payment for order flow for sending those retail orders to market-makers like the Citadel or Virtu. Most of their revenue comes from payment for order flow. That's what the SEC is going to take a look at. What's interesting is that, it's funny, I'm working on another documentary that deals with the AMC phenomenon, and there's a lot of overlap between the two. But when it comes to these younger traders, they want to take a look at the structure of Wall Street and if they are being taken advantage of. So while many traders use Robinhood, there are a significant number who question whether or not there is a conflict of interest, whether or not they are being treated in the best way possible when it comes to getting the best price for their trade, or if Robinhood has a conflict of interests sending it to the firm that will pay them the most, as opposed to the firms that we'll execute the trade for the retail investor in the best way possible. I think it's a double-edged sword for Robinhood. I think they've certainly changed the game when it comes to the overall industry. When you think of how many other brokers now offers zero cost trading, I don't think that we're going to go back. But I do think that the retail investor is smarter and they ask questions. I wouldn't be surprised if eventually, there are some change involved in the business model of Robinhood and some of the other brokers.
Hill: I was going to ask you where you think all of this is going, but in the documentary, you literally go to one of the places where this is going. You go into the metaverse. You go to a place called the Central Land, and you played Blackjack in a virtual casino, like something out of Ready Player One.
Lee: That's the extrapolation of all this. If things aren't real, if this generation is comfortable with operating in this virtual world where money is frictionless, then why not have an avatar that you can dress up in virtual clothes, that you buy for significant sums of cryptocurrency, and operate there, and gamble there, and bet there. That's the next step. Money is frictionless. Operating in a virtual world is a lot easier. We are talking about having to go to a casino physically. A drive to your casino to place a bet. This is one step beyond. You don't even have to get dressed. You don't have to do anything. You could stay near bed, and literally dress your avatar, and go and place a bet. All of these companies are looking at operating in the metaverse. This is just the next step to all of this.
Hill: Every weekday at 5:00 PM, she is the host of CNBC's, Fast Money. But when she's not doing that, she is working on things like Generation Gamble. The new documentary premieres Tuesday, October 5th at 8:00 PM Eastern. Investors are not going to want to miss it mostly. Thanks so much for being here. [MUSIC]
Lee: Thank you so much, Chris. A pleasure. [MUSIC]
Hill: Get ready to take some notes because coming up after the break, Andy Cross and Ron Gross return with a couple of stocks on their radar. Stay right here. You're listening to Motley Fool Money.
As always, people on the program may have interest in the stocks they talk about, and The Motley Fool may have formal recommendations for or against, so don't buy yourself stocks based solely on what you hear. Welcome back to Motley Fool Money. Chris Hill here, once again, with Andy Cross and Ron Gross. Guys, before we get to Radar stocks, I just wanted to touch on two stories that are related because this was a really good week for anyone who is looking forward to the inevitable rise of the machines. [laughs] First, the California DMV approved autonomous vehicle deployment permits for Waymo, which is owned by Alphabet, and Cruise, which is owned by General Motors. They still need approval from the California Public Utilities Commission, but these companies are now one step closer to offering driverless ridesharing services. Ron, [laughs] are you getting in one of these or if you live in California or you're like, ""No, I'd like a human person driving my Uber or Lift.''
Cross: Are you paying for it? That's a big question too. Are you paying for it?
Gross: Chris, you used the word exciting at the lead-in and I would replace that with nervous, very nervous. I'm not an early adopter of things that could cause severe harm. It's really interesting. It's going to be the future. This allows them, as Andy said, to charge a fee, receive compensation for these autonomous services they'll offer to the public, ride-hailing, being one of the bigger ones. We're still in the infancy here. It's going to take some time. They're going to have to develop a track record. I'm OK with Domino's delivering pizzas in Ann Arbor this way, but I'm not sure if I'm getting in the car.
Hill: Andy, you just raised an interesting point. Obviously, they want to charge for this. Any chance, particularly if it's Waymo, which is backed by Alphabet, which has enormous piles of money, any chance that once they finally get approval for this, they just, for a few months say, hey, we're just going to offer this for free just to get people like Ron more comfortable with this [laughs] idea.
Cross: Yeah, very much, maybe. I think that just to start to bill because I think there will be a lot of nervousness from the consumer side. I will say the Cruise permission is for the vehicles are approved to operate between 10 PM and 6 AM. I'm usually asleep by then,[laughs] so I won't be hopping or paying for a Cruise vehicle. The Waymo ones are authorized to go up to 65 miles per hour at certain parts of San Francisco [laughs] and San Mateo counties. That's really interesting, the Cruise ones up to 30 miles an hour and operate in light fog and light rain. It will be interesting to see what they do with this. How much demand they get. Is there interest to be able to pay to go this certain mileage? Then certainly what does Waymo do? They are building on their lead with so many miles in California and Cruise this year. That's dropped a lot this year, with a lot of the testing in 2020 because of the COVID pandemic, but lots of continued testing and consumer interest to determine.
Cross: Chris, you're seeing I could potentially save tens of dollars in order to risk my life. [laughs] You've sold me.
Hill: Also this week, Amazon unveiled Astro, a robot you can have in your home for only $1,000. Astro is the size of a small dog. It moves around on three wheels and has a 10-inch screen. It can play music, TV shows. It also has a camera that can be used for home security and video chat. Ron, obviously, this is version 1.0. Among my thoughts on this is, I'm a little surprised it's Amazon with this and not Apple or Google.
Gross: That's interesting. I didn't think of it that way. I love stuff like this in general, and I eventually, at some point, will be a consumer. I think when it does a little bit more, for example, my wife said, that's interesting. It could bring you a bottle of water from the fridge.'' I'm, like,'' Not really. It doesn't have hands.'' Somebody would have to be there, put it in the little pouch, and then it could recognize your face, and it will be able to map your house. Pretty cool stuff. It'll have obviously an Alexa built-in. This is going to be the future, for sure. We're going to have many robots in our house. We're early on here, and I'm sure you'll see competitors like from Alphabet, like from Apple, as you said. So we will have our choice of $1,000 little mini-robots to choose from. The future is here, Chris.
Cross: A little too much wally looking for me. It is interesting [laughs] it continues to Amazon. They announced a whole bunch of different stuff with cheaper thermostats, and more Rings, different Echoes. So it really does just represent Amazon's desire to start to serve what's going on inside your house. The whole Ring security system that they are building out. More and more evidence that Amazon is really pushing into places where consumers are sitting to be able to order more stuff, whether it's through Alexa, or through their computers, or tablets, or iPhones.
Hill: By the way, Amazon denied that the device is named after Astro, the dog, in the animated show the Jetsons. It's like, ""Come on, we all know that you named it after the dog.""
Gross: The review I read said, ""This is no Rosey the robot. [laughs] We're still early stages here.""
Hill: Let's get to the stocks on our Radar, our man behind the glass, Rick Engdahl is going to hit you with a question. Ron Gross, you're up first. What are you looking at this week?
Gross: Rick, I'm revisiting Editas, E-D-I-T, a stock I have talked about many times before. I own it as part of my personal nine-stock biotech basket. They're an early stage gene therapy company focused on the CRISPR-Cas9 gene-editing technology. Now the reason I'm revisiting it, is that earlier in the week, they released initial clinical data from an ongoing trial that's focused on treating blindness due to a rare disorder of the retina. Following the release of that data, the stock fell 20 percent, but [laughs] that drop seems like an overreaction to me. The trial did show the treatment was effective for patients that received medium dose. I'm scratching my head a little bit about the stock reaction here. Prior to the release, the shares had doubled since May. So this is either a buy on the rumor, sell on the news situation, or there's something in the data that I'm just not understanding right now. I need to dig in more to determine if I stay put or maybe even buy more.
Hill: Rick, question about Editas.
Rick Engdahl: Gene therapy looks very promising, looking into the future. My question is, am I going to be able to live forever or only my kids?
Gross: Interesting. I think in your lifetime you will see this used to treat certain diseases. It won't be widely adopted quite yet, but for our kids, that could be really interesting.
Hill: Andy Cross, what are you looking at?
Cross: PubMatic, Rick and Chris, P-U-B-M, a very small-cap stock, $1.325 billion, $25 stock price, $100 million of cash in the balance sheet, offers a digital sale-side ad tech platform that more than 1200 independent publishers and App developers use. So they use the technology to basically encourage clients, ad clients, and other brands to be able to advertise. They served 46 trillion ad impressions last year. They handle one trillion requests per day. It's really profitable for a small company. They have growth rates of estimating to be 38-40 percent this year. They had a wonderful Q2, really benefiting from the push to be omnichannel, connected TV, Rick so when you think about using all your devices and that's supported by advertising. PubMatic is a small-cap growth company that's really innovative and building out that business. I really like it.
Hill: Rick, question about PubMatic.
Engdahl: I'm a little disappointed. I thought PubMatic was going to be some kind of robot that brought me a beer. [laughs].
Cross: That is a good business to have though.
Engdahl: But do we really need another online advertising platform? Come on [MUSIC]
Cross: I think we do. It's a big average, with huge space and they need a lot of innovation to be able to support those businesses.
Hill: What do you want to add to your watch list, Rick?
Engdahl: I think I don't want my kids to live forever, I'll go with that one.
Hill: Nice. Andy Cross, Ron Gross, guys, thanks for being here.
Cross: Thanks, Chris.
Hill: That's going to do it for this week's Motley Fool Money. The show is mixed by Rick Engdahl. I'm Chris Hill. Thanks for listening. We'll see you next time.

2021-10-10 00:00:00+00:00,Wall St Week Ahead-Energy price spike adds market risk as earnings arrive,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/wall-st-week-ahead-energy-price-spike-adds-market-risk-as-earnings-arrive-2021-10-10,,,"By Lewis Krauskopf
NEW YORK, Oct 8 (Reuters) - U.S. stock market investors are gauging whether more volatility is ahead because of surging global energy prices, which could drive up inflation, erode profit margins and pressure consumer spending.
Stocks rebounded this week after Monday's losses left the S&P 500 .SPX down 5.2% from its record high hit in September. A truce in the U.S. Congress to avoid a debt default provided some relief, but investors remain worried about inflation, higher U.S. Treasury yields and the Federal Reserve's plan to unwind its easy money policies.
Energy costs are a major factor for inflation, and will be a key topic as companies report third-quarter results in coming weeks. Oil prices have surged more than 25% since late August, with Brent LCOc1 topping $80 a barrel and hitting three-year highs. Natural gas prices in Europe have rocketed, causing alarm among political leaders.
Oil prices have a ""roughly neutral"" affect on overall corporate earnings, according to Goldman Sachs strategists, with every 10% increase in Brent prices boosting S&P 500 earnings per share by 0.3%.
Energy shares have soared as crude prices climbed, yet higher prices could weigh on companies ranging from transportation to consumer discretionary firms.
""We are going to find out if this piece of the inflation puzzle is the straw that breaks the camel’s back and actually starts cutting into margins,"" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities. ""There are incremental costs to everything when energy prices go up.""
Despite September's pullback, the S&P 500 remains up about 17% so far in 2021. Even as investors swooped in to buy the market's latest dip, some Wall Street strategists are pointing to risks that could come with jumping into equities.
Analysts at Capital Economics said in a note that rising energy prices could put more upward pressure on bond yields. A jump in yields roiled stocks in recent weeks, particularly tech shares.
If oil prices keep rising toward $100 a barrel, that ""could continue to weigh on sentiment,"" said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors.
""If we break that barrier, I think it will influence how people are forecasting economic growth and inflation and interest rates, which has broad implications for sectors and industries and markets,” Arone said.
As oil gained since late August, the S&P 500 energy sector .SPNY has increased 25% against a 1% drop for the overall index. Energy was the lone sector to post positive performance in September.
The energy sector comprises less than 3% of the weight of the S&P 500, however, and rising oil prices can raise fuel and other costs for companies such as transportation firms, while also threatening demand by leading consumers to pay more, such as for gas at the pump.
JPMorgan strategists in a note this week outlined a basket of stocks negatively impacted by oil at $100 a barrel, including package delivery company FedEx FDX.N, discount retailer Dollar Tree DLTR.O and auto parts retailer O'Reilly Automotive ORLY.O.
In a note last week, U.S. economists at Deutsche Bank said the 101-cent increase in gas prices from a year earlier would be expected to lead to a reduction in income that can be spent on non-energy items of about $120 billion.
However, the relative amount of consumer spending on gasoline and other energy expenditures has trended lower over the past 40 years, according to data from Jack Janasiewicz, portfolio manager at Natixis Investment Managers Solutions.
The percent of personal consumption expenditures devoted to gas and other energy spending has fallen from over 6% in the early 1980s to 2.35% most recently, Janasiewicz said.
And JPMorgan strategists said markets would be able to digest oil at $130 a barrel, as the economy and consumer ""were functioning just fine"" over 2010-15, when oil averaged above $100.
""We do not believe that the current price of energy will have a significant negative impact on the economy,"" the strategists wrote.

2021-10-08 00:00:00+00:00,10 Stocks to Buy for Their Billion-Dollar Buybacks,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/10-stocks-to-buy-for-their-billion-dollar-buybacks-2021-10-08,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Once upon a time, everyone was doing share repurchases. Then Covid-19 hit, and businesses of all sizes were looking to conserve cash. As a result, repurchases went out of vogue. But now they’re back, and many investors look to buybacks as an indicator of stocks to buy for long-term profits.
In the second quarter of 2021, share repurchases for S&P 500 companies reached $198.8 billion. That’s up 11.6% from Q1 2021 and within $24.2 billion of the all-time high of $223 billion seen in Q4 2018.
7 Great Travel Stocks to Buy for Q4
Although 294 S&P 500 companies bought back $5 million or more of their stock in the second quarter, 20 stocks accounted for 55.7% of the dollar value of those buybacks. 
Share repurchases are expected to continue to grow in the third and fourth quarters of 2021. With that in mind, here are 10 stocks to buy from companies that are buying back their shares in 2021:
Masco (NYSE:MAS)
Target (NYSE:TGT)
Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR)
Nucor (NYSE:NUE)
Deckers Outdoor (NYSE:DECK)
Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK)
Home Depot (NYSE:HD)
Yum Brands (NYSE:YUM)
O’Reilly Automotive (NASDAQ:ORLY)
Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)
Stocks to Buy: Masco (MAS)

Buyback Amount: $2 billion
Shares Repurchased in 2021: $750 million 
In June, the home improvement and building products company announced a $350 million accelerated share repurchase (ASR) through the Royal Bank of Canada (NYSE:RY). It is part of the company’s $2 billion share repurchase authorization announced in February 2021. 
Masco paid $58.41 for 85% of the $350 million. The final 15% will be based on the volume-weighted average price between June 9 and July 29. Masco’s current price is approximately the same amount as the price paid in June on its ASR. 
The company’s free cash flow (FCF) over the trailing 12 months (TTM) is $780 million, or 104% of its share repurchases through the first six months of its fiscal year. 
In November 2011, I recommended Sherwin-Williams’ (NYSE:SHW) stock over Masco. Over the past 10 years, Masco has had an annualized total return of 21.4%. That’s good, but not quite as good as SHW at 26.8%. 
Sherwin-Williams remains the more focused company, but I like Masco over the long haul.
Target (TGT)

Buyback Amount: $15 billion
Shares Repurchased in 2021: $2.7 billion 
In the first six months of fiscal 2021, Target repurchased 12.7 million of its shares at an average price of $213.06. That’s up from $609 million in buybacks through the first six months of 2020.
In September 2019, the discount retailer’s board authorized a $5 billion share repurchase program. It started buying its shares in Q1 2020. In August 2021, it started a new $15 billion share repurchase program with no expiration. 
To date, the company has repurchased $3.2 billion under the 2019 program. Once it completes the remaining $1.8 billion in buybacks, it will start on the $15 billion initiative. The company’s return on investment over 24 months is about 23%. 
In April, I recommended seven retail stocks to buy with healthy e-commerce businesses. Target was one of the seven. 
“One of the best CEO hires in recent retail history has got to be Brian Cornell at Target. The discount retailer was faltering badly when he joined the company in August 2014 after executive stints at PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) and Sam’s Club. The first thing he did was close its Canadian stores at the cost of $5.4 billion,” I wrote. 
Cornell isn’t quite in Hubert Joly territory — he rescued Best Buy (NYSE:BBY) from near death — but he’s easily one of the top five CEOs in retail.   
Stocks to Buy: Dollar Tree (DLTR)
DLTR) during the day"" width=""300"" height=""169"">
Source: digitalreflections / Shutterstock.com
Buyback Amount: $2.5 billion
Shares Repurchased in 2021: $950 million
In the six months ended July 31, the dollar-store chain repurchased 9.16 million shares of DLTR stock at an average price of $103.71. It did not repurchase any shares in the first six months of 2020. It has approximately $1.45 billion left on its repurchase authorization plan. 
Dollar Tree’s share price is currently below the average price paid for its buybacks in 2021. Year-to-date (YTD) through Oct. 8, its stock is down almost 10%. 
However, in a move to boost sales and profits, the company recently announced that it will begin selling items for more than $1. DLTR stock jumped by 18% on the news. The company’s Dollar Tree Plus stores will sell products for prices as high as $5 starting by the end of its fiscal year. 
I don’t know what took it so long. Canada’s Dollarama (OTCMKTS:DLMAF) introduced price points above $1 in 2009.   
Nucor (NUE)

Buyback Amount: $3 billion
Shares Repurchased in 2021: $916.1 million
The maker of steel products bought back 12.15 million of its shares in the first six months of fiscal 2021 at an average price of $75.40 a share. In May 2021, the board initiated a new share repurchase program of $3 billion. Approximately $2.8 billion is still available and the program has no expiration date. 
In September, I selected Nucor and nine other companies whose stocks I thought were oversold and made good buys. 
One of my favorite reasons to own NUE stock is that it generates significant FCF. In the trailing 12 months ended July 3, Nucor had FCF of $1.76 billion — plenty to buy more of its stock in the second half of the year. 
Nucor was having a good year until mid-August, when lower commodity prices pushed its shares off an all-time high of $128.81. It now trades in the high-$90s.

Stocks to Buy: Deckers Outdoor (DECK)
Source: BalkansCat / Shutterstock
Buyback Amount: $750 million
Shares Repurchased in 2021: $82.2 million
Deckers, best known for its Ugg boots, saw its Hoka performance footwear blow past its other brands in recent quarters. Not only are its Hoka sales higher than those of Uggs, but the shoes are also more profitable. 
In Q1 2022, Hoka had an operating profit of $46.4 million from $151.1 million in sales. That’s an operating margin of 30.5%, compared to 26.5% for Ugg.
If you’re a longtime owner of DECK stock, I wouldn’t get too worried. Ugg is still the number one revenue generator for the company. However, the first quarter isn’t a traditionally strong quarter for Ugg sales. So wait for the colder months to kick in.
In the meantime, the company repurchased 249,331 shares of its stock in the first quarter at an average price of $329.55. Its return on investment (ROI) on those buybacks is more than 11%. It has $728.5 million left under its existing share repurchase program. 
Decker’s TTM FCF is $500 million. Its current FCF yield is 5%.  
Bank of New York Mellon (BK)

Buyback Amount: $6 billion
Shares Repurchased in 2021: $1.3 billion
In the first half of 2021 through the end of June, Bank of New York Mellon repurchased 29.6 million of its shares at an average price of $44.49. In the third quarter of 2021, it started its new $6 billion share repurchase program. It’s good through Q4 2022. 
Bank of New York Mellon’s ROI on its 29.6 million shares is 27% through Oct. 8.
I honestly can’t remember the last time I mentioned BK stock in an article of mine. However, analysts seem to like the stock. The 19 covering it give BK stock an “overweight” rating and a median target price of $57.    
Founded by Alexander Hamilton in 1784, Bank of New York Mellon is the world’s largest custodian bank. It has $41.1 trillion under its custody or administration. It might not be glamorous work, but it delivers steady profits. 
7 Top-Rated Pharmaceutical Stocks To Invest in for October
Analysts expect it to earn $4.10 per share in 2021 and $4.49 in 2022. Thus, it trades at a reasonable 12.2x forward earnings.    
Stocks to Buy: Home Depot (HD)

Buyback Amount: $20 billion
Shares Repurchased in 2021: $6.9 billion
In the first six months of its fiscal 2021, ended Aug. 1, Home Depot repurchased $6.9 billion of its stock. That’s almost nine times the amount it bought back in 2020. Buybacks were severely cut back last year to maintain liquidity during Covid-19. 
The home improvement retailer repurchased 23 million shares of its stock in the first six months of 2021 at an average price of $300.22. In May, the board approved a new $20 billion share repurchase plan. There is approximately $17.6 billion outstanding and the program has no expiration date. 
Due to the “essential services” tag given to home improvement centers during the pandemic, Home Depot generated $16.4 billion in free cash flow in 2021, 48% higher than in 2020.   
In the second quarter, Home Depot hit $40 billion in sales for the first time in its history. But, retailer or not, HD stock always belongs in a long-term, diversified portfolio. 
Yum Brands (YUM)
Source: designs by Jack / Shutterstock.com
Buyback Amount: $2 billion
Shares Repurchased in 2021: $530 million
In the first six months of 2021, the owner of Taco Bell, KFC and Pizza Hut repurchased 4.7 million of its shares at an average price of $111.64. As a result, it’s got an ROI of more than 10% on its 2021 buybacks to date. 
The repurchases Yum made through the end of the second quarter were conducted under its November 2019 authorization. The new program for $2 billion is good from July 1, 2021 through Dec. 31, 2022. The last share repurchase plan expired with $1.2 billion outstanding. 
In September, Yum Brands made a strategic acquisition of Dragontail Systems, an Australian company specializing in kitchen order management and delivery technology. Although it only paid $69 million for the company, it strengthened Yum’s delivery capabilities.   
7 Best Dividend Stocks to Buy for October
Year-to-date, YUM stock has a total return of 14%, which is less than that of the entire U.S. market. However, over the past 52 weeks, it saw a total return of 32%, which is a far stronger showing. 
Stocks to Buy: O’Reilly Automotive (ORLY)
Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com
Buyback Amount: $1 billion
Shares Repurchased in 2021: $2.2 billion
At first glance, the seller of aftermarket automotive parts looks as though it has a basic share repurchase program for $1 billion. However, a closer look shows it can buy so much more. 
On page 11, note 8 of its Q2 2021 10-Q describes its share repurchase program in more detail. The $1 billion amount referred to above was an increase approved in February. In May, the board approved an additional $1.5 billion. As of June 30, it had $1.9 billion outstanding. 
Since it initiated a program in January 2011, it’s repurchased $15.5 billion of its stock at an average price of $185.60. That’s a compound annual growth rate of 12.7% on the investment.   
In June, I highlighted O’Reilly as one of seven companies with must-read shareholder letters. I was especially taken by its focus on customer service. But, of course, companies that put the customer first usually do alright. 
ORLY is an excellent long-term buy.

Buyback Amount: $60 billion
Shares Repurchased in 2021: $23 billion
When you have a market capitalization above $2 trillion, you’re going to have a large share repurchase program in place. When CEO Satya Nadella took the helm in 2014, the buyback authorization was 33% less at $40 billion. On Sep. 14, the company increased its share repurchase program to $60 billion. It has no expiration.     
In fiscal 2021, which ended June 30, it repurchased 101 million of its shares at an average price of $227.43. Its ROI on those 101 million shares is 29.8% based on current prices. The company had $8.7 billion remaining on its old $40-billion program as of June. 
By every metric, Microsoft is operating at the top of its game. Revenues in 2021 were 21% higher at $46.2 billion. Net income increased 47% to $16.5 billion and free cash flow rose 24% to $56.1 billion.
Trading at 30x cash flow, it’s not cheap, but you get what you pay for.

2021-10-07 00:00:00+00:00,November 26th Options Now Available For Dollar Tree (DLTR),DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/november-26th-options-now-available-for-dollar-tree-dltr-2021-10-07,,,"Investors in Dollar Tree Inc (Symbol: DLTR) saw new options begin trading today, for the November 26th expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the DLTR options chain for the new November 26th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $98.00 strike price has a current bid of $2.60. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $98.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $95.40 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of DLTR, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $99.14/share today.
Because the $98.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 56%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 2.65% return on the cash commitment, or 19.35% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Dollar Tree Inc, and highlighting in green where the $98.00 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $101.00 strike price has a current bid of $2.34. If an investor was to purchase shares of DLTR stock at the current price level of $99.14/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $101.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 4.24% if the stock gets called away at the November 26th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if DLTR shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Dollar Tree Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing DLTR's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $101.00 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $101.00 strike represents an approximate 2% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 53%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 2.36% boost of extra return to the investor, or 17.22% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.
The implied volatility in the put contract example is 47%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 44%.
Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $99.14) to be 34%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

2021-10-07 00:00:00+00:00,INSIGHT-'Containergeddon': Supply crisis drives Walmart and rivals to hire their own ships,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/insight-containergeddon%3A-supply-crisis-drives-walmart-and-rivals-to-hire-their-own-ships,,,"By Lisa Baertlein, Jonathan Saul and Siddharth Cavale
LOS ANGELES, Oct 7 (Reuters) - The Flying Buttress once glided across the oceans carrying vital commodities like grain to all corners of the world.
Now it bears a different treasure: Paw Patrol Movie Towers, Batmobile Transformers and Baby Alive Lulu Achoo dolls.
The dry bulk cargo ship has been drafted into the service of retail giant Walmart WMT.N, which is chartering its own vessels in an effort to beat the global supply chain disruptions that threaten to torpedo the retail industry's make-or-break holiday season.
""Chartering vessels is just one example of investments we've made to move products as quickly as possible,"" said Joe Metzger, U.S. executive vice president of supply-chain operations at Walmart, which has hired a number of vessels this year.
The aim is to bypass log-jammed ports and secure scarce ship space at a time when COVID-19, as well as U.S.-China trade ructions, equipment shortages and extreme weather, have exposed the fragility of the globe-spanning supply lines we use for everything from food and fashion to drinks and diapers.
More than 60 container ships carrying clothing, furniture and electronics worth billions of dollars are stuck outside Los Angeles and Long Beach terminals, waiting to unload, according to the Marine Exchange of Southern California.
Pre-pandemic, it was unusual for more than one ship to be  in the  waiting lane at the No. 1 U.S. port complex, which handles more than half of all American imports.
Other big retail players, such as Target TGT.N, Home Depot HD.N, Costco COST.O and Dollar Tree DLTR.O, have said they are chartering ships to deal with the pandemic-driven slowdown of sea networks that handle 90% of the world's trade.
Or, as Steve Ferreira of shipping consultancy Ocean Audit describes the escalating concern: ""Containergeddon.""
U.S. retailers' traditional lifeline from Asia is freezing up due to a resurgence of COVID-19 in countries like Vietnam and Indonesia plus a power-supply crunch in China. The supply snarls coincide with booming demand as consumers spend more on goods than going out, and the festive shopping frenzy nears.
Burt Flickinger, managing director at retail consultancy Strategic Resource Group, said at least 20-25% of the goods stuck on ships were unlikely  to make it onto shelves in time for the Nov. 26 Black Friday kickoff for the holiday shopping season, a period when retailers make more than a third of their profits.
ROUTE FOR GREAT PROFIT
The biggest chains are taking matters into their own hands.
In a typical year, Walmart would have moved those toys from China to Los Angeles in hundreds of 40-foot (12-metre) cargo boxes stacked like colorful Lego bricks on gigantic container vessels that serve multiple customers.
But 2021 is far from typical. Incoming cargo at the Port of Los Angeles is up 30% from last year's record levels. Trucks and trains can't remove it fast enough, leading to logjams, said the port's Executive Director Gene Seroka, reflecting the surge in consumer demand.
""It's like taking 10 lanes of freeway traffic and squeezing them into five,"" Seroka said.
Chartered ships that offer valuable cargo space and can sidestep the container terminals play a critical role in this second pandemic holiday season, particularly for time-sensitive goods like Christmas sweaters that won't sell if they arrive too late.
The Flying Buttress, for example, entered Los Angeles waters on Aug. 21. It got stuck in a queue outside the port before it bypassed clogged terminals and unloaded its goods at a separately operated bulk cargo dock nearby on Aug. 31, according to Refinitiv data and shipping records.
During that voyage, Walmart circumvented the shortage of 40-foot containers typically used for global shipping by switching to bigger 53-foot containers that are almost exclusively used to move goods by truck and train within the United States.
Other companies are also playing the shipping game including Home Depot which said it was ""creatively working to obtain additional capacity"".
The home improvement retailer dodged the Los Angeles gridlock by sending its Great Profit charter ship nearly 125 miles south to the Port of San Diego.
On Sept. 15, the ship's onboard cranes hoisted 7-foot Halloween ""Spellcasting witches"", Christmas lights and other holiday decor onto docks there, said Ocean Audit CEO Ferreira, who helps shipping customers claw back overpayments.
""This is the home stretch. They're doing whatever it takes"" to win in an overheated market, he said of retailers.
WHY PORT SIZE MATTERS
Yet there is a limit to such workarounds.
Great Profit moored at a terminal that handles everything from sugar to windmill blades but can only accommodate a maximum of 500 containers from one to two ships per month between now and the end of the year, said Greg Borossay, the port's maritime business development principal.
That's because San Diego, like many other U.S. seaports, doesn't have the towering gantry cranes needed to pluck boxes from massive ships. Rail service is equipped for autos and other specialty cargo. And, roads in surrounding commercial and residential areas aren't set up for the fleets of trucks needed to whisk thousands of containers to other parts of the country.
""We'd have a very unhappy community if we had 3,000 (boxes) coming off a ship,"" Borossay added.
Not all retailers will hire ships to support sales, and other factors could be significant in picking out potential winners and losers.
Clothing and accessory retailers have seen their inventories decline even as sales have accelerated, stoking worries about sell-outs, said Jason Miller, associate professor of logistics at Michigan State University's business college.
General merchandise retailers like Walmart and Target, on the other hand have done a better job of keeping inventory on pace with sales, he added.
PAYING $20,000 PER CONTAINER
The global supply crunch is providing lucrative opportunities for bulk cargo ship operators, though; they are cashing in on a record spike in container shipping rates that has sent freight costs above $20,000 per box on the biggest liner vessels.
Global container shipping players like AP Moller Maersk MAERSKb.CO and Hapag Lloyd HLAG.DE, are flush with cash from the soaring rates. Major lines are ""putting in every ship we can find"", Hapag Lloyd CEO Rolf Habben Jansen said.
Several shipping sources said other firms were snapping up second-hand container vessels of all sizes.
Hong Kong-based Taylor Maritime, which according to shipping databases manages the Flying Buttress, did not respond to a request for comment.
Dry bulk transporters have a short window of time to prepare decks to safely secure and carry cargo boxes. They typically transport commodities in below-deck cargo holds.
Genco Shipping & Trading GNK.N is seeking approval from its ship safety certifier to prepare some of its own dry bulk vessels to carry containers.
Genco isn't going all-in on container shipping, said CEO John Wobensmith, who called the project ""opportunistic"".
Separately, agribusiness giant Cargill [RIC:RIC:CARG.UL] said it is looking into using some of the dry bulk ships it charters to instead hold containers, if only as a temporary solution, to ""alleviate bottlenecks"".

2021-10-06 00:00:00+00:00,"Bed Bath & Beyond Just Proved How Very, Very Broken Retailers' Supply Chains Are",DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/bed-bath-beyond-just-proved-how-very-very-broken-retailers-supply-chains-are-2021-10-06,,,"If there was any doubt Bed Bath & Beyond (NASDAQ: BBBY) is truly struggling to get its hands on enough inventory, CEO Mark Tritton just wiped it away. As he explained during the second-quarter conference call on Sept. 30, ""[W]e do see supply chain pressure continuing, both in cost and lead time."" Tritton backed up his comment by cautioning shareholders that same-store sales for the quarter currently underway would likely be flat, ultimately translating into full-year earnings of between $0.70 and $1.10 per share. Analysts had been modeling a fiscal 2021 bottom line of $1.32 per share.
And it's not just Bed Bath & Beyond. Shares of athletic apparel maker Nike (NYSE: NKE) also recently tumbled after the company dialed back its full-year revenue guidance due to supply chain woes. Department store chain Kohl's (NYSE: KSS) was recently downgraded by Bank of America to a rating of underperform with analyst Lorraine Hutchinson citing its struggle to get inventory into stores. Dollar Tree (NASDAQ: DLTR) is in the same proverbial boat, as are a slew of other retail chains.
Still, it's difficult to get a grasp on just how big the supply chain problem really is. Fortunately for investors, there's a metric that puts things in perspective. Unfortunately, this fiscal measure's condition may paint an even more alarming picture than what is currently expected for the retail industry.

You can't sell it if you don't have it
It's not a commonly considered data nugget, even for store chains. These are unusual circumstances though, where consumers stand ready to spend their money with retailers that have the right merchandise.
The metric in question is a simple comparison of a retailer's on-hand inventory versus that chain's most recent quarterly sales figure. You'll often see it expressed as a ratio, although some sources provide it as the number of days -- at its current sales pace -- it would take to sell through all of that merchandise. Both point to the same premise.
And as you might suspect, inventory-to-sales ratios have turned downright ugly since early 2020 for many names in the business. As of Feb. 2020, U.S. retailers (excluding the automotive industry) collectively boasted an inventory-to-sales ratio of 1.43. As of July 2021, that figure has fallen to 1.11, which is still within sight of April's all-time record low of 1.07. The visualization of this data from the U.S. Census Bureau below puts things in perspective.

It's not as if things have improved in the meantime either. Indeed, for some retailers, supply chain problems may have been exacerbated over the course of the past quarter. That certainly seems to be the case for Bed Bath & Beyond, which reported a year-over-year same-store sales drop of 1% for the three-month stretch ended Aug. 28, despite huge strides made in terms of pushing back on COVID-19's impact.
Data source: Thomson Reuters. Chart by author. Dollar figures are in millions.
Meanwhile, Nike and Kohl's are exhibiting a similar deterioration in inventory levels with each at or near rock-bottom supply levels for this particular time of year. Although not shown, Dollar Tree's inventory picture is just as troubling.
Data source: Thomson Reuters. Chart by author.
And remember, Tritton suggested more than once during Bed Bath & Beyond's earnings call that he sees his company's ""supply chain pressure continuing, both in cost and lead time."" Nike doesn't think it's nearing an end either. CFO Matthew Friend conceded during last month's fiscal 2022 first-quarter call, ""We now expect fiscal '22 revenue to grow mid-single digits versus the prior year versus our prior guidance of low double-digit growth due solely to [...] supply chain impacts.""
The industry as a whole looks like it's headed into the all-important holiday shopping season not only understaffed but undersupplied as well.
Investors better buckle up
The headwind will eventually end, but even before then, each of these retailers is adapting. Bed Bath & Beyond continues to beef up its private-label efforts with the introduction this month of home decor house brand Studio 3B, circumventing at least one supply chain middleman. As Dollar Tree CFO Michael Witynski noted during his company's most recentearnings call Dollar Tree is now ""using dedicated space on chartered vessels for the first time, including one large vessel contracted for three-year term."" Nike is responding, too.
These are only small answers, however, to an enormous problem. Relative to sales, retailers only have about three-fourths the amount of inventory they had prior to the pandemic's arrival in the U.S. Consumers can't buy something that's not available, setting the stage for disappointing holiday results.
In other words, buckle up for a challenging end to the year for many retailers.

In comparison, the broader S&P500 index declined marginally over the same period. Last week, the company announced that shoppers will see more goods priced above the retailer’s ubiquitous $1 price point. The market reacted upward to this major strategic change to the company’s merchandising strategy. Having said that, higher prices will also help relieve much of the margin pressure the company is facing due to rising transportation costs and supply chain constraints. The company’s concept store called Dollar Tree Plus will offer a wide range of goods and price points, and based on the customer receptiveness to higher-price points – the company could expand these stores from 500 to more than 5000 by 2024. Separately, Dollar Tree also expanded its existing stock-buyback program from $1.45 billion to $2.5 billion.

2021-10-06 00:00:00+00:00,Here's Why a Market Crash Might Be Good News for This Growth Stock,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/heres-why-a-market-crash-might-be-good-news-for-this-growth-stock-2021-10-06,,,"The stock market is sending ominous warning signals lately. For the month of September, the S&P 500 index fell nearly 5%. After rising on the first day of the month, the index is seeing red again. But not all businesses will suffer if the market's volatility is correctly forecasting economic troubles ahead.
That's why shareholders of Five Below (NASDAQ: FIVE) might not need to fear the downturn like investors in some other companies. In fact, its product selection, target customers, and growth plans might actually mean shareholders could benefit. Here's how.
Image source: Getty Images.
Its selection of products is difficult to copy
Admittedly, it seems counterintuitive to think that a retailer could benefit from a market crash. But Five Below has carved out a desirable niche.
Its trendy yet affordable products aren't the kind that its young customers can easily find elsewhere. The company groups its products into eight categories, including sports, tech, room, and style. It has been able to capitalize on trends like fidget spinners and selfie sticks while also crafting deals with brands like Disney (NYSE: DIS), Lego, and Crayola.
It's led to incredible growth even through a pandemic. Sales over the past 12 months were almost $2.6 billion. That's 40% more than they were in the fiscal year that ended January 2020. Since 2015, the year after Joel Anderson was named CEO, revenue has climbed 279%. That number pales in comparison to cash from operations and net income.
FIVE Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts. TTM = trailing 12 months.
The stores are a destination for its young customers
Its customers trend very young. The company targets Gen Z kids ages 8 to 14 and millennial parents 24 to 44. Unlike some other bargain stores like Dollar Tree (NASDAQ: DLTR) and Dollar General (NYSE: DG), Five Below has customers across a broad income spectrum. The company claims more than one-quarter have a household income above $100,000 per year.
Those customers also shop frequently and take their time browsing. More than 70% spend at least 15 minutes shopping. And they visit the store an average of 10 times per year. That supports the idea that Five Below is cultivating a desirable experience. It's a destination, not just a place to grab an item on your shopping list.
Need more proof? The company's stores are typically in high-traffic shopping centers with lots of alternatives. Yet more than half of the customers surveyed had already planned to make Five Below the first stop. Management has recognized the demand and been rapidly expanding the footprint.
Economics demand management splurge on growth
Five Below opened its 100th store in 2008. Store No. 1,000 opened its doors 12 years later. The pace hasn't slowed. The store count is growing at 20% per year and was supported by five distribution centers (one of them dedicated to e-commerce) at the end of 2020. This year, the company has opened another in Arizona and has a seventh slated for 2022 in Indiana. The hubs are needed. Management anticipates opening between 170 and 175 new stores in 2021 alone.
There is no end in sight. Nor should there be. The company reports a payback of less than one year on newly opened stores. Before the pandemic, normalized metrics showed a 150% return on investment for new stores. At that rate, it would be irresponsible not to open as many new stores as possible.
That's why even if the market crashes and the stock drops, I'll be buying shares. Five Below has figured out a formula for engaged, dedicated shoppers in a segment of the market that benefits from people looking for bargains. If the market crashes and economic uncertainty rises, expect Five Below to take share and maintain its growth trajectory.

2021-10-05 00:00:00+00:00,Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR) can Reignite Earnings Growth with Higher Price Points and Share Buyback,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/dollar-tree-nasdaq%3Adltr-can-reignite-earnings-growth-with-higher-price-points-and-share,,,"By Richard Bowman
This article originally appeared on Simply Wall St News.
Last week the share price of Dollar Tree, Inc . ( NASDAQ:DLTR ) jumped 16% after the company announced an additional share buyback, and that it will begin to sell higher priced items. The sudden increase in the share price may seem like an overreaction to the news - but both announcements could actually make a big difference to Dollar Tree’s earnings growth outlook.
Retailers like Dollar Tree have been more immune to the effects of e-commerce than high end retailers. But inflation is a big problem when you limit your upside with a one dollar price point. The chart below illustrates that analysts have been expecting earnings to remain flat over the next few years, despite rising revenue. This would result from rising costs, without a corresponding increase in the price charge for each item.
NasdaqGS:DLTR Earnings and Revenue Growth October 5th 2021
Dollar Tree is in the fortunate position of having much stronger margins than most retailers. The company manages a gross margin of 31% and a net margin of nearly 6%. By contrast, Walmart ( NYSE:WMT ) has a gross margin of 25% and a net margin below 1%. Good margins are great when it comes to profitability but don’t help with growth, unless there are opportunities to expand the company’s footprint.
Improving Earnings Growth
Dollar Tree is now using two other options it has to increase earnings growth:
It plans to begin adding new price points above $1 across all Dollar Tree Plus stores . It has already tested the concept at some stores, and will now implement the additional price points at all Dollar Tree Plus stores and begin testing new price points at legacy stores. This will allow the company to increase the range of products it can sell as well as the margin on each product.
Dollar Tree has also announced that it will increase its share buyback program by $1.05 billion to an aggregate amount of $2.5 billion . The initial buy back program was announced in March this year. This means the company can now buy back as much as 25 million shares, or about 10% of the outstanding shares. The average daily volume is around 3.2 million shares. By reducing the share count, earnings per share will rise as long as net income doesn't fall.
Dollar Tree’s Valuation
Our estimate of Dollar Tree’s valuation, which is based on analyst estimates, is $151.46 - more on this calculation here . This implies the stock is still trading at a 35% discount after last week’s rally. While the stock price appears reasonable, investors are often reluctant to invest in companies with limited growth prospects. This is illustrated by the stock’s price-to-earnings ratio (or ""P/E'"") of 14.9X. This is substantially lower than the broader market’s P/E ratio of 17.8X - but not surprising as Dollar Tree is expected to grow earnings at a slower rate than the market.
Raising prices and buying back shares should allow the company to grow earnings, and lead to a higher P/E ratio in the future.
Is there an opportunity in Dollar Tree?
Just how much these initiatives will increase earnings growth remains to be seen - Which is probably why analysts have yet to update their forecasts. But it does provide a potential catalyst for an improved outlook, which could lead to a more permanent re-rating for the stock. The share buyback may also provide some support for the stock price,

Riding the comfort trend
With sales gains accelerating over the past four quarters, Crocs (NASDAQ: CROX) is experiencing unprecedented growth thanks to consumers' heightened focus on comfort. In the most recent quarter, revenue soared 93.3%, as Crocs registered record sales of $641 million in the three-month period that ended June 30. The company's famous clogs accounted for 74% of business, with sandals and Jibbitz (customizable shoe charms) being other key product categories.
Crocs has really shown adeptness at boosting its brand relevance, relying on social media and digital channels, as well as influencer campaigns and collaborations, to drive consumer awareness.
""We were the first footwear brand to market an augmented reality experience on TikTok, with our hashtag #GetCrocd challenge, featuring try-on sandals and clogs with Jibbitz. Globally, this drove over eight billion views and over one million uses of the hashtag,"" CEO Andrew Rees said on the earnings call. Crocs also recently worked on partnerships with Justin Bieber and Spanish luxury fashion house Balenciaga.
Direct-to-consumer revenue, consisting of items moved on the company's website or through its own stores, represented more than 50% of sales in the quarter. And Crocs' 61.7% gross margin, which is higher than Nike's, is truly remarkable given that the average selling price during Q2 was just $21.84. The operating margin of 30.5% is stellar as well.
Management believes that Asia, and particularly China, is the next major growth opportunity. Crocs will deploy the same branding and marketing strategy that's working so well here in the U.S., leaning heavily on digital and social media to drum up interest.
Crocs is certainly firing on all cylinders today, but investors are right to wonder whether this is just a short-lived pandemic surge or something more sustainable. Based on the smart moves the company is making, this $9 billion mid-cap stock could be winning for a long time.

Beating its discount-store peers
You wouldn't expect a brick-and-mortar retailer to be in this discussion, but Five Below (NASDAQ: FIVE), with its 1,121 nationwide stores and 51.7% year-over-year sales growth, definitely warrants an investment today. The discount store chain's stock, up 344% over the past five years, has advanced much faster than that of bigger rivals Dollar General and Dollar Tree.
Five Below focuses on teens and tweens, offering a wide assortment of items such as beauty products, clothing, and home décor, all priced below $5. And the business has a Five Beyond section for merchandise higher than $5, utilizing a treasure-hunt shopping atmosphere that encourages consumers to spend extra time in the store. It's no wonder that the average customer visits a Five Below 10 times and buys 60 different items per year. What's more, the annual household income of these customers is $73,000, so the company isn't just attracting the most budget-conscious consumers.
Over the past decade, Five Below has been opening new stores at breakneck speed, more than quintupling its footprint since 2011. And management thinks the U.S. can eventually handle 2,500 locations, which would be more than twice the current number. This makes a lot of financial sense, though, given that each store generates more than $2.1 million in annual sales volume. Furthermore, when analyzing the initial build-out cost of a new store versus its year-one profitability, Five Below sees an outstanding 150% return on investment.
Wall Street analysts are expecting earnings to skyrocket 200% from fiscal 2020 through fiscal 2023, signaling a very bullish view of the company's prospects. With all the negative talk of the demise of physical retail, Five Below stands out by carving a niche within the sector. Adding this dominant business to your portfolio is a sound financial decision.

NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - The American dollar store is the modern-day version of what was known during the Depression era as the five-and-dime. But as with the stores that sold goods for pocket change back then, inflation and changing habits are now taking their toll on dollar stores.
After several decades of selling most wares for $1 apiece, Dollar Tree on Wednesday said https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210928006082/en/Building-on-the-Success-of-its-%E2%80%9CCombo%E2%80%9D-Store-and-Dollar-Tree-Plus-Initiatives-Dollar-Tree-Poised-to-Take-Next-Steps-in-its-Multi-Price-Evolution it plans to roll out more so-called Plus stores, which will also sell items for $3 and $5. The decision follows skyrocketing shipping costs that have crimped the company’s ability to make money. Chief Executive Michael Witynski told the Wall Street Journal that higher wages and supplier cost pressures were also causing problems https://www.wsj.com/amp/articles/dollar-tree-to-sell-more-items-above-1-as-costs-rise-11632918816.
In the past, when pocketbooks were squeezed, shoppers flocked to cheap sellers. During the recession https://www.breakingviews.com/considered-view/dollar-general-ipo-a-rare-bright-spot-for-kkr/?bved=NDI%3D&bvshr=ODE5NA%3D%3D from December 2007 to June 2009, Dollar Tree’s stock shot up almost 50% while the S&P 500 Index fell more than a third. Helpfully, inflation was low during that period, too.
For now, not least because the U.S. government continues to help people with lower incomes, they don’t need Witynski’s rock-bottom prices as much. Along with rising costs, analysts expect the company’s sales to grow just 3% this year, according to Refinitiv data.
In one sense, Dollar Tree and rival Dollar General simply have a superficial problem with their names as they relate to long-term inflation. Even a five- and 10-cent store back in August 1932 would now be selling things for $1 and $2, adjusted for consumer price increases since then. Shorter-term cost spikes just bring that trend into sharp focus.
But crises have a tendency to accelerate the adoption of new habits, too. Just as five-and-dimes that gave away free glassware were a fad that morphed, Covid-19 has changed buying patterns from online shopping for toilet paper to a rebalancing of restaurant and at-home dining. Dollar Tree is trying to offer more choices and appeal to more people. That means gradually encroaching on the territory of giant retailers like Walmart. For Witynski, that's a bigger kind of challenge than the fact that every George Washington buys less than it used to.

NAME SYMBOL RECENT PRICE AVG. ANALYST 12-MO. TARGET % UPSIDE TO TARGET
First Trust Nasdaq Retail ETF FTXD $34.11 $37.50 9.93%
Dollar Tree Inc DLTR $95.71 $107.57 12.39%
RH RH $666.91 $745.71 11.82%
Advance Auto Parts Inc AAP $208.89 $229.83 10.03%
Are analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past. These are questions that require further investor research.

2021-09-30 00:00:00+00:00,Interesting DLTR Put And Call Options For November 12th,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/interesting-dltr-put-and-call-options-for-november-12th-2021-09-30,,,"Investors in Dollar Tree Inc (Symbol: DLTR) saw new options begin trading today, for the November 12th expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the DLTR options chain for the new November 12th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $94.00 strike price has a current bid of $3.05. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $94.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $90.95 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of DLTR, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $95.20/share today.
Because the $94.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 100%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 3.24% return on the cash commitment, or 27.52% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Dollar Tree Inc, and highlighting in green where the $94.00 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $96.00 strike price has a current bid of $3.30. If an investor was to purchase shares of DLTR stock at the current price level of $95.20/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $96.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 4.31% if the stock gets called away at the November 12th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if DLTR shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Dollar Tree Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing DLTR's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $96.00 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $96.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 3.47% boost of extra return to the investor, or 29.40% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.
Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $95.20) to be 34%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.
