2021-09-10 00:00:00+00:00,3 Top Stocks for the Back-to-School Season,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-top-stocks-for-the-back-to-school-season-2021-09-10,,,"It's the time of year when students say goodbye to their much-loved summer vacations and say hello to classes again. Not only does this annual event have implications for pupils, parents, and teachers, but it also provides certain public companies with a lucrative business boost.
A team of Motley Fool contributors have identified three top stocks for the fall back-to-school season. Read on to see why Five Below (NASDAQ: FIVE), Mondelez International (NASDAQ: MDLZ), and Target (NYSE: TGT) all make solid investments right now.

Crushing discount-store rivals
Neil Patel (Five Below): With a stock that has outperformed larger peers Dollar General and Dollar Tree over the past year, Five Below is a discount-store chain you want to add to your back-to-school shopping list.
Five Below has built a reputation of selling quality products at bargain prices, mainly for girls and boys ages eight to 14 years old and their parents. The business offers up a treasure hunt shopping experience, with items ranging from home d√©cor and tech gadgets to toys and beauty products. Prices are usually from $1 to $5, but some products can be as ""expensive"" as $10.
Apparel is a key back-to-school category that Five Below is doing well at right now. ""Our merchandising team sourced some great value products like denim jackets, flannel shirts, and backpacks for the new school year. We are very pleased with our performance through August,"" said CEO Joel Anderson on the recent earnings call. But with a wide assortment of school supplies as well, Five Below can really be an important destination for many shopping needs.
The business has been growing rapidly over the years, more than doubling its store count from the end of fiscal 2016 to today. But don't think that this impressive expansion is over. Management firmly believes that Five Below can one day operate 2,500 locations in the U.S. That's up significantly from 1,121 stores today.
Revenue of $647 million in the most recent quarter (Q2 2021) is 55% higher than the same period in 2019 (for a pre-pandemic comparison). And same-store sales (or comps) during that time soared 21%, a figure most any retailer would be envious of, particularly after the pandemic's negative impact on the industry. Further supporting Five Below's stellar financial metrics is a balance sheet with zero long-term debt, providing safety in adverse economic times.
The stock is down more than 20% over the past couple weeks primarily because of a disappointing earnings report, but don't worry. The long-term growth story is still clearly intact for this discount retailer. Use the recent pullback to add Five Below's stock to your shopping bag.
The perfect lunchbox stock
Eric Volkman (Mondelez International): Back to school means back to kids' lunchboxes. And kids' lunchboxes mean snacks. Finally, very often in this world, snacks mean Mondelez International, one of the biggest players in that segment of the food industry.
If you're an American consumer, it's almost certain that you've eaten one of Mondelez's products -- or perhaps even have a few in your pantry at this very moment. The company has an impressive portfolio of brands that cut across traditional snack categories, including Oreo and Chips Ahoy! cookies, Ritz and Triscuit crackers, and Toblerone chocolate.
Mondelez, a tireless acquirer of assets, has built up that portfolio by plowing money into new assets. In May, for example, the company closed a $2 billion deal for European croissant and baked snacks specialist Chipita. That, by the way, was the fourth Mondelez acquisition in the first half of 2021 alone.
The coronavirus pandemic helped lift the company's results, as consumers stuck in their homes spent more money on comfort snack food such as Oreos and Ritz crackers. In its latest reported quarter, Mondelez managed to grow its net revenue by 12% on a year-over-year basis, with non-GAAP (adjusted) net income coming in 8% higher.
It seems the company believes the ""coronavirus effect"" on its fundamentals will cool down; for the entirety of 2021 it's guiding for 4% in organic net revenue growth, and an adjusted per-share earnings improvement in the high-single-digit percentages. I feel Mondelez might be underestimating the lasting effects of the coronavirus; comfort foods have a way of staying on shopping lists once they're rediscovered.

Mondelez is also estimating that its free cash flow will be over $3 billion. This gives it the financial fuel to help pay for those acquisitions, and to fund its dividend. Since effectively coming into existence (hived off from the former Kraft Foods) in 2012, Mondelez has paid a dividend in every quarter and raised it once per year. Across that stretch of time, it has risen from $0.13 per share to the present $0.35, for a yield of 2.3%.
So it's basically a fine dividend stock with clear potential for growth thanks to its strong brand lineup and well-considered acquisitions. It certainly deserves a place in any investor's pantry.
A one-stop shop
Jeremy Bowman (Target): The coronavirus pandemic spoiled back-to-school in 2020, but this year consumer-facing companies of all stripes are eager to capitalize on the return to school.
Arguably, none is better positioned than Target. The big-box chain has thrived over the last year thanks to its same-day fulfillment services, diverse product selection, and its omnichannel model offering a hybrid of in-store and online shopping.
Back-to-school is usually a bright spot for Target as it's well positioned to sell apparel, accessories, electronics, and school supplies as well as home goods for college students arriving on campus. The retailer's assortment of owned brands, which has been a bright spot for the company recently, also gives it an advantage over its retail peers, as many of the products that draw in Target customers are unique. For example, the company just launched a collaboration with popular children's book author Christian Robinson.
On the recent earnings call in August, management said that back-to-school and back-to-college are ""off to a great start,"" and the company has introduced a feature in its app called School List Assist, helping users easily find all the school supplies they need.
Target is also better positioned than competitors like Amazon and Walmart to convert those sales into profits. The company's retail business produces higher operating margins than those two rivals, thanks to Target's focus on owned brands and its strategy of fulfilling most of its online sales through its stores. This is much more cost-effective, and often faster, than shipping them to the customer.
Finally, even after a strong run during the pandemic, Target shares look cheap, trading at a price-to-earnings ratio under 20. For a retailer forecasting high-single-digit comparable sales growth for the back half of the year, that looks like a great price.

2021-09-08 00:00:00+00:00,3 Beaten-Up Stocks for Bargain Hunters,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-beaten-up-stocks-for-bargain-hunters-2021-09-08,,,"Buying shares of a stock when it is falling can be a way to set yourself up for some gains later on when the business bounces back. But not every struggling stock is going to recover, so it's important to understand the reason for a decline. If the business itself is solid, a drop in value may simply create an attractive opportunity to invest.
Three stocks that have been falling in recent weeks that could be great buys today are Amgen (NASDAQ: AMGN), Alibaba Group Holdings (NYSE: BABA), and Dollar Tree (NASDAQ: DLTR). They have all fallen more than 7% in the past month (the S&P 500 is up over 2%), but there's a lot to like about these businesses over the long haul.
Image source: Getty Images.
1. Amgen
Drugmaker Amgen is a relatively cheap stock to own today, trading at a price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 23 (the average stock in the Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund is trading at 27 times its profits). And yet, the stock continues to fall. At about $226, it is getting closer to its 52-week low of just over $210.
Many healthcare companies have been struggling amid the pandemic as hospitals and doctors have been shuffling priorities in an effort to keep COVID-19 under control. During the first three months of the year, Amgen's revenue of $5.9 billion declined 4% year over year; the company blamed the poor results on the pandemic and patient visits being down. However, for the period ending June 30, sales of $6.5 billion were up 5% as the company was starting to benefit from a recovery in the economy. Its drug for high cholesterol, Repatha, showed exceptional performance, with revenue rising 43% from the same period last year.
Over the longer term, the company will get a boost from its lung cancer drug Lumakras. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted accelerated approval for the drug (which means another trial is still necessary) in May. According to analysts, Lumakras could generate more than $1.4 billion in revenue for Amgen as early as 2023.
The surge in cases of the delta variant of the coronavirus, and the subsequent uncertainty surrounding the economic recovery, may be one of the reasons investors are once again bearish on Amgen. Given its low earnings multiple and 3.1% dividend yield (above the S&P 500 average of just 1.3%), there's a lot to like about this stock without even factoring in its growth or its potential as a ""recovery play.""
2. Alibaba
E-commerce giant Alibaba is an intriguing stock because it has the potential to deliver incredible returns or equally startling losses -- it all depends on the Chinese government and what remains a risky political environment, especially given that relations with U.S. don't appear to be improving. Earlier this year, China assessed a $2.75 billion antitrust fine on Alibaba stemming from its monopoly power.
If you are OK with taking on risk and uncertainty, there's loads of potential here. As one of the country's top tech companies, Alibaba trades at a P/E of only 21. That's cheap for a tech stock. Amazon and Shopify, which also run large e-commerce platforms, trade at multiples of 61 and 80, respectively. Investing in the China-based company may provide a good hedge for North American investors who are worried about COVID-19, as case numbers in China have remained relatively stable compared with the rest of the world. And that can translate into some strong, consistent growth.
Alibaba's revenue of $31.9 billion for the period ending June 30 was up 34% year over year. While commerce is still its bread and butter, generating 87% of its revenue, the growth in cloud computing could offer promising opportunities in the future -- that segment accounted for just 8% of sales but grew at a rate of 29%.
The tech stock is coming off 52-week lows, and it's still a cheap investment to own. While there's some risk here, the company is a major player in e-commerce. And although fines may shrink its bottom line, that shouldn't take away from its potential over the long term.
3. Dollar Tree
Discount retail stock Dollar Tree is another business that investors have been bearish on amid inflation and rising freight costs. The retailer is one of the top importers in the country, and management anticipates that shipping-related issues will not resolve themselves anytime soon. Dollar Tree noted on its recent earnings call that industry experts believe capacity won't increase until 2023 (when there will be more ships available for transport), at which point costs should decline.
That sounds like bad news, but what I like about it is that the company is baking in some low expectations for the future. As investors know, it's the way a business executes against expectations that typically dictates how its stock performs. Lowering the bar will make it easier for the company to outperform and deliver a surprise result in future earnings reports. For fiscal 2021, Dollar Tree projects that its net sales will be a little over $26 billion (in 2020 they were at $25.5 billion) and diluted earnings per share will be within a range of $5.40 to $5.60 (versus $5.65 last year).
Like the other stocks on this list, Dollar Tree isn't an expensive buy, trading at a P/E of just under 15. This is less than the 21 times earnings that investors are paying for rival retailer Dollar General. But if you're planning to hang on to the stock for awhile, Dollar Tree could be an underdog worth buying right now. While it's not at its 52-week low of $84.41, it's getting close to that level.

(NASDAQ:DLTR) insiders sold a significant stake in the company which may have piqued investors' interest. When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying versus if they selling is usually more beneficial, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.
Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing.
Dollar Tree Insider Transactions Over The Last Year
Over the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the insider, Thomas Saunders, for US$19m worth of shares, at about US$113 per share. While insider selling is a negative, to us, it is more negative if the shares are sold at a lower price. The good news is that this large sale was at well above current price of US$92.81. So it may not tell us anything about how insiders feel about the current share price.
Over the last year, we can see that insiders have bought 10.60k shares worth US$1.1m. On the other hand they divested 220.58k shares, for US$25m. All up, insiders sold more shares in Dollar Tree than they bought, over the last year. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below.

For those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.
Dollar Tree Insiders Are Selling The Stock
Over the last three months, we've seen notably more insider selling, than insider buying, at Dollar Tree. We note Enterprise Chief Merchandising Officer Richard McNeely cashed in US$772k worth of shares. On the other hand we note Independent Director Jeffrey Naylor bought US$248k worth of shares. Because the selling vastly outweighs the buying, we'd say this is a somewhat bearish sign.
Insider Ownership of Dollar Tree
For a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. Dollar Tree insiders own about US$281m worth of shares (which is 1.3% of the company). Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.
So What Do The Dollar Tree Insider Transactions Indicate?
The insider sales have outweighed the insider buying, at Dollar Tree, in the last three months. Despite some insider buying, the longer term picture doesn't make us feel much more positive. But since Dollar Tree is profitable and growing, we're not too worried by this. While insiders do own a lot of shares in the company (which is good), our analysis of their transactions doesn't make us feel confident about the company. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. You'd be interested to know, that we found 2 warning signs for Dollar Tree and we suggest you have a look.

2021-09-03 00:00:00+00:00,Here's Why Dollar Tree Is Worried About Rising Costs and Dollar General Isn't,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/heres-why-dollar-tree-is-worried-about-rising-costs-and-dollar-general-isnt-2021-09-03,,,"It's curious: Management at discount retailer Dollar Tree (NASDAQ: DLTR), also parent to the Family Dollar chain, made a point of cautioning shareholders during the company's most recent quarterlyearnings callthat rising freight costs would be biting pretty deeply into profits, at least through the current quarter. Rivals Dollar General (NYSE: DG) and the much smaller Big Lots (NYSE: BIG) didn't express similar concerns during their latest earnings releases.
There's a good reason one of these organizations is issuing a warning in the form of lowered guidance, while the other two aren't. And it's not a conscious decision to ignore potential problems and hope for the best. Whereas Big Lots and Dollar General are mostly buffered from rising freight costs, Dollar Tree has considerably less wiggle room in terms of profit margin.
Image source: Getty Images.
No breathing room
Cutting straight to the chase, Dollar General is roughly 30% more profitable (as measured by margins) than Dollar Tree.
The graphic below comparing the historical operating margin rates for all four of the country's key discounters tells the tale. Dollar General's operating profit margin for the past four quarters averages out to 10.1%, but it's only a little less than 8% for Dollar Tree.
Similarly positioned Ollie's Bargain Outlet (NASDAQ: OLLI) is roughly twice as profitable as Dollar Tree, while Big Lots' bottom line is more or less in line with Dollar Tree's. But that's to be expected given Big Lots' smaller size -- in retail, more scale typically lowers relative costs. Perhaps most important, the chart illustrates just how unpredictable Dollar Tree's already-low margin rates have been since 2015.
Data source: Thomson Reuters. Chart by author.
Some investors already know it, but if you're wondering why Dollar Tree's profitability plunged so dramatically in 2015, blame the acquisition of Family Dollar.
When it was solely dedicated to the $1 price point, Dollar Tree boasted industry-leading profitability rates. Family Dollar didn't, reporting operating profit margin rates of only 4% and 6.6% in the two years before the deal was consummated. The cost synergies anticipated by bringing Family Dollar into the fold simply haven't panned out.
Now, six years into the project, it's unlikely they ever will.
Why isn't scale working out for Dollar Tree?
Still, the profit margin disparity is striking given how similar these four retailers' business models are. What gives?
As it turns out, these companies' respective business models aren't actually all that similar where it matters most. The two biggest differences in Dollar Tree's operation are the key reasons it's waving red flags now.
CEO Michael Witynski fleshed out one of these headaches in detail during last month's second-quarter earnings call. ""Dollar Tree brings in nearly 90,000 40-foot [shipping] containers per year, predominantly for the Dollar Tree banner,"" Witynski said, adding ""the Dollar Tree banner imports more containers per $100 million in sales than other large retailers.""
He then explained, ""The Dollar Tree banner is more sensitive to freight costs than others in the industry."" And it is. Witynski pointed out that certain maritime freight routes Dollar Tree relies on now cost 400% more than they did in 2019.
End result: The company's previous per-share estimate of 2021 freight costs of $0.60 to $0.65 as of May has since swollen to an estimate of between $1.50 and $1.60 per share. Given the details of Dollar Tree's supply chain logistics, the anticipated doubling of freight costs isn't likely to be a setup to underpromise and overdeliver, either.

The other impasse disproportionally impacting Dollar Tree and its Family Dollar division is that Dollar Tree isn't able to procure inventory the way that Ollie's, Big Lots, and Dollar General do.
Again, it's the sort of nuance that would be easy to overlook if you aren't looking for it. It's evident upon closer inspection, though. Dollar General offers a lot of private-label goods designed and priced specifically for its target customer. Ollie's and Big Lots offer plenty of closeout goods: merchandise that other U.S. retailers have given up on selling and are willing to pass along to another retailer for pennies on the dollar.
That's not to suggest Dollar Tree doesn't offer any private-label goods or buys all of its inventory from overseas suppliers. But it is seemingly not making the same house-branding and value-offering connections with consumers that its rivals are.
A problematic distinction
The big takeaway for investors is, don't dismiss Dollar Tree's concern. But also don't assume that Dollar Tree's warning universally applies (or at least applies to the same degree) to seemingly similar discount retailers.
All discounters are certainly feeling the impact of rising fuel costs and other inflation factors. Only one of the aforementioned names, however, is specifically less investment-worthy because of it.
That's Doller Tree. And while it might try to adapt, it's tough for retailers to simply find new suppliers and/or new delivery routes. There are hundreds of such partners, and they tend to serve existing, proven customers before taking on new ones that might not be interested in a more permanent relationship with vendors and logistics service providers.

Sept 1 (Reuters) - Walmart Inc WMT.N said on Wednesday it planned to hire 20,000 workers at its supply chain division ahead of the busy holiday season as the world's largest retailer and other major rivals battle a logistics and labor crunch.
The roles, a mix of part-time and full-time jobs ranging from freight handlers to lift drivers, will be offered at 250 Walmart and Sam's Club distribution centers, fulfillment centers and transportation offices, the world's largest retailer said.
A nationwide labor shortage due to the COVID-19 pandemic has spurred retailers to raise wages this year, with many worried that they will not have enough workers in stores and warehouses during the holiday shopping season.
Walmart said on Wednesday the average wage for supply chain associates it plans to hire will be $20.37 per hour. It raised average pay for U.S. hourly workers earlier this year to at least $15.25 an hour.
Walmart did not disclose the cost of the additional hiring.
Retailers are also grappling with rising freight costs due to bottlenecks at ports and container ship shortages as economies recover from a pandemic-led slowdown.
Low-price retailer Dollar General Corp DG.N said on Wednesday it was looking to hire more workers at stores and distribution centers as well as truck drivers.
The discount chain, which has hired more than 50,000 employees since mid-July, is offering a $5,000 sign-on bonus to drivers as it expands its private fleet.
Rival Dollar Tree Inc DLTR.O is offering a $1,000 sign-on bonus to ensure its distribution centers are sufficiently staffed ahead of the holiday season.
Last month, grocery chain Aldi [RIC:RIC:ALDIEI.UL] announced plans to hire more than 20,000 U.S. workers across its stores and distribution centers and raise its wages.
E-commerce giant Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O will hire 55,000 more workers to keep up with demand in retail, its cloud services and advertising, among other businesses,its new chief executive, Andy Jassy, told Reuters on Wednesday.

2021-08-31 00:00:00+00:00,Look Under The Hood: RTH Has 11% Upside,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/look-under-the-hood%3A-rth-has-11-upside-2021-08-31,,,"Looking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at ETF Channel, we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. For the Retail ETF (Symbol: RTH), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $201.72 per unit.
With RTH trading at a recent price near $180.93 per unit, that means that analysts see 11.49% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of RTH's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are Dollar Tree Inc (Symbol: DLTR), Dollar General Corp (Symbol: DG), and TJX Companies, Inc. (Symbol: TJX). Although DLTR has traded at a recent price of $90.93/share, the average analyst target is 17.59% higher at $106.93/share. Similarly, DG has 11.73% upside from the recent share price of $225.36 if the average analyst target price of $251.79/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting TJX to reach a target price of $81.27/share, which is 11.63% above the recent price of $72.80. Below is a twelve month price history chart comparing the stock performance of DLTR, DG, and TJX:
Combined, DLTR, DG, and TJX represent 9.85% of the Retail ETF. Below is a summary table of the current analyst target prices discussed above:
NAME SYMBOL RECENT PRICE AVG. ANALYST 12-MO. TARGET % UPSIDE TO TARGET
Retail ETF RTH $180.93 $201.72 11.49%
Dollar Tree Inc DLTR $90.93 $106.93 17.59%
Dollar General Corp DG $225.36 $251.79 11.73%
TJX Companies, Inc. TJX $72.80 $81.27 11.63%
Are analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past. These are questions that require further investor research.

2021-08-27 00:00:00+00:00,Three Reasons to Buy Ford (F) and GM (GM) at Current Levels,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/three-reasons-to-buy-ford-f-and-gm-gm-at-current-levels-2021-08-27,,,"A
uto-manufacturing stocks saw strong gains in the first five months of the year, but since early June, they have been falling as a group. The big two in the U.S., Ford (F) and GM (GM), have dropped by 22% and 24%, respectively, in that time. There is an old market saying that you should never try to catch a falling knife, but in this case, I will make an exception to that rule. Both F and GM are buys at these levels for three reasons.
1. Rare Value
Let‚Äôs get one thing out of the way. In stock analysis, as in life in general, a low price doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean value. If F and GM had fallen by over 20% because their businesses had collapsed or were about to collapse for some structural reason, they would still be expensive, even at the lower price. If, however, the price falls because of an inherently short-term issue or a warped investor perception but underlying fundamentals are still strong, they can be seen as offering value.
And that is a scarce commodity in the stock market these days. An awful lot of assumed good news has to be priced in for the major indices to keep hitting new highs as the Delta variant causes a resurgence in the disease. In those circumstances, when indices trail and forward multiples are well above historical norms, a below average P/E should always draw attention, but especially so when the low multiple is not a product of expectations for weak or even negative future growth.
To consider value, analysts often use the PEG ratio, a number derived by dividing the trailing P/E of a stock by the average annual growth, as forecasted by Wall Street analysts for the next five years. A PEG ratio of below 1.0 is considered to indicate value, so Ford, with a PEG of 0.18 and GM with 0.78, are both technically value stocks.
That, in itself makes them worthy of consideration, but only if things are going to get better, and there are reasons to think that is the case.
2. The Temporary Nature of Supply Disruptions
The main reason for the decline in auto stocks over the last three months is the worsening supply constraints, which have caused a cut in production and a reduction in revenue and profit forecasts. There is no doubt that the supply chain issues in the industry, particularly when it comes to computer chips, are bad. But they are also by nature, temporary.
The problem is that the laws of supply and demand, which would normally bring things back to equilibrium have been distorted, but distortion is not the same as destruction. If there is a shortage of chips, or anything for that matter, the price tends to move higher, which encourages investment in more production. That investment, though, has been delayed in this case because the pandemic has restricted trade flows around the world. However, unless you believe that the world will be actively fighting Covid forever, those restrictions will ease at some time and the demand for chips, and therefore autos, will be met.
3. Retail Patterns Indicate Sustained Demand
So far, shortages have not hit profits at Ford and GM too hard. Both companies beat expectations for EPS last quarter, largely because the strong demand for news vehicles enabled them to raise prices. Trends in non-auto retail suggest that the pricing power is going to be here for a while longer, even as supply and sales volume are restored.
Discount retailers Dollar Tree (DLTR) and Dollar General (DG) both reported earnings yesterday, and both gave pessimistic outlooks along with their results. By contrast, however, high end and luxury retailers such as Tapestry (TPR) expect performance to continue. Consumers are buying big ticket items, not dollar store stuff. Price sensitivity among consumers therefore seems to be low, which will enable car manufacturers to keep prices high as they increase output.
Auto stocks have been retreating from their highs for a while, but any one of these three things taken alone would be reason enough to believe that the selling of F and GM is a bit overdone. They clearly indicate that this particular falling knife is worth grabbing, so averaging into both stocks over the next few weeks or months looks like a good long-term play.

Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 1: Ulta Beauty (ULTA)

Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ:ULTA) initially popped higher on earnings, but it‚Äôs just about flat on the session after fading from the highs.
Everyone but the technicians likely thought this one was heading higher. However, shares pushed right up toward the 161.8% extension from the first quarter of 2020 range ‚Äî a major range ‚Äî and faded from there.
It was a picture-perfect reaction.
From here, we need to see how the stock handles itself from here. Specifically, where does support come into play? Is it the 10-day moving average? Below could put the $355 area on the table, along with the rising 50-day moving average.

However, if Ulta can take out the post-earnings higher, $420-plus is possible.
Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 2: Dollar General (DG)

The dollar stores reported earnings and at the end of Thursday, Dollar General (NYSE:DG) won the battle. Shares opened considerably lower on the day, but ended the day down just under 4%. Compare that to the 12% decline in Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR), and DG stock looks much better.
After initially breaking below $220, shares snapped back over this mark and reclaimed $225. Now testing into the 50-day moving average, this area becomes critical.
If DG stock can stay above the 50-day moving average, it could go on to fill the gap up near $233.
If it can‚Äôt stay above it, though, the $220 level remains vulnerable. Back below that mark puts the post-earnings low in play, followed by the 200-day moving average.

As for Dollar Tree, the action is much worse as the stock hits new 2021 lows. It‚Äôs clear that major support was forming near $97. That level held as support for the last several months ‚Äî until today.
Unfortunately, that kind of puts the stock in no man‚Äôs land right here. For now, even the monthly moving averages are being broken, although perhaps DLTR stock will recover them by the end of the month.
On the downside, the 161.8% extension comes into play near $91.25. If it can‚Äôt find its footing there, then sub-$90 could be in play.

However, if shares can recover the $97 mark, the $100 level and the major daily moving averages could be in play. For now, though, DG stock is an easier read than DLTR stock ‚Äî at least when it comes to the charts.
Top Trades for Tomorrow No. 4: Xpeng (XPEV)

Lastly, we have Xpeng (NYSE:XPEV), which tried to rally on the day, but is seeing a painful reversal in development. At one point, shares were up 4% on the day, but it has since given up its gains.
Worse, this rejection comes after the stock momentarily cleared the 21-day, 50-day and 200-day moving averages.
Now we must keep a close eye on the $39.75 area. Below that puts XPEV stock below the post-earnings low, as well as all of its major moving averages. That could put a move down to uptrend support (purple line) in play, if not worse.
Some may even consider a move below this level as a short, with a stop just over the post-earnings high. For others, selling short a name like this isn‚Äôt even a consideration.
On the upside, though, we need to see XPEV stock clear the 50-day. Above that, and downtrend resistance is on the table.

NEW YORK, Aug 26 (Reuters) - Wall Street closed lower on Thursday, ending a streak of all-time closing highs on concerns over developments in Afghanistan, while fears of a potential shift in U.S. Federal Reserve policy prompted a broad but shallow sell-off the day before the Jackson Hole Symposium.
All three major U.S. stock indexes ended the session in the red, with the S&P and the Nasdaq notching their first down day in six.
The sell-off firmed after hawkish commentary from Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan and a blast outside the Kabul airport in Afghanistan helped strengthen the risk-off sentiment.
Kaplan, who is not currently a voting member of the Federal Open Markets Committee, said he believes the progress of economic recovery warrants tapering of the Fed's asset purchases to commence in October or shortly thereafter.
Kaplan's remarks followed earlier comments from the St. Louis Fed President James Bullard, who said that the central bank is ""coalescing"" around a plan to begin tapering process.
""(Kaplan‚Äôs statements) caused a little confusion about the taper timeline, but in my opinion the equity markets are focused on geopolitical issues,"" said Megan Horneman, director of portfolio strategy at Verdence Capital Advisors in Hunt Valley, Maryland. ""There‚Äôs a flight to safety during geopolitical tensions.""
""I am surprised the market the market hasn‚Äôt fallen more, given the fear that it could take focus away from (U.S. President Joe Biden's) domestic agenda,"" Horneman added.
The economy grew at a slightly faster pace than originally reported in the second quarter, fully recovering its losses from the most abrupt downturn in U.S. history, according to the Commerce Department. But jobless claims, though still on a downward trajectory, ticked higher last week.

The data did little to move the needle with respect to expectations that the Fed is unlikely tip its hand regarding the taper timeline when Chairman Jerome Powell unmutes and delivers his speech at Friday's virtual Jackson Hole Symposium.
""We‚Äôre going to see a lot of market participants analyze every word (Powell) uses, but at the end of the day, they will begin tapering,"" Horneman said. ""I‚Äôm more concerned about the speed at which they taper. What are they going to start with? That will give us a clearer indication as whether they‚Äôre getting more hawkish.""

Michael A. Witynski -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Thank you, Randy, and good morning everyone. On this morning's call, we're going to discuss our strong operating performance, talk through some of the headwinds facing our industry, and share details on the robust and accelerated strategic initiatives we have underway to drive short and long-term value creation.
I am proud of our team's continuing efforts, especially in our stores and distribution centers to adapt and react in this dynamic environment, to serve customers and deliver improvements in both operating margin and earnings. Our second quarter earnings per share of $1.23 represented a year-over-year quarterly increase of 12% and 62% when compared to Q2 of 2019.
We continue to see strong performance in discretionary side of the business, and our key initiatives including H2, Dollar Tree Plus and the new Combo Stores are delivering compelling results. All three concepts have performed very well, and we are significantly accelerating these initiatives in 2022 and beyond.
Regarding the continuing and well publicized challenges in the global supply chain, as well as higher freight costs and other inflationary pressures, our teams are working hard to navigate these issues while staying focused, as always on delivering the value and convenience our shoppers expect. I want to share more details on these challenges, how they affect our business and the actions we are taking to best manage and mitigate the impacts.
In recent quarters, we have spoken about the freight cost environment, both international and domestic. As you have certainly seen in the media and elsewhere, freight costs have reached unprecedented levels as a result of increased demand, limited capacity and shipping delays. For context, three months ago, the Shanghai Containerized Freight Index, which reflect spot rates on ocean freight from China was already at an all-time high, up more than 280% year-over-year and more than 400% since 2019.
Now, these rates have continued to rise, and have increased more than 20% since we last reported on May 27th. According to the recent Journal of Commerce, annual ranking of the top 100 importers, Dollar Tree ranked as the fifth largest among retailers. Dollar Tree brings in nearly 90,000, 40-foot containers per year, predominantly for the Dollar Tree banner. As you can see in the slide deck on the Investor Relations portion of our website, at dollartreeinfo.com, we believe the Dollar Tree banner imports more containers per $100 million in sales, than other large retailers. And combined with our low $1 price point, we have an outsized impact from freight cost.
After the first quarter of 2021, our updated freight outlook assumed that our regular ocean carriers would fulfill only 85% of their contractual commitments and assumed -- we also assume the higher spot -- the spot market rates. However, we are now -- project that our regular carriers will fulfill only 60% to 65% of their commitments, and the spot market rates will be much higher than previously estimated.
This shortfall is caused by a variety of factors such as equipment shortages, equipment situated in wrong location, significant backlogs and delays in both China and US ports, outbreaks of COVID causing labor shortages or closure of entire terminals, and the lingering effects of the Suez Canal blockage. To give you a real life example of the kinds of challenges we're seeing, one of our dedicated charters was recently denied entry into China because a crew member tested positive for COVID, forcing the vessel to return to Indonesia to change the entire crew before continuing. Overall, the voyage was delayed by two months. With the current pressure on carriers, once disruptions in the supply chain occur, there is not enough capacity to make it up.
During a recent transportation webinar, a San Francisco-based freight forwarder stated the transit times from Shanghai to Chicago have more than doubled to 73 days from 35 days. Another transportation executive from a carrier recently estimated that voyages are now taking 30 days longer than in previous years due to port congestion, container handling delays and other factors.
The Dollar Tree banner is more sensitive to freight costs than others in the industry. Our products have lower price points than other retail importers. And, as a result, our freight costs are a higher percentage of our gross merchandise margin. The good news is, our initial product margin, which exclude freight have been improving as evidenced by our most recent overseas product purchases, included for manufacturers in more than two dozen countries.
Even in this inflationary environment, we continue to meet or exceed our desired initial product margins at values attractive to our customers. As freight cost moderate in the future, we are confident when paired with our team's significant efforts to enhance our supply chain, this will become a material tailwind contributing to a better product margins.
Industry experts expect the ocean shipping capacity will normalize no later than 2023 when many new ships come online. We are not counting on material improvements in 2022, especially in the first portion of the year.
As a result, we are working proactively to reduce the freight cost impact and otherwise improve gross margin merchandise. Examples of steps we are taking include, using dedicated space on chartered vessels for the first time, including one large vessel contracted for three-year term, which is scheduled to make its first voyage within weeks.
We are expecting to add more charters this year. We're adding alternative sources of supply, both domestic and international that do not rely on Transpacific shipping. We expect some of this shift could become permanent. As an example, Dollar Tree and Family Dollar were well prepared for back-to-school season which alternatively sourced domestic product. We're taking a fresh look at which SKU should be prioritized for import and which should be alternatively sourced; prioritizing containers based on seasonality, the margin impact and our overall inventory needs.
We'll be continuing to pull forward seasonal purchases by 30 days. We're optimizing which China and US ports we use to take advantage of the shipping availability, and our operations team is delivering shrink improvements through technology, enhanced processes and disciplined execution. We are confident that our teams will allow us to navigate through this period of global supply chain challenges.
In addition to the supply chain channel news, we are also being impacted by labor shortages in our distribution centers and stores. Steps we are taking to combat these trends include: Hosting national hiring events; Paying sign on bonuses; Offering enhanced wages in select markets; Paying tuition reimbursement and, more. All designed to be more competitive and a tight market for talent.
We're continuing to optimize our DC network by reducing stem miles, partnering with suppliers to optimize and minimize the length of haul for inbound freight, testing, validating and expanding self checkout in our stores, and developing and utilizing more efficient processes, both in our stores and DCs.
Despite these challenges affecting our industry, I'm very pleased with the team's performance to deliver a 62% improvement in EPS in Q2 when compared to 2019. Now, let's talk about the exciting path forward. I'd like to highlight some of the key initiatives we have in place, especially Dollar Tree Plus in our combo stores, which are helping to position our Company for the future.
We are incredibly excited about the results we are seeing. As we have discussed in the past, we are well positioned to serve customers across all types of markets, urban, suburban and rural. The Family Dollar H2 continues to perform very well. In Q2, we renovated 435 stores into the H2 format, and now have a total of approximately 3,300 H2 stores.
Importantly, we are accelerating the expansion of Dollar Tree Plus initiative and the rollout of Combo Stores to better serve customer's needs and drive sustainable long-term value. We have been carefully improving and calibrating our Dollar Tree Plus initiative with a better understanding of the multi-priced offerings and greater values. Customers are increasingly embracing the Dollar Tree Plus concept, which provides extraordinary value in the discretionary categories they most desire while enhancing store productivity.
As we have refined the Dollar Tree Plus concept, the operating metrics have achieved strong results and have provided us valuable insights that are enabling accelerated expansion. On average, stores with Dollar Tree Plus are experiencing an overall sales lift of approximately 6% with a similar lift in gross profit, improved contribution of approximately 13%, and a payback on investment of less than a year. For obvious reasons, we are focused first on large stores, and we are already seeing similar positive results as we are now implementing into smaller stores. We currently have the multi price assortment in about 340 stores, and we expect to be at 500 stores by year-end.
Building on this continued success, we are planning to add Dollar Tree Plus to an additional 1,500 stores in fiscal 2022. And, we aim to have at least 5,000 Dollar Tree Plus stores by the end of fiscal 2024. Many of our new stores will also be opening up as Dollar Tree Plus stores. This past March, we announced that our newest store format, the Combo Store, leveraging the strengths of both banners under one roof, to provide shoppers with extreme value and merchandise excitement. These stores represent another way to introduce the multi price assortment to Dollar Tree shoppers, and the $1 assortment to Family Dollar shoppers, a major benefit from the Dollar Tree and Family Dollar combination.
We currently have 105 Combo Stores, and I believe we can reach 3,000 of these stores in rural markets alone. Demonstrating our great confidence in Combo Stores as a strategic format, more than 85% of our new Family Dollar stores will be Combo Stores in fiscal 2022. We anticipate 400 new, renovated or relocated Combo Stores next year. We are also in the process of validating the combo store concept and other demographic markets and are excited about the possibilities.
Our larger Combo Stores on average are delivering 23% more sales, 31% more gross margin dollars, approximately 120% more cash contribution dollars, and are reducing payback time by approximately 30%. New Combo Stores compared to similar size stores are showing sales increases of 17%, and even more encouraging, our renovated or relocated Combo Stores are delivering greater than 40% more sales when compared to Family Dollar stores that have not been renovated or relocated. Details about our Combo Stores are available at www.familydollar.com/combostores.
I will now hand the call over to Kevin to provide details on Q2 performance and our outlook.
Kevin S. Wampler -- Chief Financial Officer
Thanks Mike, and good morning. Our second quarter EPS of $1.23 per share is an increase of 12% from the prior year's quarter and 62% compared to the second quarter of 2019. Consolidated net sales increased 1% to $6.34 billion, comprised of $3.26 billion at Dollar Tree and $3.08 billion at Family Dollar.
Enterprise same-store sales decreased 1.2% as we cycled a strong 7.2% from a year ago, representing a 6% increase on a two-year stacked basis. Comps for the Dollar Tree segment decreased 0.2%. Family Dollar same store sales decreased 2.1% cycling a very strong 11.6% increase from last year. On a two-year stacked basis, Dollar Tree comps increased 2.9% and Family Dollar increased 9.5%.
Dollar Tree's comps was comprised of a 1.1% increase in traffic, offset by a decline in average ticket. Family Dollar experienced a 3.5% decline in traffic, partially offset by an increase in average ticket. We do believe that Dollar Tree's traffic has continued to be hindered by a lack of shopper mobility, as more than half of the workforce continues to work remote. Gross profit was $1.86 billion for the quarter. Gross margin was 29.4% compared to 30.5% in the prior year's quarter. Gross profit margin for the Dollar Tree segment declined 130 basis points to 32.4% when compared to the prior year's quarter.
Factors impacting the segment's gross margin performance included merchandise cost including freight, increased 175 basis points, driven by increased freight costs, which was partially offset by favorable mix net of [Phonetic] mark-on. Occupancy costs increased 10 basis points as a result of loss of leverage due to the comparable store sales decline. Shrink improved 55 basis points related to favorable inventory results and a decrease in the shrink accrual rate. And, distribution costs decreased 5 basis points cycling COVID-19 related expenses in the prior year.
Gross profit margin for the Family Dollar segment declined 110 basis points to 26.1% in the second quarter, year-over-year delta included the following. Merchandise costs including freight increased 175 basis points related to higher freight costs and increased sales of lower margin consumable merchandise. Occupancy costs increased 35 basis points as a result of the comparable store sales decrease. Shrink improved 50 basis points related to favorable inventory results and a decrease in the shrink accrual rate, distribution costs, improved 20 basis points compared to the prior year quarter due to the lower COVID-19 related costs. And, mark down costs decreased 25 basis points compared to last year based on civil unrest costs incurred a year ago.
Consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses improved 150 basis points to 23% of total revenue compared to 24.5% in Q2 last year. For the second quarter, the SG&A rate for the Dollar Tree segment as a percentage of total revenue improved 170 basis points to 22.3% when compared to the prior year's quarter.
Payroll costs improved 155 basis points, primarily due to decreased COVID-19 related store payroll costs. Other SG&A decreased by 20 basis points resulting from lower general liability insurance costs, primarily offset by increased debit and credit card fees. Store facility costs decreased 5 basis points due to lower repairs and maintenance costs. And for the Family Dollar, the second quarter SG&A rate as a percentage of total revenue was 21% compared to 21.9% in the prior year's quarter.
Payroll cost decreased 95 basis points, primarily due to decreased COVID-19 related store payroll and incentive comp costs, partially offset by deleverage related to the comp store sales decline. Store facility costs decreased 30 basis points, driven mainly by lower repairs and maintenance costs due to expense incurred from civil unrest in the prior year's quarter.
Other SG&A expense increased 35 basis points, primarily due to increased advertising and travel expense compared to the prior year and depreciation and amortization expense increased 10 basis points due to deleverage on the comp sales. Corporate and support expenses as a percent of total revenue decreased 20 basis points compared to the prior year's quarter primarily due to lower incentive and equity compensation.
Operating income increased 7.3% to $402.2 million compared with $374.9 million in the same period last year and operating income margin was 6.3% in the second quarter compared to 6% in prior year quarter. The second quarter of 2021 included total incremental operating costs of $3 million for COVID-19 related expenses compared to $134.9 million in the second quarter of 2020. Non-operating expenses totaled $33 million, comprising net interest expense and our effective tax rate was 23.5% compared to 23.1% in the prior year's second quarter.
Company had net income of $282.4 million or $1.23 per diluted share, and this compared to net earnings of $261.5 million or $1.10 per share in the prior year's quarter. Combined cash and cash equivalents at quarter end totaled $720.8 million compared to $1.42 billion at the end of fiscal 2020. Outstanding debt as of July 31st was $3.25 billion.
In Q2, we repurchased approximately 7 million shares of our common stock for $700 million. We currently have $1.45 billion remaining on our share repurchase authorization. Inventory for Dollar Tree at quarter end increased 13.1% from the same time last year while selling square footage increased 3.7%. Inventory per selling square foot increased 9%. Inventory for Family Dollar at quarter end increased 10.9% from the same period last year, while selling square footage increased 2.1%.
Inventory per selling square foot increased 8.6%. Both banners' store inventory levels are below 2019 levels at quarter-end. Capital expenditures were $229.1 million in the second quarter versus $232.5 million in Q2 last year. For fiscal 2021, we now expect that consolidated capital expenditures will be approximately $1.1 billion. Depreciation and amortization totaled $176.1 million for Q2 compared to $168.1 million in the second quarter of last year. And for fiscal 2021, we expect consolidated depreciation and amortization to be approximately $720 million.
Our outlook for the remainder of 2021 includes the following exemptions. We expect continued pressure on wages due to the current shortage of workers available for our distribution centers and stores. Spec [Phonetic] Shrink will continue to be a tailwind as we go through the back half of the year, but not at the same rate as we begin cycling improved results from the prior year.
Net interest expense is expected to be approximately $34 million in Q3 and approximately $134 million for fiscal 2021. We estimate consolidated net sales for the third quarter will range from $6.40 billion to $6.52 billion, based on a low single-digit increase in same-store sales for the combined enterprise. Diluted earnings per share are estimated to be in the range of $0.88 to $0.98.
Consolidated net sales for full fiscal 2021 are expected to range from $26.19 billion to $26.44 billion, based on a low single-digit increase in same-store sales and 3.4% square footage growth. The Company now estimates diluted earnings per share will range from $5.40 to $5.60.
Freight costs for fiscal 2021 are now expected to be $1.50 per diluted share to $1.60 per diluted share higher than fiscal year 2020 expressed in terms of the impact on diluted earnings per share. The updated outlook includes $0.60 to $0.65 per diluted share, or $185 million to $200 million, of additional freight costs since our prior guidance on May 27, 2021. As Mike noted earlier, the market condition for freight have continued to deteriorate since our update in May. These changes include the significant difficulties our regular contract carriers are having in meeting their original commitments as well as continuing increases in the spot market rate. These disruptions have affected the timing of inventory receipts and have affected sales of mix.
Our outlook assumes a tax rate of 22.7% for the third quarter and 23% for fiscal 2021. Weighted average diluted share counts are assumed to be 225.9 million shares for Q3 and 228.9 million shares for the full year. Our outlook does not include any additional share repurchases, although, as I said before, we still have $1.45 billion remaining on our existing share repurchase authorization.
I'll now turn the call back to Mike.
Michael A. Witynski -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Thank you, Kevin. Our core business is strong. As Kevin stated, our updated outlook for fiscal 2021 is $5.40 per share to $5.60 per share. It's unfortunate that the global supply chain is in the condition it is, which is expected to result in a year-over-year drag to our business of $1.50 per share to $1.60 per share. If freight costs this year were similar to what we were just a year ago, we estimate that our earnings per share would be in the range of $6.90 to $7.20 for this fiscal 2021.
The work of our teams has been remarkable. Our store and distribution center teams continue to demonstrate their commitment to serving our shoppers each and every day. Our customer satisfaction survey scores have never been higher. We have been -- we have seen improvements across the board for store cleanliness, assortment, service and speed of checkout.
The merchants are delivering greater values to our customers that are meeting or exceeding our initial merchandise margin targets. Our buyers are disciplined, nimble and committed. While it represents a smaller part of our overall business, our digital team saw a 70% increase in sales versus the first half of 2021. We're also pleased with the solid performance of our local delivery program through Instacart. Our initiatives are driving improved results. Customers are responding to Dollar Tree Plus, the H2 format and our new Combo Stores.
We are pleased to accelerate both these initiatives in fiscal 2022. The supply chain issues, which we are confident are transitory in nature will take some time until the global demand and supply for equipment is rebalanced. Importantly, we believe the foundation of our business is stronger than ever. We believe we are in the process of materially improving the long-term earnings power of our business for years to come.
Before we get into questions, there's another topic I want to quickly touch on because it's important to all of us here at Dollar Tree. Recently, Morning Consult reported that the public views Dollar Tree as one of the ten most trusted retail brands in America. We see this as a validation of our core mission of delivering value and convenience to our customers, but it also reflects our commitment to the broader communities we serve.
As I wrote in our 2021 corporate sustainability report, Dollar Tree strives to be the best corporate citizen for all stakeholders and the thousands of neighborhoods, towns and rural markets where our stores are located. And that means taking concrete actions to implement our sustainable vision. One recent step I can share, we are executing on our climate goals by pursuing two new solar projects for our stores and distribution centers. These will provide up to 6 megawatts of renewable power, taking that usage off the carbon grid for years to come.
These, and other efficiency projects show that our efforts to build out the infrastructure for sustainable growth are now taking root. Additionally, our executive leadership team has leaned in on commitment to fostering an inclusive work environment, where the individual differences are understood, respected and appreciated as a valuable source [Phonetic] to strengthen our Company.
This strategy is designed to evolve our culture and sustained momentum through the guidance of our executive council that ensures leadership accountability to our very important DEI objectives. We constantly seek to improve all aspects of our business and that includes areas like store safety, healthier product offerings and many other that are so important to our associates, our customers, our neighbors and our shareholders.
You should know that we always strive to be transparent on these topics. I look forward to providing future updates on the strides we are making. In summary, there is a lot of inspiring news at Dollar Tree. We are excited that our strategic store formats, our accelerated growth plans, and many key sales and traffic driving initiatives, along with our robust balance sheet and commitment to sustainable growth will enable us to deliver long-term value for our stakeholders.
Operator, we are now ready to take questions.
Questions and Answers:
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. We'll go ahead and take our first question from Matthew Boss with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.
Matthew Boss -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst
Great, thanks.
Great, thanks. So Mike maybe overall, how do you feel about the health of the Dollar Tree banner today? Any factors to consider that impacted the second quarter? Should we expect similar comp performance in 3Q? And just overall, how do you see Dollar Tree concept relative to 2% to 3% sustainable comps looking back as we look forward?
Michael A. Witynski -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Thanks, Matt. Yeah, we feel very good about Dollar Tree looking forward, especially in the inflationary times where the $1 price point will mean more to customers than ever, and our ability to continue to procure the product at the margins that we expect. The second quarter, there was still some trip consolidation going on due to the COVID implications out there.
And we saw that in the summer, of course, everybody in the country went on vacation twice to make up for last year. And there is the -- between that and there is not really any huge holidays during the summer that Dollar Tree does so well on. What I do like, and what I'm really encouraged about is, our average ticket is continuing on a two-year stack to be at 21% to 22%. That's amazing growth over 2019. And if we can get that Dollar Tree traffic going along with that basket size, I really believe we're going to like the results. And especially as we look ahead of us, we've got back-to-school, fall, Halloween, Thanksgiving and Christmas. And with schools opening back up and offices hopefully opening back up and traffic moving around, and the trips aren't so consolidated, I believe there is upside for us.
And we saw a little bit of -- while we weren't happy with the traffic in Q2, it was positive for the first time in four quarters. So we're very confident that Dollar Tree is going to have sustainable growth in that low single digit comps.
Matthew Boss -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst
Great. And then maybe just a follow-up, maybe for Kevin, and maybe also Mike at the end, just outside of freight, your underlying core business guidance this year, and you kind of walked through this in your opening remarks, actually increased by $0.20, I think at the midpoint. So maybe just anyway to speak to the factors that drove the increased outlook outside of freight this year.
And I guess my second part of that question is, as we look forward, are there any impediments preventing the acceleration of the Dollar Tree Plus concept that you announced today from being accretive to the bottom line profile as we think multi-year?
Kevin S. Wampler -- Chief Financial Officer
Sure, Matt. I'll start. So obviously the outlook we gave today, really the message there is that the freight is the change in the guidance for the most part, basically. I think the other thing you got there is a little bit of benefit in the back half from the shares we repurchased in Q2.
So I think otherwise, we look at the business as much like we did in Q2, all pieces outside of -- outside of freight. So, very stable and feel good about where we're at from that perspective, we've done a good job controlling our SG&A costs and everybody is very on top of those, and doing a good job. So we feel good about that. And so now it's about driving that topline and working through the supply chain issues that we documented in for everybody today. So I think a lot of good opportunity.
Your question as it relates to Dollar Tree Plus of being additive, yes, I mean that is the whole reason to do that. It was -- if it's not additive to the bottom line, we don't want to spend our resources necessarily doing that. So that is the expectation. And with the mix change from the initial version that was very consumable driven to the one that is now very discretionary driven, that obviously plays well, it's part of what we are known for, our customers embracing it, and it allows us to drive that bottom line.
And then obviously the topline does help us leverage some of the fixed costs.
Michael A. Witynski -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. And just to add or finalize that, we've seen nothing that's going to be a barrier against us to continue to drive the things that you said, top line growth and margin dollars in our stores.
Matthew Boss -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst
Great. Best of luck.
Operator
[Operator Instructions]. We can go ahead and take our next question from Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Kate McShane -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst
Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wondered with regards to the issues with freight and thank you for all the detail -- how are you balancing the prioritization of the cost of freight versus getting the inventory on the shelf? Is airfreight ever an option or something that you're using increasingly more? And how much were you able to make up by shifting to some of the domestic solutions you highlighted in your prepared comments?
Michael A. Witynski -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Kate, thanks for your question. It's a dollar price point, unfortunately air freight just is cost prohibitive, and there really isn't that much of it available out there. So our teams, our global supply team, we've got a sourcing team that's over there working with our merchants and working with the logistics team. Those three are working hard to pick the right source and prioritize the right product based on inventory needs, margin and seasonality.
And just as an example on the switching to different sources domestically, our teams solved this problem and we wanted to be right before back to school. So we very quickly shifted both the Family Dollar and Dollar Tree to procure products for the back-to-school season here domestically so that we could have it on the shelves and drive that important season for us.
Kate McShane -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst
Thank you.
Operator
Alright. [Technical Issues]. We can go ahead and take our next question from John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead.
John Heinbockel -- Guggenheim Partners -- Analyst
Hey, Mike, just wanted to start. Do you have any comment on -- by brand, right, you had [Phonetic] some color on cadence and consumable versus discretionary other than discretionary were strong. Do you have some color on that to see how the quarter unfolded?
Michael A. Witynski -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. So, geographically, we pretty much saw consistent across geographies other than weather events or, but normally it's -- they're both behaving similarly across the geography. What -- on the Family Dollar side, what we like -- what we're seeing is we are seeing consumable sale, our consumable market share continues to gain market share and it's -- the addressable market opportunity is so large. So we really focus on continuing to drive that market share and Family Dollar has been doing a great job continually quarter after quarter to have a year-over-year look and enhancing our market share on the consumable side. And then on the discretionary side, as you call out, remember, the team did such a great job with apparel and toys and home, seasonal and we are maintaining that two-year stack of high double-digit market share in the teens that is really helping our business.
John Heinbockel -- Guggenheim Partners -- Analyst
Okay. And then maybe just as a follow-up, when you think about Dollar Tree Plus, two issues there. So it sounds like it's probably is a penetration right, mid single-digit penetration of the baskets, right. So I think the basket rate is 2x with the Dollar Tree Plus item. Where do you see that going, right, when you think about adding more items to the mix or more SKU intensity? And then what's the bottleneck on -- I know you're going to do 1,500 next year. Can you do more and what's the bottleneck to doing more next year and '23?
Michael A. Witynski -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Well, we're really excited about doing the 1,500 because of the impact it has on a 6% sales lift. And I would say, as we -- the beautiful thing about this is, it gives us the flexibility to do what we need to grow our overall productivity of the store, and I'm referring to your do you grow the categories and/or assortment inside the multi price.
We will watch this, and over time, we will make great decisions to keep an eye on our overall margin dollars and topline sales and ebb and flow as we did with Dollar Tree product and categories. Just like we did with our Snack Zone, we use that to drive, so we've increased our assortment in there and space allocated to it. And then on our Crafter's Square, we did the same thing there. So I see this as the -- we keep doing the same ability to ebb and flow based on whatever our customers are responding to, and whatever is driving our topline and improving our margin dollars.
John Heinbockel -- Guggenheim Partners -- Analyst
Okay. Thank you.
Operator
Okay. We'll go ahead and take our next question from Joe Feldman with Telsey Advisory Group. Please go ahead.
Joe Feldman -- Telsey Advisory Group -- Analyst
Yeah. Hi guys. Thanks for taking the question. I guess on the freight side of things. I guess a big question is, what gives you confidence at this point that you've properly forecasted the impact of these increases? I guess, were we conservative or were you conservative with the forecast for the second half? You know, was it based just on what's happened to date? I guess, I'm trying to understand why we're not going to have another quarter like this where we hear another, well, we had to take numbers down again because freight was more expensive.
Kevin S. Wampler -- Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. Joe, this is Kevin. So obviously, as always, when we give a forecast, we use the best information we have, and what we know about our business, in this case what we know about the external factors, and the changes. And again it's very dynamic as anybody would tell you. And again, but I don't know that we can with 100% certainty say that it won't change. There could be another COVID outbreak, there could be a lot of different things it could affect it.
I just think you have to think about the fact that it is probably the most dynamic thing we may have ever seen as it relates to the marketplace. And -- but again, we always put it together with the idea of what do we know, how we're thinking about it, and do we -- and this is our best estimate at this point in time. And I'm hoping the sense that we have it tight this time, but there are never any guarantees in this type of thing.
Joe Feldman -- Telsey Advisory Group -- Analyst
Got it. And I guess a follow-up kind of related to it is, if you guys are assuming now, you know that your receipts will be more like 60% to 65% of what you had previously thought, I guess, how -- what gives you confidence that you'll get to the low-single digit comp guidance that you've given, because if you don't have the inventory, will you be able to -- how do you sell it?
Michael A. Witynski -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, let me -- let me -- that's a great question because I do want to bring clarity to that. The 60% to 65% is the contractual agreement that we have at the lower freight rate. We have a contract that's a 100%. We forecasted it first as well, they're going to at least meet 85% of that, and where I said they are not even meeting that, we think it's going to be 60% to 65%.
What that means is, the other 30% to 35% then will be at the market rate, at the higher rate, and all those rates are calculated into our freight that Kevin described going forward.
Joe Feldman -- Telsey Advisory Group -- Analyst
Got it. Thanks for clarifying that. Appreciate it, and best of luck with this quarter guys. Thank you.
Operator
And we'll go ahead and take our next question from Paul Lejuez with Citi. Please go ahead.
Paul Lejuez -- Citi Investment Research -- Analyst
Thanks guys. You made a comment about favorable product, merch margin and pricing that you're seeing, just curious what's driving that. Are you adjusting pack sizes, are you actually seeing declines in like product? And then on the Dollar Tree Plus store roll-out next year, how are you thinking about that geographically? Are you taking a regional approach, or are you going to look, will you open a bunch of Dollar Tree Plus stores in one region at a time, or are you looking to have a Dollar Tree Plus presence across a broad range of your markets? Thanks.
Michael A. Witynski -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. And your first question is, it was the question about our initial markup, the margin that we're able to get with all the inflationary pressures going on. Was that your question?
Paul Lejuez -- Citi Investment Research -- Analyst
Yeah, correct. And what's driving that?
Michael A. Witynski -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Yeah, thanks for the question because I want to brag about our merchants and the great job that they do. When you sell everything for $1, there are -- as you've read about, there is inflationary pressures, all over the board, and we've got a very experienced and knowledgeable team of merchants. And then, they're supported by a best-in-class global sourcing team that work really hard. And they're not just negotiating the end product you see on the shelf. Our merchants absolutely understand all the components that drive the cost of the product as well as the value that they need out in the marketplace to sell it.
So they know, the main commodity of the product, whether it's resin or cotton or paper or copper. So they go in very knowledgeable [Phonetic] on the cost and the components. They know the cost of a handle, or a lid, or a stitching or the weight of the paper. And as they build their product and understand that, that's how they come up where they know the margin they need, they know what the retail is at $1, and they know the sales that they have to obtain to drive the mix.
So on this most recent trip, in our July trip, they were just wrapping up a couple of weeks ago, we bought $1.8 billion in receipts, and they were able to obtain the margin, the initial markup and actually beat it by a little bit and it's higher than 2019. So that's why, with all the pressures they have, and with that dollar price point, our merchants are able to navigate and manage that, and look at all the components. So it's not only what's making that product, but it's the packaging, it's the plastic, it's how do we pack it in a case. They were very knowledgeable and negotiable, because pennies matter when you're selling things for $1, and I couldn't be more proud of the work that they do.
And when they read out and shared the products, and they -- you know, it gets down to the detail of how many petals around that rose, what's size of the petal, what size does the market have, does that value look great, and then they produce us great product at the cost that they need to hit the margins we want at the dollar price point.
And they did it over and over again. Because on this last trip, I think it was 70% to 73% of the items on that $1.8 billion buy had problems with inflation that things that we had to solve for, and they did it. They worked at it, they did it and the presentations were spectacular, and I'm so excited about the value and product we're having at $1. And I know it's hard to understand. That's why a lot of retailers can't do, but we do it. We've been doing it for 30 years and they just did it in July and that's why I said, if you think about the components of our margin, we have the initial markup that we're very excited about that I just described how we got to it.
You heard it from Kevin that our shrink is very favorable, our markdowns are in line and then you have freight. So if you take the freight and set it to a more normalized. We feel really good about the future of Dollar Tree.
And then to answer the second part of your -- the Dollar Tree Plus rollout, we're doing it probably regionally, and by distribution center. So as we put the product in the DC, then we're going to look at the available stores around that DC network, and then we'll grow it that way. So it's going to be probably a distribution center geographically driven. The good news is... [Speech Overlap].
Paul Lejuez -- Citi Investment Research -- Analyst
Which regions would be first stop [Phonetic] on that?
Michael A. Witynski -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Well, right now, we're in the -- we started out in the Southeast, and then -- or the Southwest, I'm sorry, and then I shared that we are moving into the mid-Atlantic and we're going to -- we'll be rolling out from there.
Paul Lejuez -- Citi Investment Research -- Analyst
Got it. Thank you. Good luck.
Operator
And we'll take our next question from Brad Thomas with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Brad Thomas -- KeyBanc Capital Markets -- Analyst
Hi. Thanks, good morning. Wanted to ask a question about the third quarter, first of all, your guidance implies total sales and comps to accelerate for 3Q, and we're just curious if that's something that you're seeing so far to date. What gives you confidence in that, and if you're seeing that in both banners.
Michael A. Witynski -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, you're right. We gave -- we're back to giving guidance for the first time in well over a year, and we guided low single digits at the $6.40 billion to $6.52 billion. And I can share that both banners are positive comps now, and they're aligned with the guidance that we've given.
Brad Thomas -- KeyBanc Capital Markets -- Analyst
Really helpful. And then a quick follow-up on the Dollar Tree Plus financial commentary that you shared today, very encouraging. As we think about that flow through, should we think about the 6% sales lift and the 6% gross profit lift as adding close to that to total operating margin for the Dollar Tree banner? How should we think about the flow-through of those gross profit dollars?
Michael A. Witynski -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. And I think that's exactly, it's pretty in line with the other data point we gave, which was basically a 13% lift in the -- increase in contribution. So yes, it's somewhat additive there, 6% and the 6% kind of gets you to that same point.
Brad Thomas -- KeyBanc Capital Markets -- Analyst
Very helpful. Thank you so much.
Operator
All right. We'll go ahead and take our next question from Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett. Please go ahead, Chuck.
Chuck Grom -- Gordon Haskett Research -- Analyst
Hey, thanks a lot. You know, guys, when you look at the Tree business, and I know you just said that August was a little bit better, but when you think about the backdrop and all the money that's flowing out there, and only delivering a flat comp, I guess I'm curious when you dissect why that is, I guess how would you unpack it for us?
Michael A. Witynski -- President and Chief Executive Officer
So in this, are you referring to look forward or the.. [Speech Overlap]
Chuck Grom -- Gordon Haskett Research -- Analyst
Well, just for the second quarter [Speech Overlap] -- just the second quarter and the flat comp given on stimulus and child tax credit money that's out there.
Michael A. Witynski -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Well, Family Dollar response to stimulus dollar is a lot better than the Dollar Tree comp. And I've already shared the comments on the -- we think that there is still some trip consolidation, there wasn't any -- there is no big holidays. You saw and read about everybody went on vacation, and then the Delta variant kind of hit toward the end of the quarter and kind of slowed things down a little bit.
So I think it's more of that. I'm really excited about looking forward with what we have ahead of us. But I think you bring up a great point on the opportunity ahead with the SNAP benefits out there. Our enterprise has increased the SNAP benefits in our -- as a retailer, by almost double since 2019. And why that's important is, right now as an enterprise, we are the sixth largest SNAP retailer. And that's really important to us and we're just behind Walmart, Kroger, Ahold and Albertsons. So we are the number one largest retailer of SNAP benefits in the Dollar channel.
And think about the benefits, as you know, they announced that they're going to increase them in October significantly. And in Family Dollar what we really like about that is, we've doubled it in since 2019 inside Family Dollar. But then inside that basket of SNAP, 42% of that customer buys a discretionary item.
So if you think about all the work we've done on the discretionary side, in that mix, and looking forward and the basket, we think there is a big upside for us when the SNAP benefits continue to increase in October, and then our capabilities that the merchants have been on the discretionary side and our customer willing to add that to the basket, when they're in their store.
Chuck Grom -- Gordon Haskett Research -- Analyst
That's great. And my second question is on the Combo stores, they look great. And, you know, the movement [Phonetic] to 85% of the new Family Dollars in that format is pretty exciting. I'm curious what you do with the existing Family Dollar stores. Is there an opportunity to remodel some of them to convert in certain markets, I guess, how does that -- how does that play out?
Michael A. Witynski -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Well, absolutely. So there's two things. I mean, we also -- we're not slowing down. We've got 800 H2 renovations that we're going to continue to do, and we like the results and the lift we're getting on those. And then to your point in those 3,000 towns that we've identified, we're attacking the new ones, but we're also in a 1,000 of them already.
So our team -- our real estate team is diligently going through there, how long is that lease, can we expand it where we're at, can we relocate it, or is it big enough already. So those are the things that we're going through on that 1,000 existing of the 3,000 opportunity. So we're -- we've got a team effort going against both of those new, and then the relocated and then our existing will be focused on the H2 renovations.
Chuck Grom -- Gordon Haskett Research -- Analyst
Okay, great. Thanks a lot.
Operator
All right. Unfortunately, we are getting close to the end of the call, and only have time for one more question. We will take our last question from Michael Lasser with UBS. Please go ahead.
Michael Lasser -- UBS -- Analyst
Good morning. Thanks a lot -- Good morning, thanks a lot for taking my question. Dollar Tree comp negative at a time when many other retailers are really experiencing robust trends. This comes on the heels of challenges from tariffs, now transportation costs and Family Dollar issues before that.
So, is it just too difficult to manage this business in an environment where inflation is going to be structurally higher than it's been, and all of this is translating to your earnings expectation for 2021 being on par with where your earnings were in 2018. So at what point do you think you're going to be able to be in a position to start to resume growth in earnings that will be more consistent with what the market is accustomed to from Dollar Tree in the past.
Michael A. Witynski -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. I can't reiterate more about my confidence in Dollar Tree's ability to grow and our ability to manage through these inflationary times. You set this freight aside, and we would be delivering exactly what you're describing. And I'm excited about the market opportunity out there. And the beautiful thing is as we've got these strategic initiatives that will grow and well into the future. And more importantly with everything you described, we still got a strong balance sheet. We make a lot of cash flow and with our cash flow, we have the ability to keep growing this Company, growing the infrastructure of the Company and buying back shares to drive total shareholder wealth.
So I like our opportunity going forward for both Dollar Tree and Family Dollar.
Michael Lasser -- UBS -- Analyst
Okay. Mike, the biggest source of push back we've gotten from folks today is just on the core Dollar Tree comp being negative when everyone else is seeing robust trends. Putting aside Dollar Tree and putting aside some of the questions around traffic, what gives you the confidence that you can see the core of that business continue to improve, independent of what's going to happen in the external environment? And as a quick follow-up, Kevin, could you walk us through the path for how freight costs are going to unfold beyond this year? Your comments were, it's not going to see relief in fiscal '22. You're saying if you add this back, you could earn close to $7. So when is it realistic for the market to expect you to earn this $7 target?
Michael A. Witynski -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, I couldn't -- I can't reiterate enough how confident I am in the Dollar Tree format, especially with the Dollar Tree Plus initiative that we're going to be driving to 5,000 stores in just a short few years. And then what I just described on what our merchants are able to do with a great value and the dollar price point, and keep in mind, this dollar price point is going to be more important than ever as other retailers are driving their comps by raising prices. That dollar price point is going to look good and I'm confident going into the back half, with our seasons, with our product that we have and what our merchants are delivering, we're going to continue to be able to drive this organization forward.
Kevin S. Wampler -- Chief Financial Officer
And Michael, as to your second part of your question as it relates to the freight. So obviously, the marketplace in general, there is an expectation that it does not get better necessarily in the first half. And the other piece of what you have to remember is costs -- some of the costs that we'll incur this year in freight at the end of the year are attached to those goods that then gets sold in the next year.
So, certain amount of freight gets capitalized in the inventory as it comes in. So as your inventory turns, it's when you burn that off. So anything along the lines that we've been incurring will fall -- there is a piece of that, that falls into next year. So that's how you have to remember that. As far as $7, listen, obviously we know -- we know today, a lot of things are going to change in the next six months. And we'll know more then, and when we give guidance in March of 2022 for the year we'll again be in a point where we'll put our best foot forward on what we know at that point in time.
So beyond that, it's, there is nothing to speculate at this point.

Aug 26 (Reuters) - Wall Street fell on Thursday on fears of a faster tapering of the Federal Reserve's bond purchase program, although gains in banks and some strong earnings reports helped cap losses.
All three major U.S. indexes had declined sharply in early trading after a bomb blast in Afghanistan's capital city of Kabul briefly rattled sentiment.
""This short-term noise in Kabul is certainly not welcome news, but I think the market can look through that and it really wants to see what the Fed has to say tomorrow,"" said Thomas Hayes, managing member at Great Hill Capital in New York.

In separate interviews on Thursday, St. Louis Federal Reserve president James Bullard and Kansas City Fed president Esther George and Dallas Fed president Robert Kaplan downplayed the impact of the Delta variant and urged the central bank to begin paring bond purchases they feel have become ineffective.

""The Fed recognizes that having this level of liquidity in the marketplace is causing inflation and it's not needed anymore to this degree due to the fact that the economy is continuing to rebound and reopen,"" said Brian Vendig, president, MJP Wealth Advisors in Westport, Connecticut.

U.S. stocks have hit a series of all-time closing highs in the past few sessions, driven by a stronger-than-expected earnings season and positive news about COVID-19 vaccinations.
However, strategists have projected the benchmark S&P 500 .SPX will end the year essentially unchanged from the current levels at 4,500 points as the economic recovery and earnings growth lose momentum.
Data showed the U.S. economy grew a bit faster than initially thought in the second quarter, in a second estimate of gross domestic product growth, while weekly jobless claims increased 4,000 to a seasonally adjusted 353,000 for the week ended Aug. 21.
At 12:39 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI was down 53.39 points, or 0.15%, at 35,352.11 and the S&P 500 .SPX was down 10.14 points, or 0.23%, at 4,486.05, supported by a 4.6% jump in the shares of Salesforce.com Inc CRM.N following upbeat results.
The Nasdaq Composite .IXIC was down 22.96 points, or 0.15%, at 15,018.90.
Ten of the 11 major S&P sectors declined, while real estate .SPLRCR shares bucked the trend to edge higher.
Discount retailers Dollar General Corp DG.N and Dollar Tree Inc DLTR.O slipped 4% and 10.8%, respectively, after they warned of a profit hit from higher transportation costs.
NetApp Inc NTAP.O added 5.6% as brokerages raised their price targets for the cloud data services provider's stock following an upbeat first-quarter result and a better-than-expected 2022 earnings outlook.
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 2.12-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and by a 1.39-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.
The S&P index recorded 24 new 52-week highs and 2 new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 71 new highs and 33 new lows.

Dollar Tree (DLTR, -12.1%) dropped after it reported disappointing Q2 revenues and cut full-year profit estimates to below analysts' expectations. Rival Dollar General's (DG, -3.8%) 2021 earnings forecast also came in under the bar. Global design software firm Autodesk (ADSK, -9.4%) provided a similar letdown as its third-quarter profit guidance missed the mark.

Aug 26 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks were set to slip from their record perch on Thursday as mixed earnings reports and economic data kept investors on edge ahead of the Federal Reserve's policy summit.
Futures for the main indexes dipped after St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said he was skeptical about inflation moderating in 2022 and that the central bank wants to complete tapering its bond purchases by end of first quarter next year.
Fed chief Jerome Powell's speech at the Jackson Hole economic symposium on Friday will be closely watched for more clues on the timing of the wind-down of pandemic-era stimulus.
""The market is very focused on what's going to be said about tapering and you partner that with it being late August, it's going to be a relatively quiet trading session,"" said Robert Pavlik, senior portfolio manager at Dakota Wealth in Fairfield, Connecticut.
""(Earlier) it seemed very conceivable that the Fed could announce some tapering, but now I'm not so sure.""
Earlier in the day, the Bank of Korea raised its policy rate off a record low on Thursday, becoming the first central bank of a major Asian economy to do so.
U.S. stocks have hit a series of all-time closing highs in the past few sessions, driven by a much stronger-than-expected earnings season and positive news about COVID-19 vaccinations.
However, strategists have projected the benchmark S&P 500 .SPX to end the year at 4,500 points, essentially unchanged, expecting the economic recovery as well as earnings growth to lose momentum amid a spike in coronavirus cases and the tapering moves from the Fed.
Data showed the U.S. economy grew a bit faster than initially thought in the second quarter, in a second estimate of GDP growth, while weekly jobless claims increased 4,000 to a seasonally adjusted 353,000 for the week ended Aug. 21.
At 8:58 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis 1YMcv1 were up 30 points, or 0.08%, S&P 500 e-minis EScv1 were down 5 points, or 0.11%, and Nasdaq 100 e-minis NQcv1 were down 41.5 points, or 0.27%.

(DLTR) reported a year-over-year increase of 11.8% in its second quarter earnings per share. However, the company reduced its fiscal 2021 earnings guidance due to additional freight costs since the previous guidance.
Dollar General Corp. (DG) recorded a year-on-year decline of 13.8% in its second quarter earnings per share. Same-store sales were down 4.7%, for the quarter. The company updated its fiscal 2021 financial guidance despite an expected increase in transportation and distribution costs for the remainder of fiscal 2021.
Dollar Tree reported that its second-quarter earnings per share increased 11.8% to $1.23, from $1.10, last year. On average, 23 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected the company to report profit per share of $1.01, for the quarter. Analysts' estimates typically exclude special items. Net income increased to $282.4 million from $261.5 million, last year.
Dollar Tree reported that consolidated net sales increased 1.0% to $6.34 billion from $6.28 billion. Analysts expected revenue of $6.44 billion, for the quarter. Enterprise same-store sales decreased 1.2% on a constant currency basis, or 1.1% when adjusted to include the impact of Canadian currency fluctuations.
For fiscal 2021, Dollar Tree now expects consolidated net sales to range from $26.19 billion to $26.44 billion, based on a low single-digit increase in same-store sales and 3.4% square footage growth. The company now estimates earnings per share will range from $5.40 to $5.60. Previously, the company projected fiscal 2021 earnings per share in a range of $5.80 and $6.05. Analysts expect the company to report profit per share of $5.99 on revenue of $26.40 billion.
Freight costs for fiscal 2021 are now expected to be $1.50 to $1.60 per share higher than fiscal 2020. The updated outlook includes $0.60 to $0.65 per share, of additional freight costs since the prior guidance. The company's previous freight outlook assumed that its regular ocean carriers would fulfill only 85% of their contractual commitments and also assumed higher spot market rates. However, Dollar Tree now projects that its regular carriers will fulfill only 60-65% of their commitments. Also, the spot market rates for ocean freight from China have increased more than 20%.
For the third quarter, Dollar Tree estimates consolidated net sales will range from $6.40 billion to $6.52 billion, based on a low single-digit increase in same-store sales for the combined enterprise. Earnings per share are estimated to be in the range of $0.88 to $0.98. Analysts expect the company to report profit per share of $1.26 on revenue of $6.43 billion.
Shares of Dollar Tree were down 7% in pre-market trade on Thursday.
Dollar General Corp. reported that its second-quarter earnings per share decreased 13.8% to $2.69 from $3.12, last year.

Net sales decreased 0.4% to $8.65 billion. Analysts expected revenue of $8.59 billion, for the quarter.
For fiscal 2021, Dollar General now expects earnings per share in the range of $9.60 to $10.20, compared to previous expectation in the range of $9.50 to $10.20. Analysts expect the company to report profit per share of $10.22. Net sales growth is projected in a range of 0.5% to 1.5%; compared to prior expectation of a 1% decline to an increase of 1%. The company now targets same-store sales decline of 3.5% to 2.5%, compared to its prior expectation of a decline of 5% to 3%. Share repurchases are projected to be approximately $2.4 billion; compared to prior guidance of approximately $2.2 billion.

The Bank of Korea raised its policy rate off a record low on Thursday - the first central bank of a major Asian economy to do so - in a transition away from pandemic-era stimulus.
