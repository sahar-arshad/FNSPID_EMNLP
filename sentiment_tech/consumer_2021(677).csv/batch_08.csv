2021-05-19 00:00:00+00:00,First Week of DLTR August 20th Options Trading,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/first-week-of-dltr-august-20th-options-trading-2021-05-19,,,"Investors in Dollar Tree Inc (Symbol: DLTR) saw new options begin trading this week, for the August 20th expiration. One of the key inputs that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 93 days until expiration the newly trading contracts represent a potential opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the DLTR options chain for the new August 20th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $105.00 strike price has a current bid of $4.55. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $105.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $100.45 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of DLTR, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $108.38/share today.
Because the $105.00 strike represents an approximate 3% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 61%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 4.33% return on the cash commitment, or 17.01% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Dollar Tree Inc, and highlighting in green where the $105.00 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $110.00 strike price has a current bid of $5.50. If an investor was to purchase shares of DLTR stock at the current price level of $108.38/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $110.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 6.57% if the stock gets called away at the August 20th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if DLTR shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Dollar Tree Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing DLTR's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $110.00 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $110.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 51%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 5.07% boost of extra return to the investor, or 19.92% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.
The implied volatility in the put contract example, as well as the call contract example, are both approximately 31%.
Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $108.38) to be 31%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

2021-05-13 00:00:00+00:00,Where Will Dollar Tree Be in 5 Years?,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/where-will-dollar-tree-be-in-5-years-2021-05-13,,,"Dollar Tree (NASDAQ: DLTR) is one of the few brick-and-mortar retailers that expanded even as the ""retail apocalypse"" wiped out many other businesses. The over-expansion of retail stores and the rise of online marketplaces sparked that secular decline, which was then exacerbated by the financial crisis and recent pandemic.
Dollar Tree's stock has advanced more than 40% over the past five years. Its annual revenue rose from $15.5 billion in 2015 to $25.5 billion in 2020, while its total number of Dollar Tree, Dollar Tree Canada, and Family Dollar stores increased from 13,851 to 15,685.

Dollar Tree remained resilient for two reasons. First, its stores were usually located in lower-income neighborhoods, and usually closer to shoppers than superstores like Walmart and Target.
Second, it consistently sold cheaper products than those retailers and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN). Dollar Tree still sells most of its products for $1, while Family Dollar (which it acquired in 2015) sells slightly more expensive products. Both banners are resistant to recessions, which often cause more shoppers to flock toward discount retailers.
Dollar Tree has been a stable investment, but it's significantly underperformed the S&P 500 and its rival Dollar General (NYSE: DG) over the past five years. Let's see why that happened, and whether or not Dollar Tree can catch up within the next five years.
What happened over the past five years?
Dollar Tree's biggest challenge over the past few years has been its integration of Family Dollar. Family Dollar was already struggling to keep pace with Walmart, Target, and Amazon at the time of its acquisition, and those challenges continued under Dollar Tree's watch.
However, Dollar Tree gradually turned around Family Dollar by renovating its stores, selling alcoholic beverages, and adding $1 Dollar Tree sections to its stores. It also right-sized the entire chain by closing over 400 weaker locations and rebranding 200 of them as Dollar Tree stores.
That turnaround was slow, but Family Dollar's same-store sales growth accelerated over the past two years. The pandemic, which caused more shoppers to stock up on household essentials, also generated significant tailwinds for Family Dollar's remaining stores last year.

Data source: Dollar Tree.
Dollar General, which operates most of its stores in rural areas, didn't struggle with any acquisition indigestion issues, and faced fewer local competitors than Family Dollar. That's why Dollar General has generated much stronger same-store sales growth than Dollar Tree over the past few years.
What are Dollar Tree's plans for the future?
Dollar Tree recently partnered with Instacart to provide same-day delivery for Family Dollar shoppers, and started testing out sales of fresh and frozen groceries at select Family Dollar locations.
It completed the rollout of its ""Crafter's Square"" for arts and crafts supplies at all of its Dollar Tree locations in January. It's also rolling out Dollar Tree Plus, which sells products for $3 to $5, at up to 500 of its stores this year to gauge demand for slightly pricier goods at its namesake banner.
Dollar Tree also consolidated the support centers for both banners into one campus to streamline its operations, and it's been testing out Dollar Tree/Family Dollar combination stores to serve small towns. Those combo stores, which have been generating about 20% same-store sales growth, could finally help Dollar Tree challenge Dollar General.
Dollar Tree plans to open 600 new stores (including 400 Dollar Tree and 200 Family Dollar locations) and renovate 1,250 Family Dollar stores in fiscal 2021. The new Family Dollar locations will include its new combo stores and its ""H2"" stores -- which offer a wider range of merchandise, a Dollar Tree $1 section, and more freezers and coolers than its older stores.
Dollar Tree didn't provide any detailed guidance for the full year, but analysts expect its revenue and earnings to rise 3% and 9%, respectively. They also expect its growth to accelerate slightly in fiscal 2022 as its revenue and earnings increase 5% and 12%, respectively.
But will Dollar Tree outperform the market?
Based on those estimates, Dollar Tree's stock looks cheap at 16 times forward earnings. The company finally seems to be on the right track after fixing Family Dollar, and it's constantly testing out new ways to refresh its brand and reach more shoppers. However, it still faces unpredictable headwinds like tariffs and Amazon's expansion of its ""$10 and under"" section.
Therefore, I believe Dollar Tree's stock will head higher over the next five years, but I'm not confident it will beat the market or Dollar General. Many investors might stick with Dollar General as their top dollar store play, and dollar stores still often underperform the broader market during an economic recovery -- which will likely happen after the pandemic finally ends.

2021-04-14 00:00:00+00:00,"Estimating The Intrinsic Value Of Dollar Tree, Inc. (NASDAQ:DLTR)",DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/estimating-the-intrinsic-value-of-dollar-tree-inc.-nasdaq%3Adltr-2021-04-14,,,"Does the April share price for Dollar Tree, Inc. (NASDAQ:DLTR) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.
We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model.
The model
We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.
Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:
10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate
2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030
Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$1.20b US$1.09b US$1.28b US$1.35b US$1.50b US$1.64b US$1.74b US$1.82b US$1.89b US$1.96b
Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x10 Analyst x7 Analyst x7 Analyst x2 Analyst x2 Analyst x2 Est @ 6.07% Est @ 4.86% Est @ 4.02% Est @ 3.42%
Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.4% US$1.1k US$946 US$1.0k US$1.0k US$1.1k US$1.1k US$1.1k US$1.0k US$999 US$962
(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)
Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$10b
After calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.0%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.4%.
Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2030 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$2.0b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (7.4%– 2.0%) = US$38b
Present Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$38b÷ ( 1 + 7.4%)10= US$18b
The total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$29b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$118, the company appears about fair value at a 4.4% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.
NasdaqGS:DLTR Discounted Cash Flow April 14th 2021
The assumptions
We would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Dollar Tree as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.4%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.018. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.
Moving On:
Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. For Dollar Tree, there are three additional items you should consider:
Risks: Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk. We've identified 2 warning signs with Dollar Tree , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.

Dollar Tree has two chains: its namesake stores and Family Dollar. The Dollar Tree brand sells most items for $1 or less. Meanwhile, Family Dollar, which the company acquired in 2015, has price points ranging from $1 to $10.
Management is experimenting with higher prices at the Dollar Tree chain, though. Last year, it tested offerings at $3 and $5 under its Dollar Tree Plus concept. Based on what the company learned, it expanded the testing to 500 stores (out of about 7,800 total) this year and started offering combination stores.
Last year, adjusted same-store sales (also called comps) increased by 6%. While Dollar Tree's comps rose by 2.2%, its struggling Family Dollar franchise turned things around with a 10.5% increase.
People spending more money drove the comps increase, even as fewer people frequented the stores. Of course, with the pandemic restricting people's activity, 2020 was anything but a typical year.
Can it last?
Management implemented several initiatives designed to improve Family Dollar's sales, including changing the offerings and devoting more space to frozen goods.
On the bright side, management notes that renovated stores have produced 10% higher sales. Still, it also stated that COVID-19 helped boost sales at the chain, making it difficult to judge the success of its plan right now.
A competitive marketplace
Aside from other exclusive discount stores, like Dollar General, Dollar Tree competes with a bevy of major retailers. This includes Walmart, which has perfected its low-price offerings, and other retailers that have a section devoted to $1 merchandise.
Last year, the Family Dollar unit entered into an arrangement with delivery service Instacart that allows online shopping. A couple of months ago, management expanded this to over 6,000 stores out of the nearly 7,900 total. An increased omnichannel presence is important to remain competitive with the likes of Walmart, but these large chains have broad offerings, making it a tough battle.
So, with all credit due to management for launching initiatives to improve the chain's standing, this is still a very competitive marketplace. Before committing your hard-earned money, it is better to wait and see how the initiatives pan out as people keep receiving vaccinations and the retail landscape begins to return to some semblance of normalcy.

When the Nasdaq composite index peaked in February, investors who bid on the dip likely lost money. Confidence in the technology is waning. Selling follows after most sharp rallies, while the index struggles in building an uptrend.
The market is shifting away from the stay-at-home pandemic trade and seeking traditionally valued stocks on the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Valuations are another headwind for the sector that rewarded investors with gains above 100% or more in the last year, in some cases.
Investors cannot time the dip, so buying the best stocks on the Nasdaq is the next best thing to do.
7 Monthly Dividend Stocks That Pay the Bills
The seven best stocks on the exchange and listed in alphabetical order are:
Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO)
DocuSign (NASDAQ:DOCU)
Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR)
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB)
Intel (NASDAQ:INTC)
Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)
Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:REGN)
List sorted by overall score

In the table, Regeneron scores the best overall and on quality. On quality, every stock scores an 82/100 or above except for DocuSign. DocuSign makes up for the lower quality score with a strong valuation ratings score of 72/100.
Facebook sticks out for having a perfect 100/100 on its growth score.
The scores will change for the better as these firms increase profits and revenue in 2021.
Nasdaq Stocks: Cisco Systems (CSCO)

Cisco Systems bottomed in November 2020 at below $36. CSCO stock staged a rebound after it posted strong quarterly earnings. On March 1, it announced the completion of its Acacia Communications acquisition. Cisco paid $4.5 billion for the company. Chief Executive Officer Chuck Robbins said Acacia will help it meet the fast-growing demand for data. He said, “our Internet for the Future strategy puts Acacia’s high-speed coherent optics technologies front and center as we work to empower webscale companies, service providers, and data center operators.”
In the second quarter, Cisco posted a product order growth of 1% year-on-year. GAAP earnings per share fell 12% YOY to 60 cents. Although revenue did not change at $12 billion in Q2, it forecast Q3 revenue growing 3.5% to 5.5% YOY. EPS will be in the range of 64 to 69 cents.
Strong DevOps buyers, IoT, and the Meraki technology platform are growth drivers for Cisco.
DocuSign (DOCU)

After failing to break out at above $250 since the start of the year, DocuSign is trading in a holding pattern. The EPS beat in the fourth quarter failed to lift DOCU stock.
In Q4, DocuSign posted EPS of 37 cents beating consensus estimates by 15 cents. Revenue grew by an impressive 56.7% at $430.9 million. The company forecast revenue of $1.96 billion to $1.97 billion. In the months ahead, as companies bring workers back to the physical office, contracts will get digitized. They will need a solution offered from DocuSign instead of going back to paper.
7 Monthly Dividend Stocks That Pay the Bills
After the trifecta again of beating estimates on earnings, revenue, and offering guidance that exceeds expectations, DocuSign is the best stock on the Nasdaq to watch.
DocuSign is worth over $200 if its revenue growth continues over the next five years.

In the model, readers may assume an EBITDA multiple of around 42 times. This would reflect the strong revenue growth ahead, as companies embrace digitization for contract management.
Readers may assign a lower discount rate if they are confident that the company will continue beating expectations.
 Dollar Tree (DLTR)

Like DocuSign, discount store Dollar Tree posted strong fourth-quarter results. It earned $2.13 a share, up 310% YOY. Investors cannot go wrong buying DLTR stock.
Net sales rose by 7.2% to $6.77 billion. In the all-important same-store sales metric, Family Dollar’s 8.1% increase suggests continued strength ahead. Dollar Tree’s Family Dollar partnered nationally with Instacart. This resulted in continued sales momentum at its stores. Furthermore, the company introduced a new “combination store” format that performed very well.
During fiscal 2020, it tested this format at its approximately 50 stores in rural and small-town communities. The strong results suggest that the company will expand the format this year. In Q4, the company bought back 1.83 million shares for $200 million. With $2.4 billion in its share repurchase authorization, shareholders are getting the maximum return from their investment.
Nasdaq Stocks: Facebook (FB)

Apple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) upcoming privacy changes are an existential threat to Facebook. But CEO Mark Zukerberg said that the changes will put Facebook’s commerce products in a stronger position. Apple is giving users direct control on its privacy. So when Apple’s iOS 14 gives them privacy options, users could limit the way Facebook tracks them.
Giving limited customer data to customers may end up hurting advertisers. Since advertisers have few other platforms besides Facebook, ad sales should not change.
To expand its addressable market, Facebook launched Instagram Lite to 170 countries. The growing user base will solidify the experience-sharing site’s social networking market share.
7 Monthly Dividend Stocks That Pay the Bills
In the fourth quarter, Facebook said it would buy back $25 billion in shares. This is in addition to its $34 billion authorization. The continued site usage and 33% revenue growth assures that investors are getting the best returns by holding FB stock.
Intel (INTC)

Intel’s Rocket Lake processor launch keeps the mature chip giant in the game. The company says the 11th generation Intel core offers “unmatched overclocking, game performance.”
The i9-11900K chip is nothing short of impressive. It offers speeds of up to 5.3GHz, which should appeal to power users and PC gamers. The chip is 19% faster than previous generation architectures. The integrated graphics architecture performance is an equally notable achievement. Business users who buy CPUs want on-board graphics support to lower the cost over ownership. On the press release, Intel said that the UHD graphics matter “because games and most applications continue to depend on high-frequency cores to drive high frame rates and low latency.”
For a few quarters, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) enjoyed a sizable technical lead over Intel. Rocket Lake is an answer to AMD’s Ryzen 5000 series chip. Still, AMD offers better performance at the price paid. But with limited supplies from the latest Ryzen CPU, Intel has a chance to accelerate sales in 2021.
Microsoft (MSFT)

Software giant Microsoft grew its addressable market when it received the European Union’s approval for the Bethesda acquisition. Acquiring ZeniMax Media, the parent of Bethesda Softworks, gives Microsoft 23 game studios.
Titles like Doom and Fallout have growing revenue potential as the gaming sector remains hot. Consumers have few other major sources of entertainment during and after the pandemic. Microsoft will not only increase its cash flow from its Office365, SQL Server, and Windows sales but will get a lift from games.
In early March, hackers took advantage of a flaw in Microsoft’s email software. The hack affected tens of thousands of organizations in Asia and Europe. Despite the negative news, MSFT stock did not react at all. Shares traded steadily in the $230 to $240 range for the month.

Nasdaq Stocks: Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN)

After announcing positive topline data for its novel coronavirus antibody, Regeneron has yet to attract investors. REGN stock is taking a back seat to Covid-19 vaccine suppliers instead.
The drug manufacturer is posting billions in revenue for its blockbuster drug, Dupixent. On top of that, markets are ignoring the potential of its treatment for Covid-19 patients. On March 23, Regeneron reported the results of its Phase 3 trial. The antibody cocktail reduced hospitalization or death by 70% for non-hospitalized Covid-19 patients. It also shorted the duration of symptoms by four days.
Regeneron said that doses in the 1,200 mg to 8,000 mg range had similar efficacy. This suggests that if the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approves REGEN-COV, it will have a 1,200 mg dose level. Chief Scientific Officer Dr. George D. Yancopoulos said, “We will discuss the new data with regulatory authorities and request that the 1,200 mg dose be rapidly added to the U.S. Emergency Use Authorization, in order for the anticipated REGEN-COV supply to be available to treat even more patients.”
If approved, Regeneron will become one of the best stocks on the Nasdaq to hold.

2021-03-27 00:00:00+00:00,Boost Your Passive Income With Monthly Dividend Checks From These 3 Stocks,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/boost-your-passive-income-with-monthly-dividend-checks-from-these-3-stocks-2021-03-27,,,"Dividends are usually paid quarterly or semiannually, but let's face it: Your bills keep rolling in every month. Fortunately, there are a handful of companies that make monthly dividend payments.
If you're looking for stocks that provide monthly income, real estate investment trusts, or REITs, are a good place to start. Under SEC rules, they're required to pay 90% of their taxable incomes as dividends each year. Realty Income (NYSE: O), LTC Properties (NYSE: LTC), and STAG Industrial (NYSE: STAG) are three commercial REITs with strong track records of paying monthly dividends.
Image source: Getty Images.
1. Realty Income
Realty Income has trademarked the nickname ""The Monthly Dividend Company."" Its latest monthly dividend was $0.235, which amounts to a current yield of 4.45%.
Its portfolio consists mostly of triple-net, or NNN, leases, which mean the tenant is responsible for property taxes, maintenance, and insurance. That's understandably desirable from a landlord's perspective.
Although retail REITs were hit hard by the pandemic, Realty Income's portfolio has generally fared well. In the fourth quarter of 2020, it collected 93.6% of rents due, with the theater industry accounting for 80% of uncollected rents.
Many of its tenants are essential businesses that remained open throughout shutdowns and are less likely to close brick-and-mortar locations even as e-commerce accelerates. Its five largest tenants are Walgreens (NASDAQ: WBA), 7-Eleven, Dollar General (NYSE: DG), FedEx (NYSE: FDX), and Dollar Tree (NASDAQ: DLTR), including Family Dollar locations.
What's especially appealing about this retail REIT isn't just its history of monthly dividend payments -- 608 consecutive months and counting as of March 2021. The company has also increased its dividend payment every year since going public in 1994. Last year, it became a Dividend Aristocrat -- an elite status awarded to companies in the S&P 500 index with at least 25 years of consecutive annual increases.
2. LTC Properties
LTC Properties is a healthcare REIT with 184 properties, most of which are assisted living and skilled nursing facilities with triple-net leases.
The pandemic has obviously been brutal for the types of senior-care properties in the company's portfolio. The heavy toll of COVID-19 led to a drop in hospital referrals. Families have also been hesitant to move loved ones into senior care facilities. According to an analysis by CliftonLarsonAllen, skilled nursing facility occupancy was below 80% in all 48 continental states at the start of 2021.
However, LTC Properties has fared decently since it only leases the properties but doesn't actually operate the facilities. Management reported that 98% of rents were collected as due in Q4.
In the past five years, LTC Properties shares have dropped nearly 4%. By comparison, the S&P 500 index has risen 95% over the same period.
However, LTC's monthly dividend of $0.19 per share translates to a yield of 5.37%, making it a decent play for those seeking reliable income, considering that the current S&P 500 yield is below 1.5%. Plus, the company could benefit from an aging population that will drive higher demand for senior living in the years to come.
3. STAG Industrial
STAG Industrial owns 492 properties, mostly in the warehouse and industrial spaces. These tend to be stable even during downturns and are expected to be in greater demand as more shopping shifts to e-commerce.
With about 40% of its portfolio involved in e-commerce, STAG has held up well during the pandemic. Management reported that in Q4, 99.6% of rents were collected as billed.
The company's portfolio is appealing not just for its stability, but also for its diversification. Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) is its largest tenant, though it accounts for less than 4% of annual base rent (ABR). STAG's top 20 tenants make up less than 20% of ABR.
Don't expect huge gains out of STAG. However, its $0.121 monthly dividend gives you an annual yield of 4.37%. If you're looking for stable monthly income, STAG's dividend is a pretty safe bet.

2021-03-16 00:00:00+00:00,Do Dollar Tree's Combo Stores Spell the End of the Dollar Store Concept?,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/do-dollar-trees-combo-stores-spell-the-end-of-the-dollar-store-concept-2021-03-16,,,"Dollar Tree (NASDAQ: DLTR) was for a long time the only dollar store chain that actually only sold items for a dollar. It was only after acquiring the Family Dollar chain that the deep discounter experimented with putting higher-priced items in an aisle or two.
There were some very good reasons for Dollar Tree to add slightly higher-priced products to its shelves, such as bringing in more brand name goods and offering better value to its customers for only a little extra.
Image source: Dollar Tree.
Now, though, it's breaking down the barriers even more between the two concepts by building combination stores that house both Dollar Tree and Family Dollar under one roof, blurring the line completely between the chains. It might have two signs out front, but there's just one store inside.
It might just signal the end of the true dollar store concept, but both consumers and investors will be better off for it.
Pennies on the dollar
It was only a matter of time before Dollar Tree ""broke the buck."" Inflation alone would limit the products the discounter could sell and still offer quality to consumers, and by just inching up the price point -- to $2, $3, or $5 per item -- it would open up more opportunity for the retailer.
Both Family Dollar and rival Dollar General (NYSE: DG) sell most of their goods under $10 each, and around $5 is probably the sweet spot for both. Yet you can find a number of products that are well above that threshold too.
So even though Dollar Tree introduced a number of items that were slightly above the $1 limit in an initiative it called Dollar Tree Plus!, it remains the deepest value chain of the three national outlets. As noted earlier, it allows Dollar Tree to increase the number of name brands, the size of products sold, the value, and to bring in new items too.
It's continuing to expand on the program, expanding it from 120 stores to 500 stores this year, but by essentially also opening up a Family Dollar store inside a Dollar Tree chain, it blows out the whole concept, and probably for the better.
All in the family
After winning the bidding war for Family Dollar over Dollar General, paying $8.5 billion in 2015 for a chain that was broken, Dollar Tree languished trying to get the business functional again. The drag was so great that activist investor Starboard Value began agitating for the retailer to sell the chain.
Management, however, convinced the private equity firm it could change the retailer's trajectory through a combination of store closures and remodels -- a new format called H2 that has, among other features, more freezers and refrigerators with a broader selection of products.
The refresh worked, too, consistently producing double-digit comps growth when the stores were remodeled. Family Dollar actually became the top chain for Dollar Tree, especially over the past year. Where comparable store sales rose 6.1% on a constant currency basis companywide, it was Family Dollar's 10.5% comps gain in 2020 that really carried the business forward. Dollar Tree's comps were up just 2.2% for the full year.
Two is better than one
While there were a number of factors that played a role in Dollar Tree underperforming last year, the COVID-19 pandemic was a key driver for the chain, and bringing together the two chains helped minimize the impact one store or the other might face alone.
For one, Dollar Tree can save money by having combo stores. Instead of having to build two stores, it's able to have just one in the same size building. Two, customers get more for their money and won't have to travel to different locations to complete their shopping. By making the trip more convenient, it should increase customer visits, total ticket, and profits.
Right now the combo stores are targeted to very small communities, towns with just 3,000 to 4,000 people where it doesn't usually build a Dollar Tree store, but the results speak for themselves and it's a concept that could easily be expanded.
The new combo stores are recording comps growth of 20% where they've been introduced, so it's no wonder Dollar Tree sees as many as 3,000 stores for the format.
Don't discount future growth
There's really a lot of moving parts in today's Dollar Tree. It's expanding the higher price points of Dollar Tree Plus! to more stores, it's updating and renovating a large number of Family Dollar stores to its H2 format (1,250 more this year), and it is rolling out more combination stores. Its partnership with Instacart for Family Dollar deliveries could also be huge.
Dollar Tree has a lot going for it that it didn't have going into the pandemic, but even if the conjoined Family Dollar-Dollar Tree format does eventually kill off the true dollar store concept, investors can still be happy about the retailer that survives after.

2021-03-07 00:00:00+00:00,Is Realty Income a Great Dividend Stock?,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/is-realty-income-a-great-dividend-stock-2021-03-07,,,"Income investors typically view a stock's performance differently than those who invest for long-term returns. If you are an income investor, you look more closely at the dividend to see how consistent, sustainable, and high-yielding it is. Of course, good solid annual returns are important too, but they're secondary for those seeking income.
There are a lot of good dividend stocks on the market, and some great ones. Realty Income (NYSE: O) would be classified as a great one. Here's why.
12 payouts per year
Realty Income is a real estate investment trust, or REIT, which owns a portfolio that includes more than 6,500 commercial properties. The properties all have long-term lease agreements, with some 600 different clients in 51 industries in 49 states, as well as Puerto Rico and the United Kingdom. The largest clients include Walgreens, Dollar General, Dollar Tree, 7-Eleven, Circle K, and Walmart, to name a few.

As a REIT, Realty Income is required by law to pay out 90% of its taxable income in dividends. This is the trade-off for not having to pay corporate taxes. As a result, REITs often pay the best dividends on the market, and Realty Income is one of the best of the best.
Unlike most dividend-paying stocks, which distribute payments quarterly, Realty Income pays dividends every month. It pays out $0.23 per share each month for a yield of 4.6% at Friday's close, which is higher than the average yield on the S&P 500, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, and the Equity REIT Index.
Realty Income pays out $2.76 per share each year. So, if you owned 500 shares at its current $60 per share stock price, you'd have $115 in passive income each month and $1,380 per year.
Realty Income prides itself on its dividend -- it's even in the company's branding as ""The Monthly Dividend Company."" Its commitment to that monthly dividend has resulted in 28 straight years of dividend increases at a compound annual growth rate of 4.4%. That qualifies it as a Dividend Aristocrat.
Sustainability and growth
So Realty Income has a great track record of sustaining its dividend, but how does it look going forward?
The company has a pretty low-risk business model as a net-lease REIT. It signs long-term leases, usually 10 to 20 years, with single-tenant commercial businesses, most of them established retail chains. Realty Income basically collects the rent with the renter responsible for most of the operating costs.
Last year, a difficult one for many businesses, showed how dependable Realty Income's business model is. Despite the shutdowns, Realty Income maintained a 97.9% occupancy rate, down only slightly from 98.6% a year ago. It also collected 93.6% of contractual rent in the fourth quarter, which was up from 82% in May. The biggest hit came from the 78 theater properties it owns, which represent about 5.6% of contractual rent, but otherwise, the numbers were solid.
Overall, the company's revenue increased about 6.7% in 2020 to $1.6 billion, and funds from operations, a key measure used by REITs to determine cash flow, was up 9.9% to $1.1 billion. The company increased the size of its portfolio and was able to collect most of its rent under the most difficult of circumstances. This year it should be able to generate earnings growth with GDP growth anticipated and a recovery in the commercial real estate market.
Realty Income's stock price was down about 11% in 2020, but it remains one of the best dividend stocks on the market and should continue to deliver increasing annual payouts for income investors.

2021-03-05 00:00:00+00:00,7 Recession-Proof Stocks to Buy ,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/7-recession-proof-stocks-to-buy-2021-03-05,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Some experts believe there won’t be a downturn in 2021 due to President Joe Biden’s $1.9 trillion in fiscal stimulus. However, others argue that long-term unemployment is approaching a record. For those who believe the latter rather than the former, you might want some recession-proof stocks to buy just in case. 
In May 2018, I discussed three recession-resistant stocks that I thought would do well in the case of a downturn. They were Church & Dwight (NYSE:CHD), DollarTree (NASDAQ:DLTR), and Flowers Foods (NYSE:FLO). All three of these stocks did well during one or both of the 2001 and 2008 recessions. 
Since then, the three stocks appreciated by 68%, 4%, and 11%, respectively, over 33 months. By comparison, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSEARCA:SPY) generated a 33% return over the same period. 
Clearly, we didn’t hit recession territory until well into the pandemic. And, if I’d just gone with Dollar General (NYSE:DG) instead of DollarTree, my average return would have been 58%, not 28%. 
Live and learn, I guess.
9 Cheap Stocks That Look Like a Bargain
Using the Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR (NYSEARCA:XLP) and the Technology Select Sector SPDR (NYSEARCA:XLK), I’ll come up with seven recession-proof stocks to buy:
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)
Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)
Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE)
Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG)
Walmart (NYSE:WMT)
PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP)
Costco (NASDAQ:COST)
Recession-Proof Stocks to Buy: Apple (AAPL)
Source: View Apart / Shutterstock.com
You’re probably wondering about my first selection. 
While Apple might have almost $77 billion in cash, it’s added a lot of debt since the 2008 recession. In 2008 and 2009, Apple didn’t have any long-term debt, along with $24.5 billion and $34.0 billion, respectively, in cash. Today, Apple has $112 billion in total debt, or 32% of its total assets.   
Should consumers find themselves low on cash, big-ticket purchases like a new iPhone probably go right out the window? Well, that’s the standard opinion. 
However, in the last three months of calendar 2008, Apple recorded record revenue of $10.2 billion, selling more than 2.5 million Macs and 4.3 million iPhones. While the iPhone was in the early stages of its overall growth, it was obvious even back then that the smartphone had become its future growth driver.
Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook has wisely built a massive services business to add some balance to the company’s top-and bottom-lines. In Q1 2021, Apple’s gross margins from its services business increased 400 basis points to 68.4% while growing the top line by 24% over last year. 
With Apple’s 5G iPhones coming, it probably seems silly to be talking about recession-resistant stocks. Still, when the economy softens, you’ll want to own shares of quality companies because those stocks will have the best chance of maintaining their share prices in a market correction.   
Well-run companies never go out of style. 
Microsoft (MSFT)

It’s been 11 years since Microsoft launched Azure, the software company’s foray into cloud computing. The company’s commercial cloud business generated $44 billion in revenue in fiscal 2020. In 2015, it was less than $6 billion.  
In fiscal 2009, Microsoft saw its annual revenue drop by $2 billion (-3.4%) to $58.4 billion, its first-ever year-over-year decline. As a result, its operating income fell by 9% to $20.4 billion. 
Imagine owning a business that had 35% operating margins in a bad year. That’s my idea of a recession-resistant business. 
Fast forward to today. It has a 39% operating margin from $153 billion in trailing 12-month revenue. CEO Satya Nadella really has the company humming. 
In the second decade of its existence, it’s hard to imagine Microsoft without Azure. I’m sure we’ll be saying the same thing about another yet-to-be-determined product in 2031.
9 Cheap Stocks That Look Like a Bargain
Interestingly, Microsoft has net cash of $62.6 billion, a number that even puts Apple to shame. 
Adobe (ADBE)
Source: r.classen / Shutterstock.com
One of my better predictions in 202o was that Adobe’s stock would hit $400 in 2020. That was in early February. It hit the target five months later, getting as high as $537.88 in September before settling into a tight range between $460 and $500. 
So, where to next? 
While I won’t make a prediction, I will say that should a recession hit, Adobe’s products will remain in demand because life goes on. PDFs don’t go out of style. Nor does the rest of its product line, including Photoshop, used by approximately 90% of creative professionals.
In 2020, it had record revenue of $12.9 billion, 15% higher than in 2019. On the bottom line, it had an operating income of $1.2 billion, 30% higher than a year earlier. In 2020, it generated $5.7 billion in operating cash flow, enabling it to buy back $3 billion of its stock at an average price of $375 a share. That’s a 23% return on its investment despite the $25 correction year to date.    
The advent of the cloud has made Adobe even more essential in 2021.
This year, Adobe expects to grow sales by 18% to $15.2 billion, with non-GAAP earnings of $11.20 per share. At 41 times 2021 earnings, it’s not cheap. 
Five years from now, you won’t regret having bought ADBE stock. 
Recession-Proof Stocks to Buy: Procter & Gamble (PG)
Source: monticello / Shutterstock.com
Just as I included Church & Dwight in my 2018 article about recession-resistant stocks, Procter & Gamble is the quintessential consumer staples stock. Defensive in nature, it’s managing to make hay while the sun shines. 
It is growing its business at a time where many companies are finding it difficult to prosper. That’s because a lot of its products aren’t things most people will go without — recession or not. 
Of the company’s 22 billion-dollar brands, I use 10 of them daily or weekly. That’s not going to change in a recession. The same can be said for most people who hold down a decent-paying job. 
How did P&G do during the 2008 financial crisis?
Well, leading up to the recession, the company raised prices to fight inflationary pressures in Europe. By Spring 2009, inflation had stopped rising, so it lowered prices. However, it gained approximately $1.4 billion in additional sales from those increases.
Post-recession, the company put into place a plan that would see it introduce cheaper products in markets where consumers couldn’t pay premium prices while keeping prices of many of its billion-dollar brands higher than average. 
In 2009, it generated $9.9 billion in free cash flow (FCF) from $76.7 billion in sales. In 2020, it had adjusted FCF of $14.9 billion from $71.0 billion, an 810 basis point improvement in its FCF margin.

Whatever happens in the next recession, P&G will be ready.
Walmart (WMT)
Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com
When the last recession hit in 2008, Walmart didn’t have the e-commerce infrastructure it has today. That’s made a big difference in its ability to fight through the pandemic. 
Walmart reported its fourth-quarter results in mid-February. It missed the analyst estimate of $1.51 per share by 12 cents. Since delivering its results, WMT stock has lost 13% of its value through March 2.
According to Statista, Walmart had e-commerce sales of $36.9 billion in 2020. That’s approximately 6.6% of its overall revenue of $559.2 billion. In 2013, Walmart’s e-commerce sales were approximately $10 billion or 2.1% of its $476.3 billion in annual sales.
Walmart continues to grow its e-commerce sales at a brisk pace. In the fourth quarter, they were 69% higher than a year earlier. As the margins improve and e-commerce sales grow to represent 10% of its overall revenues, the online business will become a profit center for the company. 
When the last recession hit, Walmart didn’t have much of an online business. Now it does. That will make a huge difference should economic times get really tough. 
In the meantime, enjoy the fruits of its $20 billion share repurchase plan. 
PepsiCo (PEP)

During an economic recession, consumers tend to tighten the purse strings. No major purchases or major financial commitments. That said, it doesn’t mean the family wallet is shut completely with snacks and beverages very low on the priority list of spending cuts. 
In the recession years of 2007 to 2009, PepsiCo stock had a high of $79.57 and a low of $45.81. At the low, its share price declined 42.4% from its high. 
However, its earnings held their own, averaging almost 6% annual growth in 2008 through 2010. For those who care about dividends, PepsiCo increased its annual dividend payout from $1.35 in 2007 to $1.86 in 2010, a compound annual growth rate of 11.3%. 
So, even though the company’s stock didn’t completely hold up during the recession, it managed to get back to its 2007-2009 high of $79.57 by March 2013. 
To keep the company growing, PepsiCo is launching a line of cocktail mixers this month to meet the increased demand for at-home cocktails. Neon Zebra will come with four mixes: Margarita, Strawberry Daiquiri, Mojito, and Whiskey Sour.

Amazingly, the sale of cocktail mixers in the 12 months ended Feb. 13 rose by 36% to $305 million. It will be interesting to see what happens once the world returns to normal.
Recession-Proof Stocks to Buy: Costco (COST)
Source: Helen89 / Shutterstock.com
Costco’s business model makes it one of the best retail stocks to own for the long haul. I did, however, recommend that investors buy a half position, waiting for it to correct over the next three to six  months to buy the other half. 
That time has come. Trading down more than 6% recently, COST stock is down 10% from Oct. 5, 2020, the date of my article, and almost 13% YTD.
Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A, NYSE:BRK.B) vice-chairman Charlie Munger recently stated that Costco held a specific advantage over Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) when it comes to growing its business.
“Costco, I do think, has one thing that Amazon does not. People really trust Costco to be delivering enormous values,” Munger said Feb. 24. “That is why Costco presents some danger to Amazon — because they’ve got a better reputation for providing value than practically anybody including Amazon.”
Years ago, I can remember then CEO, Jim Sinegal, discussing Costco’s relentless push to get the best prices possible from its suppliers. However, it wasn’t to make more money. The move was intended to push prices lower for its customers, making the bulk of its profits from its satisfied members’ annual membership fees. 
Nothing’s changed except that its sales are much higher. 
In fiscal 2009, Costco had membership fees of $1.53 billion, or 2.2% of its annual revenue. In fiscal 2020, they were $3.54 billion, or 2.2% of revenue. That’s a compound annual growth rate of 7.9%.
As every year passes, Costco gets more recession-resistant, not less.

2021-03-04 00:00:00+00:00,"Analyst Estimates: Here's What Brokers Think Of Dollar Tree, Inc. (NASDAQ:DLTR) After Its Yearly Report",DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/analyst-estimates%3A-heres-what-brokers-think-of-dollar-tree-inc.-nasdaq%3Adltr-after-its,,,"It's been a good week for Dollar Tree, Inc. (NASDAQ:DLTR) shareholders, because the company has just released its latest full-year results, and the shares gained 3.0% to US$102. It was a credible result overall, with revenues of US$26b and statutory earnings per share of US$5.65 both in line with analyst estimates, showing that Dollar Tree is executing in line with expectations. Following the result, the analysts have updated their earnings model, and it would be good to know whether they think there's been a strong change in the company's prospects, or if it's business as usual. With this in mind, we've gathered the latest statutory forecasts to see what the analysts are expecting for next year.
NasdaqGS:DLTR Earnings and Revenue Growth March 5th 2021
After the latest results, the 24 analysts covering Dollar Tree are now predicting revenues of US$26.3b in 2022. If met, this would reflect a modest 3.1% improvement in sales compared to the last 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are predicted to rise 8.6% to US$6.17. Before this earnings report, the analysts had been forecasting revenues of US$26.3b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$6.23 in 2022. So it's pretty clear that, although the analysts have updated their estimates, there's been no major change in expectations for the business following the latest results.
The analysts reconfirmed their price target of US$120, showing that the business is executing well and in line with expectations. It could also be instructive to look at the range of analyst estimates, to evaluate how different the outlier opinions are from the mean. The most optimistic Dollar Tree analyst has a price target of US$135 per share, while the most pessimistic values it at US$95.00. As you can see, analysts are not all in agreement on the stock's future, but the range of estimates is still reasonably narrow, which could suggest that the outcome is not totally unpredictable.
Taking a look at the bigger picture now, one of the ways we can understand these forecasts is to see how they compare to both past performance and industry growth estimates. We would highlight that Dollar Tree's revenue growth is expected to slow, with the forecast 3.1% annualised growth rate until the end of 2022 being well below the historical 6.2% p.a. growth over the last five years. By way of comparison, the other companies in this industry with analyst coverage are forecast to grow their revenue at 4.9% per year. So it's pretty clear that, while revenue growth is expected to slow down, the wider industry is also expected to grow faster than Dollar Tree.
The Bottom Line
The most important thing to take away is that there's been no major change in sentiment, with the analysts reconfirming that the business is performing in line with their previous earnings per share estimates. On the plus side, there were no major changes to revenue estimates; although forecasts imply revenues will perform worse than the wider industry. There was no real change to the consensus price target, suggesting that the intrinsic value of the business has not undergone any major changes with the latest estimates.
Following on from that line of thought, we think that the long-term prospects of the business are much more relevant than next year's earnings. We have estimates - from multiple Dollar Tree analysts - going out to 2026, and you can see them free on our platform here.
That said, it's still necessary to consider the ever-present spectre of investment risk. We've identified 1 warning sign with Dollar Tree , and understanding it should be part of your investment process.

2021-03-04 00:00:00+00:00,DLTR April 23rd Options Begin Trading,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/dltr-april-23rd-options-begin-trading-2021-03-04,,,"Investors in Dollar Tree Inc (Symbol: DLTR) saw new options begin trading today, for the April 23rd expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the DLTR options chain for the new April 23rd contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $101.00 strike price has a current bid of $2.91. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $101.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $98.09 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of DLTR, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $102.16/share today.
Because the $101.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 100%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 2.88% return on the cash commitment, or 21.05% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Dollar Tree Inc, and highlighting in green where the $101.00 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $103.00 strike price has a current bid of $4.10. If an investor was to purchase shares of DLTR stock at the current price level of $102.16/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $103.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 4.84% if the stock gets called away at the April 23rd expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if DLTR shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Dollar Tree Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing DLTR's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $103.00 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $103.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 4.01% boost of extra return to the investor, or 29.32% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.
Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $102.16) to be 48%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

Shares of the retail company declined 1.3% in Wednesday’s extended trading session after closing almost 3% higher on the day.
Dollar Tree’s (DLTR) 4Q adjusted earnings increased 19% year-over-year to $2.13 per share and beat Street estimates of $2.11 per share. Net sales advanced 7.2% to $6.77 billion missing analysts’ expectations of $6.79 billion.
The company’s enterprise same-store sales grew 5% in the quarter, while same-store sales for family dollar surged 8.1%. Dollar Tree same-store sales rose 2.4%. The gross margin expanded by 80 basis points.
Dollar Tree CEO Michael Witynski said, “As we look ahead, we believe our proven strategic store formats, accelerated store growth plan, 1,250 planned store renovations for the year, several key sales - and traffic-driving initiatives, and a robust balance sheet will enable us to deliver long-term value for each of our stakeholders - customers, associates, suppliers, and shareholders.” (See Dollar Tree stock analysis on TipRanks)
Additionally, the company bumped up its share repurchase authorization plan by $2 billion. Dollar Tree now has a total $2.4 billion share repurchase authorization, including the remaining $400 million of its prior authorization.
Following the 4Q results, Oppenheimer analyst Rupesh Parikh reiterated a Hold rating on the stock. The analyst “remains concerned on the company’s ability to deliver sustained levels of comp and profit growth.”
Parikh believes “investors are best to remain on the sidelines for now.”
The rest of the Street is cautiously optimistic about the stock with a Moderate Buy consensus rating. That’s based on 3 analysts suggesting a Buy, 1 analyst recommending a Hold and 1 analyst suggests a Sell. The average analyst price target of $122 implies almost 20% upside potential to current levels. Shares have jumped 29% over the past year.

2021-03-03 00:00:00+00:00,Better Buy: Costco vs. Dollar Tree,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/better-buy%3A-costco-vs.-dollar-tree-2021-03-03,,,"Both Costco (NASDAQ: COST) and Dollar Tree (NASDAQ: DLTR) have benefited from shifts in consumer buying patterns, and both appeal to shoppers looking for value. But the two companies have different business models. While Dollar Tree sells products with a price point of $1 and its Family Dollar stores sell products at $10 and under, Costco sells high-quality goods at a very wide range of prices to its members.
One of these consumer discretionary companies is a better longer-term investment because of its positioning in retail and its growth strategies. Once the pandemic subsides and people revert to normal buying patterns, there is one company that is more insulated from the intense competition in the retail space.

Costco
Costco's business model is differentiated and consumer-centric: It offers high-quality products at low markups. When people shop at Costco, they know they are getting some of the best prices relative to quality. While Costco's merchandise sales are at lower margins, its membership fees are at much higher margins.
Costco's loyal member base helps to drive stability in its revenue and earnings. The company's North American membership renewal rates remained near record highs over the last two earnings quarters, at around 91%. The company also saw total paid households up to 59.1 million at the end of the first quarter (ended Nov. 22 ), compared to 58.1 million at the end of the fourth quarter.
Set for long-term growth
Costco has seen steady revenue growth over the last five years: 2.2% in 2016, 8.7% in 2017, 9.7% in 2018, 7.9% in 2019, and 9.2% in 2020. More recently, Costco reported a January monthly sales increase of 17.9% year over year, with comparable sales up 15.7% (excluding gas prices and foreign exchange). This is up from December's (five weeks ended Jan. 3) comparable sales increase of 10.7% versus consensus expectations of 9.5%.
Image Source: YCharts.
The company is relatively insulated from competition from large e-commerce players like Amazon, which are seeing faster revenue expansion. Costco offers very good value and a large selection of quality, in-house branded products, mostly in the groceries and household goods categories. The company caps its markups at 14% for non-Costco brands and 15% for its in-house brands, much lower than the typical 25%-50% markup of typical retailers. Costco also offers gas and pharmaceutical products that drive additional store traffic. The warehouse retailer's strong value proposition combined with the loyalty of its members gives it a larger moat compared to the average retail company.
Costco has room to expand in e-commerce, which is growing but is only about 7% of Costco's total business (excluding third-party sales from vendors like Instacart). In the first quarter, Costco's e-commerce segment saw revenue increasing 86.4%, indicating more opportunity in the future. Costco's March 2020 purchase of Innovel, a delivery and installation company, should help drive its e-commerce sales of home goods. Innovel specializes in items like appliances and furniture.
Dollar Tree
Discount retailer Dollar Tree has benefited in 2020 as shoppers stocked up on groceries and household staples. While people always like discounts, the recent virus-driven recession has pushed people to favor discount stores. These factors drove a 28.7% increase year over year in earnings per share during Dollar Tree's latest third-quarter earnings (ended Oct. 31), following the second quarter's 44.7% increase .
While the pandemic-driven sales boost will ease as normalcy returns, Dollar Tree's earnings growth will likely slow. Consensus analyst projections are forecasting a 17% increase in full-year fiscal 2020 earnings and an 11% increase in 2021. However, Dollar Tree has initiatives that could help it exceed these future estimates.
New initiatives to increase profitability
Management's been sprucing up its Family Dollar segment, which was 46.5% of total company sales in the third quarter (ended Oct. 31) over the past several years. The plan includes closing underperforming stores, renovating existing stores, and converting some stores into Dollar Tree units. During fiscal year 2019 (ended Feb. 1, 2020 ), Dollar Tree closed over 400 Family Dollar stores and converted 200 Family Dollar stores into Dollar Trees. More recently, Dollar Tree upgraded 371 Family Dollar stores in the third quarter.
Dollar Tree has seen results from its plans to improve sales at Family Dollar: During the first nine months of 2020, Family Dollar's operating margin improved to 5%, up from 2% a year ago. During the third quarter, the segment's net sales increased by 7.5% year over year. Further improvements are being made, with e-commerce launched for familydollar.com during the third quarter, providing added convenience.
Another initiative toward future earnings growth is Dollar Tree Plus! (began in mid-2019), a merchandising update that offers additional products at slightly higher prices points, mostly between $3 and $5. The higher-priced merchandise should help lift margins in the future. ""Our customers are buying these products and sales of our multi-price items continue to grow. In fact, we are seeing that when multi-price items are included in the basket, the average transaction value is approximately twice the size,"" noted CEO Michael Witynski on the third quarter earnings call. Dollar Tree has plans to add Dollar Tree Plus! to about 500 of its stores in 2021.
The winner
While both of these retailers are appealing in the current environment, I like Costco more for its bigger moat and unique value proposition for both investors and customers. Costco's membership model gives it a relatively sticky customer base and subjects it to less competition than Dollar Tree. Therefore, Costco is the better investment for its greater stability and growth prospects in various economic environments.

Michael A. Witynski -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Thank you, Randy.
Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining me today. What a year. I believe that from now, that years from now, many of us will reflect upon 2020 as being one of the most unique, unpredictable and challenging business environments of our career. My sincerest gratitude goes out to our one 195,000 plus associates working in more than 15,600 Dollar Tree and Family Dollar stores and in 26 distribution centers, and to our field leadership teams as well as our store support team here in Chesapeake, Virginia. Your commitment and dedication to protect and serve our customers is critical to our Company's success. As an essential retailer in the value segment, we will continue to be part of the solution for millions of households across North America. Additionally, I would like to recognize our business partners, both supply chain and suppliers, for their efforts to support our business throughout the year.
In 2020, we exceeded $25 billion in annual sales for the first time, and we have a long runway of growth ahead of us. As our business grows, so does the need and support from each of our business partners. We appreciate your continued support.
The recent trends have been encouraging. COVID cases are on the decline and vaccinations are on the rise. However, we will continue to be relentless in our efforts to protect each other until this pandemic is behind us. I am very pleased with the team's operating performance for the fourth quarter, highlighted by solid same-store sales increase, improved gross margin and expense leverage. The team delivered EPS increase of 310% compared to the prior year's quarter or 19% when adjusted for discrete charges in the prior year. Our results included a 4.9% enterprise comp increase, an 80 basis point improvement in gross profit margin and a 90 basis point increase in operating profit margin when compared to prior year's adjusted numbers.
Our Dollar Tree segment delivered another quarter of positive same-store sales, with a 2.4% increase. January was the strongest month of the quarter, followed by November. In fact, January was our strongest month in comps since April of 2019. December was slightly negative as store traffic was impacted by an escalation in COVID cases, resulting in expanded lockdowns and significantly fewer holiday social gathering among families, companies, churches and schools. As we have seen in the onset of the pandemic, sales were again driven by average ticket, which increased 17.9% as shoppers continued to consolidate trips. Comp transaction count declined 13.1%.
We delivered a 36.1% gross margin -- and Dollar Tree's operating margin, which included $13.8 million in COVID-related costs came in at 16% operating income. Categories performing well included crafts, seasonal, household products, floral, kitchenware and beauty and eyewear. Building on the continued success of crafts department, we completed the rollout of Crafter's Square to all US Dollar Tree stores in January.
Inspiring the creativity of our customers is at the core of Dollar Tree, and we are thrilled to provide an even broader assortment of art and craft supplies at tremendous values. With our $1 fixed price point and more than 7,500 US store locations, Crafter's Square presents customers with an unlimited solutions for current learn-from-home and work-from-home environment. Additionally, terrific opportunities exist for DIY home projects in decor, crafts for the entire family, seasonal decorations and handmade gifts. Our shoppers love the expanded assortment, which is validated by the excitement Crafter's Square is generating across social media platforms, including YouTube and Instagram.
Regarding our Dollar Tree Plus!, our shoppers love the values, and we exceeded our initial sales plan for the fourth quarter. We had great sell-through on our seasonal products, on our tools and household consumables. We are on schedule to kick off the previously announced expansion of Dollar Tree Plus! this month. We are expanding multi-price assortment from the current base of 120 stores to a total of 500 stores and will be completed by August. Additionally, we are capturing great buying synergies as the majority of the $3 and $5 merchandise for the DT Plus! will be offered in both banners.
Family Dollar sales highlights for the quarter included an 8.1% comp increase, comprised of a 21.9% expansion in average ticket, partially offset by 11.3% decline in transaction count. This is similar to the ticket traffic trip consolidation dynamic we have seen since Q1 of 2020. Regarding the cadence of comps, all three months were positive, with January being the strongest month. As a reminder, all Family Dollar stores were closed on Christmas Day in 2020 which has impacted December comp results as approximately 5,600 stores were open for business the previous year.
January was Family Dollar's strongest monthly comp since May of last year. We saw solid sales across many of the discretionary categories that we've been focused on improving, including home decor, apparel, household cleaning, lawn and garden, party, beauty care and seasonal. The consumable side of the business delivered another positive quarterly comp at 6.2%, and the discretionary comp was a strong 13.5% comp. In Q4, discretionary as a percent of net sales at Family Dollar increased 120 basis points to 26.2% of sales. Similar to recent quarters, based on third-party data, our market share in discretionary grew 2 times faster than the remaining market in Q4. Late in 2020, we launched our initial test for produce and frozen needs at select Family Dollar stores, targeting markets where shoppers have fewer local grocery options. We want to provide shoppers with convenient access to basic produce items as well as beef, poultry and pork. We plan to expand our test in 2021.
We recently announced the expansion of our new partnership with Instacart platform across the US. Same-day delivery is another example of meeting the evolving needs of Family Dollar shoppers. The initial results have exceeded our expectations, and we continue to receive very positive feedback from shoppers. These transactions have materially higher average ticket, and we believe the Instacart platform is enabling us to broaden our Family Dollar customer base. Interestingly, in the first three weeks of the national rollout, more than 80% of Family Dollar stores had one or more Instacart transactions.
As always, our most important scorecards come from our shoppers. We are seeing considerable improvements in our customer satisfaction survey scores. For Q4, we saw record numbers across each of the four key categories: store cleanliness, product assortment, customer service and speed of checkout. In fact, each of these categories have shown improvement for three consecutive quarters. Contributors to this success is an enhanced Family Dollar brand strategy program that clearly conveys expectations and examples to our store teams. And the chain's annual store manager turnover are at the best in over a decade. The improved customer satisfaction results gives us confidence that we will be able to retain shoppers that discovered or reengaged with Family Dollar during the pandemic.
Regarding Dollar Tree Canada, the team delivered another solid quarter, exceeding its plan for sales, gross margin and operating income.
From a real estate perspective, we completed more than 280 projects, including 124 new stores, 11 relocations, 106 Family Dollar renovations and 45 store closings. We ended the year with 15,685 stores.
We accomplished a great deal in 2020. Much of this was made possible by our 2019 initiatives that really set the stage to begin traction and momentum in 2020 and beyond. To quickly recap, in 2019 we consolidated our Dollar Tree and Family Dollar store support centers into one campus, greatly improving efficiencies through enhanced communication, collaboration and support. We made tremendous progress on Family Dollar's store optimization initiatives by rebannering 200 stores, closing more than 400 stores and doubling the pace of our renovation program to more than 1,000 per year. We also launched our initial test for Dollar Tree Plus!. And we realigned our leadership team to enhance and align the consistency of communication, strategies, processes and workflows. For example, Dollar Tree and Family Dollar merchants went through 2020 in complete unison for buying calendars, buying trips meetings, planning dates and category performance reviews. This strength in alignment was very evident in the success of our recent virtual buying trip in January, which is our biggest buying trip for the year. These initiatives helped build the foundation for 2020 performance.
The progress we have made in Family Dollar in the past, despite the pandemic has been remarkable. We are benefiting from improved store conditions and better execution on initiatives, resulting in market share gains. We have also seen improved customer satisfaction scores, store turnover and trend improvements. I am convinced that Family Dollar will exit the pandemic as a much stronger organization. This progress is why I'm more enthusiastic about the opportunities in 2021 and beyond, including the expansion of Dollar Tree Plus! and the growth of our new combination stores into small towns across America.
I will go into more detail on our plans for 2021 after Kevin speaks to the Q4 performance and our outlook. Kevin?

The fourth quarter consolidated net sales increased 7.2% to $6.77 billion, comprised of $3.71 billion of Dollar Tree and $3.06 billion at Family Dollar. Enterprise same-store sales increased 4.9% or 5% when adjusted for Canadian currency fluctuations. Comps for Family Dollar increased 8.1% and Dollar Tree segment increased 2.4%.
Overall gross profit for the enterprise increased 9.8% to $2.15 billion and gross margin improved 80 basis points to 31.8%. Gross profit margin for the Dollar Tree segment decreased 10 basis points to 36.1% when compared to the prior year's quarter. The factors impacting the segment's gross margin performance included distribution costs increased 40 basis points, primarily due to higher payroll costs and depreciation. This includes the continued ramp-up of the two new distribution centers as well as $4.4 million or 10 basis points of COVID-related expenses, primarily premium pay and bonuses. These higher DC costs as a percentage of net sales were partially offset by a 20 basis point improvement in markdowns and a 5 basis point improvement in shrink. Merchandise costs, including freight, also improved 5 basis points. Improvements in merchandise mix and mark-on were mostly offset by increased freight costs.
Gross profit margin for the Family Dollar segment improved 200 basis points to 26.6% in the fourth quarter. The year-over-year improvement was due to the following. Markdown expense improved 100 basis points due to lower promotional activities and improved sell-through of seasonal merchandise at apparel. Occupancy costs decreased by 50 [Phonetic] basis points from leverage on the 8.1% comp sales increase. Shrink improved 35 basis points on improved inventory results. Distribution costs improved approximately 15 basis points compared to the prior year quarter. The current year quarter included approximately $3.2 million or 10 basis points of COVID-related expenses, primarily premium pay and bonuses. And regarding merchandise costs, including freight, improvements in merchandise mix and mark-on were essentially offset by increased freight costs during the quarter.
And consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses improved 540 basis points to 21.7% of net sales compared to 27.1% in Q4 a year ago. The prior year's quarter included a $313 million non-cash pre-tax and after-tax goodwill impairment charge, an $18 million charge to litigation reserve. Excluding these items from the prior year's quarter, SG&A expenses improved 20 basis points from an adjusted 21.9% of net sales.
For the fourth quarter, the SG&A rate for the Dollar Tree segment as a percentage of net sales improved slightly to 20.1% of net sales when compared to the prior year's quarter. Payroll costs increased approximately 30 basis points and was comprised of the following. Payroll expenses increased approximately $7.2 million or 20 basis points for costs associated with COVID-19-related payroll and bonuses. Additionally, increased incentive compensation was partially offset by lower health insurance benefits.
Other selling, general and administrative expenses decreased approximately 20 basis points, primarily from reduced travel and lower legal and professional fees. Depreciation costs decreased 10 basis points. Excluding goodwill impairment and litigation reserve charges from the prior year's quarter, the SG&A rate for the Family Dollar segment improved approximately 80 basis points to 20.6% compared to an adjusted 21.4% for the fourth quarter of 2019. Depreciation improved 30 basis points, primarily [Indecipherable] strong comp sales increase. Other selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by approximately 30 basis points primarily due to lower advertising and travel costs as a percentage of net sales. Payroll related expenses improved approximately 15 basis points, and store facility costs improved approximately 5 basis points, primarily from leverage on comp sales and lower electricity costs. Corporate and support expenses increased 20 basis points, primarily related to higher incentive comp and stock compensation expense compared to the prior year's quarter.
Operating income improved 173% to $681.6 million compared with $249.4 million in the same period last year, and operating income margin was 10.1% in the fourth quarter compared with 3.9% in the prior year's quarter. Excluding the $313 million goodwill impairment and $18 million litigation reserve from the prior year's quarter, operating income margin improved 90 basis points from the adjusted 9.2%. Q4 of 2020 included total incremental operating costs of $24.8 million for COVID-19-related expenses. These incremental costs by segment were $13.8 million for Dollar Tree, $10.6 million for Family Dollar and $0.4 million for corporate support and other. Nonoperating expenses totaled $34.2 million, comprised of net interest expense.
Our effective tax rate was 22.3% compared to 41.3% in the prior year's fourth quarter. The prior year rate was affected by the non-cash goodwill impairment charge that was not tax deductible. Without the goodwill impairment charge, the tax rate for Q4 2019 would have been 16.6%, which included a reduction in tax expense of $24.6 million for the reversal of the valuation allowance related to the Company's foreign net operating loss carry-forwards.
Company had net income of $502.8 million or $2.13 per diluted share, which included $0.08 per diluted share for COVID-19-related expenses. This compared to a net earnings of $123 million or $0.52 per share in the prior year's quarter and an adjusted earnings per share of $1.79.
Combined cash and cash equivalents at year-end totaled $1.42 billion compared to $539.2 million at the end of fiscal 2019. The Company paid off the $300 million legacy Family Dollar note during the quarter. Outstanding debt as of January 30, 2021, was $3.25 billion. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 1.83 million shares for $200 million. With the Board action announced this morning, we now have $2.4 billion authorized for share repurchases. We will continue to invest in our business and will provide first quarter updates on share repurchase activity. Inventory for Dollar Tree at year-end declined 5.9% from the same time last year while selling square footage increased 3.7%. Inventory per selling square foot decreased 9.2%. Inventory for Family Dollar at year-end increased 0.5% from the same period last year, while selling square footage increased 1.8%. Inventory per selling square foot decreased 1.3%. Our inventory levels improved in Q4 and we continue to be more productive with lower inventory, significantly increasing our inventory turns.
Capital expenditures were $191.8 million in the fourth quarter versus $252.5 million in Q4 last year. For fiscal 2021, we are planning for consolidated capital expenditures to be approximately $1.2 billion. Capital expenditures will be focused on 600 new stores and 1,250 Family Dollar H2 renovations. And these stores will be 400 Dollar Tree stores and 200 Family Dollar stores, including both H2 and combo store formats based on market locations. The addition of frozen and refrigerated capabilities to Dollar Tree and Family Dollar stores, IT system enhancements and projects, development of our Chesapeake campus, installation of LED lighting and HVAC [Indecipherable] replacements in select stores and the ongoing construction for the second phase of our new distribution center in Ocala, Florida.
Depreciation and amortization totaled $182.9 million for Q4 compared to $179.1 million in the fourth quarter last year. And for the year, depreciation expense totaled $686.6 million. For fiscal 2021, we expect consolidated depreciation and amortization to range from $720 million to $730 million.
Due to a number of variables and uncertainties, we're not providing specific sales and EPS guidance. These variables include unknowns related to the COVID pandemic and its impact to customer shopping patterns, timing and magnitude of government stimulus and potential for the planning of changes to federal minimum wage. I do want to share some points to assist your modeling for 2021. The February storms that brought snow and freezing temperatures through Texas and much of the central part of the state resulted in more than 5,500 lost store days with closures of Dollar Tree and Family Dollar stores in areas most impacted. Stores are now back open and operating but Q1 sales will be impacted from these closures. We will be cycling the 2020 onset of the COVID pandemic in Q1. Our business segments were impacted in different ways a year ago. At Dollar Tree, both sales and gross margin were negatively impacted by loss in discretionary Easter related seasonal sales. As a result, in Q1 of 2020, the Dollar Tree segment had a 0.9% comp decrease and a 31.9% gross margin. At Family Dollar, for Q1, we will be cycling a 15.5% comp increase in the prior year, which will be our toughest quarterly compare for 2021.
We face headwinds from minimum wage and freight costs in 2021. The minimum wage has increased in certain states and localities and may increase nationally depending on the outcome of future legislation. The currently scheduled minimum wage increases are estimated to increase store payroll by $45 million to $50 million in 2021. We are experiencing some delays in receiving import merchandise as a result of worldwide equipment shortages and issues with port congestion. As a result of current market conditions, we're seeing significant increases in cost of import freight and moderate pressure on domestic freight. We currently project $80 million to $100 million of additional costs in fiscal 2021 as a result of these market conditions. These costs primarily affect the first three quarters of the year, as currently projected. We believe these headwinds will be more than offset by productivity and cost savings initiatives such as Crafter's Square, H2 and combo stores, continued focus in shrink and reduced COVID related costs. We incurred COVID related costs of $279 million in 2020 to support our associates, stores and customers. We will continue to incur costs for COVID activities in 2021, but we believe at a materially reduced level. With expect tailwinds as well. COVID relief checks are anticipated to provide a significant lift. We also expect that as COVID abates, customer traffic could return to more normalized levels. Net interest expense is expected to be approximately $34 million in Q1 and approximately $135 million for fiscal 2021.
Our outlook assumes a tax rate of 23.5% for the third quarter and 23.2% for fiscal 2021. Weighted average diluted share counts are assumed to be 234.5 million shares for Q1 and 234.8 million shares for the full year. Our outlook does not include any share repurchases. But as noted, we increased our share repurchase authorization to $2.4 billion. Over the past several years, the Company has reduced its debt from the acquisition by over $5 billion returning to a solid investment grade rating. With our strong flexible balance sheet, we will be able to increase store growth return to share repurchases as an important part of capital allocation going forward. We expect to complete the $2.4 billion share repurchase authorization over the next two years or so.
I'll now turn the call back over to Mike.
Michael A. Witynski -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Kevin.
Again, I'm extremely proud of the team's efforts for fiscal 2020. For the year, our customer satisfaction scores are improving, and we are experiencing our lowest store manager turnover rates in many years. The team delivered an enterprise comp increase of 6.1%. Gross profit increased by more than $740 million, a 70 basis point improvement. We delivered our SG&A costs, which were flat year-over-year as a percent of net sales despite incurring $279 million or 110 basis points in COVID-related costs. Enterprise operating profit margin improved 70 basis points to 7.4%. The Company repurchased $400 million in shares and ended of the year with more than $1.4 billion in cash on the balance sheet. And we delivered annual diluted EPS of $5.65.
This morning, we announced our newest and tested concept that is working remarkably well in rural markets, what we refer to as our combination or combo store format. As I have said in the past, we will continue to refine strategic store formats designed to serve more customers in all types of geographic markets while improving store productivity, margins and returns. The combination store leverages both Dollar Tree and Family Dollar brands to serve small towns across the country. The store combines Family Dollar's great value and assortment with Dollar Tree's [Indecipherable] and $1 price point, trying a new format targeted for populations ranging from 3,000 to 4,000 people. These are markets where we traditionally do not open a Dollar Tree store alone. We opened the first test combination store in late 2019, followed by two additional test stores in early 2020. Closely analyzing the store performance and customer feedback and utilizing learnings, we refined the concept.
Between July 2020 and calendar year end, we opened or renovated 32 additional stores, and currently we have nearly 50 new stores in small towns like Wynnville, Alabama; [Indecipherable] Georgia; Ravena, New York and dozens of others. Compared to other small market Family Dollar stores, these combination stores are delivering same-store sales lift of greater than 10% on average. Combination stores are more productive, delivering higher gross margins and are better leveraging store costs. Our successful H2 stores and combination stores will both be part of the Family Dollar new store and renovation strategy moving forward. We are extremely pleased with our customers' response to the new combination store concept. Our goal is to have formats that leverage the best of Dollar Tree and Family Dollar brands to serve customers in all types of geographic markets. We believe we can continue to change, evolve and improve. To really share why we are very excited to introduce this new format, we are providing a three-minute video, along with photos, introducing the new combination stores at familydollar.com/combostores. Please go check it out.
Our teams worked incredibly hard throughout fiscal 2020. I could not be more proud of our team's commitment, dedication and focus. We believe our proven strategic store formats and accelerated store growth plan, 1,250 planned store renovations for the year, several key sales and traffic driven initiatives, along with our robust balance sheet will enable us to deliver long-term value for each of our stakeholders, our customers, associates, suppliers and shareholders.
Operator, we are now ready to take questions.
Questions and Answers:
Operator
[Operator Instructions] It does look like we have our first question on the line from Kelly Bania from BMO Capital. Please go ahead.
Kelly Bania -- BMO Capital -- Analyst
Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking our questions. I wanted to ask just first about payroll and the freight costs that you called out. And just if you could help us understand at a greater level of detail how you're getting to that $45 million to $50 million impact from payroll and $80 million to $100 million on freight. And I think the comment was that these pressures are expected to be more than offset by other factors. So just want to make sure I'm understanding. Are you suggesting that you are expecting EBIT growth in 2021 or maybe just elaborate on that.
Kevin S. Wampler -- Chief Financial Officer
Sure, Kelly. It's Kevin. Good morning. Yeah, so we wanted to give some color obviously as to what's going on. Obviously, not giving specific guidance given the many variables that are out there right now. The $45 million to $50 million that we spoke to in regards to payroll is very specific -- our operations. Labor Department looks at that by state. We know there's approximately 30 states affected this year in our labor pool in those states. We know how many hourly people we have and we go through that calculation on that. Now, that's no different than any other year. This is just really the first time we've given you a number as to what it relates to. We have done -- we have faced these same type of increases over the last couple of years. At this time, we're just trying to put some brackets around it to help people understand the size of that.
As it relates to the freight costs, again, our current projection is roughly $80 million to $100 million. Really fairly comparable across both banners. It is much more import related and domestic related system, probably 75-25, 80-20 as far as important related at this point in time, and that is just based upon the current market conditions that we currently face. As many of you know, we go to market with our freight contracts, our important freight contracts in the spring here. These are negotiated in March and April to go live then in May. So, really, a lot has been talked about in the marketplace in general. So I don't think there should be a lot of surprise around that. And again, just trying to give a idea of the -- of the size of that.
And then, obviously if we look at the offsets, obviously COVID costs in and of themselves last year, we talked about was $279 million. If we -- even if we've said we spent at the same rate we did in Q4, which is roughly $25 million, we will spend obviously significantly less going into the New Year. So I'll let you guys do the math on that at the end of the day, but those are the puts and takes. And also beyond that, obviously driving sales -- I think we obviously talked this morning about how we'll continue to drive sales. But also there's other items. When we look at shrink as a potential good item after maybe a second year in a row after having an upswing a couple of years prior to that. So some good progress being made there. We're still not where we think we can get to. But really proud of the team, the operations teams and the asset protection team. We've been working hard to mitigate the issue that we face there.
Kelly Bania -- BMO Capital -- Analyst
That's very helpful. And then just wanted to ask on the combination stores. Any color you can give us on the new store economic model? The cost of the stores, the size and sales per square foot and how the returns maybe compare to the H2s?
Michael A. Witynski -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. So right now the stores are about 10,500 sq. ft. So they're slightly bigger than what a normal Dollar Tree store would be. And we like the economics of -- our sales are exceeding -- the comp sales are 20% or greater on average and we're going into a new market that they're performing better than our expectation of when it was just a Family Dollar as a stand-alone store. And you can imagine the margins are enhanced because now you've got the mix of Dollar Tree product in there at the $1 price point, and in the categories that normally are higher margins. And you're leveraging it with one store manager and one store team and delivering two brands to a customer and to a small town and we like the results.
Operator
[Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from Joe Feldman with Telsey Advisory Group. Please go ahead.
Joe Feldman -- Telsey Advisory Group -- Analyst
Great, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask on freight, again. Kevin, as you mentioned, you guys do renegotiate freight every spring. And I guess I'm a little confused why you'd be seeing so much pressure, at least in the fourth quarter. I guess, are they allowed to put surcharges on your negotiated rates or -- I understand I guess you're assuming it will be just higher pressure for this year, but maybe could share a little more color on that?
Kevin S. Wampler -- Chief Financial Officer
Sure, Joe. As you look at it, we contract for a certain volume of containers. It's been a big year from a import standpoint, obviously. And so at some point if you exceed your volume, we pay more potentially based upon the marketplace. The spot market -- and you guys see all the things and explanation that we see, has been up significantly in general. And again, a part of the supply and demand, there is a backup in China, in Asia, and to get good move in some instances, people are paying more. And it's not just us. You've heard other retailers over the last two weeks speak to it as well. So it's not -- it's not Dollar Tree specific. It's an industry issue. And our team is working through that and moving our goods. We've been able to keep our seasonal goods coming in and feel good about that. But in general, based on where the marketplace is predicted to be, that is our best projection as we sit here today.
Joe Feldman -- Telsey Advisory Group -- Analyst
Got it. Thanks. And then a follow-up question. As you think about '21, and I know you're not giving too much detail on guidance, but I guess how should we think about the profitability of the two different brands? Family Dollar has been much better. We've seen a lot of improvement there. Should we expect continued greater improvement within the Family Dollar profitability versus kind of stable at the Dollar Tree business?
Kevin S. Wampler -- Chief Financial Officer
Well, Joe, I think as we think about it, I mean, we obviously -- we think there's opportunities in both. We've made a big leap this year with the Family Dollar operating income, going in the right direction. It's still not where we want it to be ultimately. We've made big stride. And we do believe obviously as we began 2020 we spoke a lot about discretionary business and building that side of the house and being a more important player and building that kind of muscle. And obviously the pandemic helped with that, but we do believe that we've made strides. And, again, I think Mike, in his comments, talked about the fact that our -- growing twice the market in that -- in that piece of business. So that's a great opportunity to continue to go. But better, there may be -- we think there's other opportunities as well. You look at the -- as we talk about the combo store, we think that's a great opportunity. We believe there's at a minimum 3,000 locations out there where we can play an important role in our customers' lives on a day-to-day basis and be their -- and be their place to shop for many, many things. They may not live close to a very large metropolitan area, and so it's a big opportunity as we think about it. So a lot of opportunity there.
I think on the Dollar Tree side, I think -- again, there always will be opportunity. and Dollar Tree has evolved over the years, as you well know, in the sense of -- we always reinvent ourselves. Most recently, we talked about snack zone, we've talked about our Crafter's Square initiative and again some of these initiatives are traffic driving, some of these are really margin driving and -- but it's always relevant to the consumer. And the $1 fixed price point does not go out of style. People love the value it provides. And now we can add upon that. Obviously, taking the Dollar Tree Plus! Opportunity, expanding into 500 store, continuing to learn and build upon that, and really be able to take and benefit both banners are taking that $3 and $5 product.
Michael A. Witynski -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Joe, this is Mike. I agree with Kevin. I am so excited about 2021. And I absolutely believe there's growth for both banners. And Kevin hit on them. I mean, I'll start with Family Dollar. We are absolutely going to come out stronger on the backside of the pandemic than on the front side for a lot of reasons. And I think about what Kevin was speaking to on March 4 of last year. Our comp sales and consumables were strong low single digit quarter after quarter, and where we needed to focus our energy was on the discretionary side. And it was a year ago in December that Rick McNeely was assigned to be the lead merchant for both banners and really leverage synergies where possible and bring disciplines and capabilities to the Family Dollar team.
So during this pandemic, we didn't just survive through it. We thrived through it and changed our disciplines and strategies. And when you looked at -- in our merchandising, we've looked at our basic assortment of what we're carrying at sharper price points. We got better values. And we're not going to go back to the old way. We're going to improve upon that. And the pandemic really accelerated our inventory from the past and really flushed that through last year, and then our new receipts coming in on all the disciplines that I just got done describing are really selling at a great mix, stronger sell-throughs, less markdowns and better turns.
But the second thing is our stores. You heard us talk about our customer satisfaction scores across the board for three quarters are improving. We've invested a lot in getting better initiatives and execution in our stores and our customers are responding. And we'll have that carrying forward compared to going into the pandemic. The fourth thing, as Kevin said, is we've got clear direction now on a format strategy. We've got H2 format that is continuing to produce 10% comp, so when we go in and renovate them -- and we're going to renovate another 1,250 of them this year. And then this wonderful new store of a combo store in small towns that is producing a 20% comp, it's another thing that we didn't have prior to the last year going into the pandemic. And then our balance sheet, as Kevin spoke about. We generate a lot of cash flow and we've got $1.4 billion on our balance sheet, and that enables us to be very flexible and grow this Company like we haven't grown before because we don't have to pay $1 billion to $1.2 billion every year to pay down the debt. We can use it flexible to grow this Company and grow shareholder value.
And then the last thing I would say on Family Dollar side is -- and we haven't abandoned [Phonetic] the digital and omnichannel business. And you heard us just now tipping our toes into Instagram -- or Instacart. And the Instacart has just given a huge response for our customers and it give us a broader -- able to serve a broader segment of this customer with Instacart. So there's another upside with our digital and omnichannel. And then you've heard us about Dollar Tree Plus!. We will always grow that business and refine those categories. And now we have our Crafter's Square in all of Dollar Tree. Just got it done in January. We're going to go this entire year with Crafter's Square. And you've heard us talk about Dollar Tree Plus! So we're going to drive that Dollar Tree Plus!.
And then, Dollar Tree Inc. didn't perform that well because of those COVID-related. If you look at our fourth quarter, our November comps in Dollar Tree were spectacular and our January the best in three years. What happened was, December lockdown because of the COVID cases increased and spiked at highest levels across the country, and you all saw that. And the states because of that increased the lockdowns, people did not move around. And what happens is there wasn't any celebrations. The Dollar Tree feeds those celebrations in the schools, in the churches, at home, at work parties. And all of our party categories that flourish during the -- the first 10 days before Christmas. And it just didn't happen because of COVID. Outside of that, we had a great quarter with 2.4% comp, which was better than the fourth quarter in 2019, and we had a COVID problem. So we deliver a 36 plus margin and a 16% [Phonetic] comp income at Family Dollar, and I believe we can beat that next year. So, yeah, to answer your question, I believe we're going to have a successful year at both banners for those reasons.
Joe Feldman -- Telsey Advisory Group -- Analyst
That's really helpful, and I hope that proves true. Thank you so much, guys. I appreciate it.
Operator
Okay. And we'll take our next question from Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Paul Trussell -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst
Good morning. And thank you for all the color. I guess I wanted to maybe just follow up the comments with maybe some bigger picture questions then looking beyond 2021. Just curious on -- obviously 2020 was a pretty unique year to say the least. So just curious as you kind of move and turn the corner here, if you can give some comments on long-term margin potential as we think about the Dollar Tree and Family Dollar banner, given what's transpiring on the merchandise front and with all the new formats, what would be the timetable do you think to be able to navigate all the headwinds and perhaps return to some of the levels we've seen in prior years?
Kevin S. Wampler -- Chief Financial Officer
Paul, it's Kevin. I'll start and I'll let Mike chime in if he has anything. I guess I think about it in a couple of ways. One, one of the words you guys have all heard me use before and I think it's very true within our Company is continuous improvement. We go into every year expecting to improve in all aspects of our business. And whether that's driving sales, reducing costs, being a more efficient company. And so that's just the way our mindset is. And so, while I don't -- I don't have a timetable to give you in the sense of certain milestones as I sit here today, again, part of that is obviously the uncertainty of what's going on out there in the world with the pandemic and -- but we would expect continuous improvement. And I think Mike has shared a lot of that with all of you this morning and the idea. So we entered the year. The expectation is we're going to improve our operating income for both banners when we think about it. Whether we can do it with some of the things going on in the world, that's yet to be seen. But it's a great opportunity, and I think that's the most important thing is the way we always want to improve.
Michael A. Witynski -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Paul, I agree with Kevin that we will continuously improve and drive our pass on Family Dollar side. As you've heard me, we have not arrived yet. And there is upside because we just cycled through our first year, and we are going to continue to look at our assortment, our locations and improve upon the products that we have and price points. And I think on the Dollar Tree side, we have things ahead of us, just like the tariffs. Once we got it in front of us, we know how to manage around and it. And I would say that short-term, the freight thing, once we're aware of it, we're going to figure out how to mitigate it and grow the margin and grow Dollar Tree. Dollar Tree, for 14 years has had a quarter after quarter of positive comp store sales growth except for first quarter last year, and here we are cycling that right now this year. So yeah, I feel very strong that we continue to grow both sides.
Paul Trussell -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst
Thank you. And this year, you're opening up I believe it's 600 stores and remodeling like 1,250 Family Dollars or so. Is that in your mind kind of a good go-forward run rate or do you see a scenario where you guys may actually want to accelerate in the future given the different formats and opportunities that you have? And just any updates on long-term store count potential?
Michael A. Witynski -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, I'll comment and then you could go to Kevin there. But from my perspective, we will absolutely -- we're going to continue. We have 1,250 renovations this year. Next year, we believe there going to be another 1,250. But then the great thing about our balance sheet and our capital structure, it enables us to feed the growth and accelerate the growth. So, as we wind down the renovations after -- we'll add about -- this year and next year, then we can shift to total store growth. And then we've got these formats ahead of us that we feel very confident in growing. So yeah, I would see the -- an acceleration in new store growth as we round up or ramp up our 1,250 renovations for the next two years. Then we'll shift to new store growth.
Kevin S. Wampler -- Chief Financial Officer
Yeah, Paul. I think, to your point, total number of stores -- I think the most recent numbers we've given is Dollar Tree, about 10,000 stores and Family Dollar, roughly 15,000 stores. And again, I think we haven't updated those recently to the Street. It's something we're looking at. I think part of what plays into that and will be something we can maybe update in the future, the idea of stores continue to evolve and changes the way we think about what's, what that potential is, right? So as we -- as we talk today about the new combo store, we have to really look at the marketplace, and as we've said, I think that's 3,000 stores at a minimum at this point in time. So at some point in the future, we'll be able to achieve outtake that. But it's a great opportunity. To Mike's point, the balance sheet help support us in all things growth, and we're in a great place where obviously there are some retail space being vacated. The second-hand space has always been a big opportunity for us. And so that's another opportunity that allows us to grow at a good clip going forward.
Paul Trussell -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst
Thank you. Best of luck.
Operator
Okay. And it looks like we have time for about one more question. Looks like we have a question on the line from John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.
John Heinbockel -- Guggenheim -- Analyst
Hey, Mike. I wanted to start with strategic impact about the combo, right? So one, do you think it allows you get in the margin mix -- you get sharper -- if you need to on Family Dollar pricing, number one. And then secondly, can you take learnings from -- from new combo and put them into non-rural stores that may not overlap with Dollar Tree or are you pretty sensitive to that?
Michael A. Witynski -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Like I said, we're going to continue to learn and refine on all our formats and do whatever it makes sense to get the most productive and improve our margins and profitability of the banners that we have. What I'm really excited about is on the -- on this format as it -- these are small towns that we would not go into -- into the town with a Dollar Tree because the economics just don't support that. And we would go in with a Family Dollar. And what we -- what we said is, well, let's go in with the great part of Dollar Tree and bring in the seasonal and the party and the stationery and the Crafter's Square and all the things that small town America needs to celebrate their lines. And then on the Family Dollar side, it helps them live their lives and feed their families. So this combination store is really hitting on all cylinders from us because of the great mix and the great margin that provides and the overall productivity per store.
And to your further comment, we will continue to look at the categories that do well. And don't remember -- don't forget that in our H2s, we already have about 20 categories that have the Dollar items that we've brought into those categories from the Dollar Tree banner that really help bring that value program into those stores and are helping drive the H2 format as well. So we will continue to look at that, John.
John Heinbockel -- Guggenheim -- Analyst
And then maybe one follow-up to that, right, on how you source that product. What's the thought now right on the supply chain? And is this -- this push, the idea of hybrid DCs versus the one you have, does that accelerate that process?
Michael A. Witynski -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Well, we will always -- we are absolutely in a parallel path. To your point, we've got a great DC network and we are evolving that with trying to decide which -- what kind of format in our DC or -- we have a lot of trucks going by all these towns. So we're going to leverage 10 miles and leverage our distribution network to make sure we're driving the most efficiencies as we see these formats across the country. But you're right, that would lend well to Dollar Tree and Family Dollar product riding on the same truck to drive those efficiencies.
John Heinbockel -- Guggenheim -- Analyst
Thank you.
Operator
Okay. And we'll take another question from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Matthew Boss -- JPMorgan -- Analyst
Great. Thanks. So Mike, at the Dollar Tree banner, fourth quarter low-single digit comps overall basically match the concept historical run rate despite I know there was some volatility in there with December and January. So, as we think about the first quarter relative to the 2% to 3% comps in the fourth quarter, I guess overall any puts and to consider? And similarly for the full year, is any impediments to driving low single-digit comps in your view for the year at Dollar Tree?
Michael A. Witynski -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Overall, we don't see any structural or calendar impediment side. Last year with Dollar Tree, Easter, as you know, did not happen just because it was at the peak of the beginning of COVID. And it did two things that really impacted our first quarter sales at Dollar Tree and our margin at Dollar Tree because we didn't sell the high margin Easter goods. And then as you look throughout the year, I believe that as the country opens up and people get back to their routines and occasions start to begin to the increase inside the churches and schools and families and weddings and all those things that are great for Family Dollar business, I see some upside throughout the year.
And then, as you just heard, at Christmas, the 10 days or two weeks to Christmas because the COVID completely shut down and traffic. So yeah, I believe there is upside this year for Dollar Tree.
Matthew Boss -- JPMorgan -- Analyst
That's great. And then just a follow-up on gross margin at the Dollar Tree banner. I guess when we put together the anniversary of the first quarter headwind, I think you were down 250 basis points plus. And then we considered the freight headwind that you walked through. How should we think about Dollar Tree banner gross margin this year versus that 35% to 36% target range?
Kevin S. Wampler -- Chief Financial Officer
Yeah, I think a lot of puts and takes, as always, Matt, and I think, absolutely, as we've stated, the last -- last couple of quarters, we believe we can return to that 35 to 36 point range. I think the one development that probably hinders that a little bit here as we go into 2021 is the change in freight that is really a pretty new item to the first -- for the size of that I guess is where we speak to it. So again, I think, overall, I think there are things that I think -- our mix continues to be good. I think mark-on will continue to be good. I think obviously freight will be the big bad guy there. I think shrink would be helpful. And I think after a couple of years of distribution costs rising, I think maybe that could flatten out just a little bit. So there's many, many puts and takes, but I don't necessarily see it getting back to that above 35% in 2021. Right now with the freight headwind. It doesn't mean we can't get there, but it's a little bit of an uphill climb.
Michael A. Witynski -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, Matt, this is Mike. What Kevin said is -- what I am encouraged about is we just finished our January trip, which is our largest trip and we buy for the back half of the year. And our buyers did it remotely. But the value of the product, the excitement of the new product coming in for the back half of the year and the initial markup we're seeing on that product is exactly at our expectation. And then, as Kevin said, there is going to be some headwinds, but we'll figure out how to manage that, just like we did the tariffs. As long as they are ahead of us and we know what it is, we will manage around that. And then that -- and our mix is going to be favorable too at Dollar Tree as we -- the Crafter's Square. And as we grow the discretionary side of the business this year as the country begins to open up, that's the size that will benefit the most from this. And that's why I'm really excited about it.
As with shrink, as you know, for the last three years, shrink has been a headwind at Dollar Tree and Family Dollar. And last year, we improved it but we see some continued improvement in that area as well to help offset some other pressures.
Matthew Boss -- JPMorgan -- Analyst
That's great color. So interpretation is, just under 35% this year but you have visibility given the sourcing trips and the IMU that you're seeing to be back in that 35% to 36% just given [Indecipherable] is that kind of the best way to think about it?
Michael A. Witynski -- President and Chief Executive Officer
I guess the way to think about it, Matt, I think we've tried to describe the puts and takes the best we can. At this point in time, it's obviously very fluid, and we'll continue to update you on -- going to be very transparent this morning on all these items affecting us and we'll update you as we go forward.
Matthew Boss -- JPMorgan -- Analyst
Okay. Best of luck.
Operator
Okay. And it looks like we have time for one more question from Michael Lasser with UBS. Please go ahead.
Michael Lasser -- UBS -- Analyst
Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. So can you frame out the math a little bit that you provided? That was very helpful. So $279 million of COVID costs are going to roll off. You'll have $100 million [Indecipherable] that are going to be ongoing from the $25 million run rate that you provided for the fourth quarter. So that's a net $179 million benefit. At the midpoint of the incremental pressure you're feeling from wages and shrink, that's $137.5 million. So all else equal, nothing else happens, your sales are flat, you should have $41 million of additional operating income simply from the mix of those two factors. And as pointed out, can we -- can we then just kind of model out how we think sales are going to be and operating income would grow with sales putting aside that other math?
Kevin S. Wampler -- Chief Financial Officer
Well, I mean, obviously, the puts and takes that you talked to there, Michael, those are the numbers. And again, those are the big ones. There is obviously many things that happen in a given year. We're not giving specific guidance. I think [Indecipherable] this morning in every way possible. But again, I think you're right, the big items, I think -- we think we can offset and then there is plenty of other puts and takes at the end of the day. But we feel relatively -- we feel good about our business, we feel good about where we're going to be in 2021 and the opportunities ahead of us. And I don't know that I can give you a whole lot more guidance beyond that.
Michael Lasser -- UBS -- Analyst
Okay. I really just got several messages to make a counter argument to that math, which is although that's true except for Family Dollar is going to be down, potentially in the year ahead and we'll have to lap some unique benefits, so can we put in frame of reference around how we should think about what was unique to Family Dollar in 2019 that's really just not going to repeat? I know that's a big point of certainty, but I think [Indecipherable] and then I have one last follow-up on Dollar Tree Plus!.
Kevin S. Wampler -- Chief Financial Officer
I mean, Family Dollar -- I mean, you've heard us talk this morning about our initiatives, heard us talk about the opportunities that we have with the H2 and the combo stores. You've heard us talk about how we believe we are truly making a difference and building out our discretionary business. And that's a big -- it's not just big for sale, it's big for margin, it's big for customer satisfaction, return trips and all the things we do with that. So I think those are -- those are the things that we're working on hard day in and day out. I don't think anybody can truly project stimulus, how fast the economy will bounce back and all those things [Indecipherable] at the end of the day. So we feel good about where we're at. That's where we -- that's where we stand today.
Michael A. Witynski -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, Michael, I just want to reiterate the enthusiasm I have for both banners and where we're at with our formats, with the strategy that our merchants are working on, recycling last year's pandemic and again our capital structure. We are in the best position we've been in five years, and we've got a bright future. And our merchants are going to continue to do the things they do every day and get better, and we're going to keep growing the Company.
Michael Lasser -- UBS -- Analyst
Yeah. And this is very clear from the messaging you're providing today. That's helpful. And then my last follow-up is on the Dollar Tree Plus! Concept. You've stated that it's exceeding year plans. What's holding you back from rolling this out back to the 500 locations that you're currently in the process deploying to. And how does the overall financial performance of the Dollar Tree stores look in terms of sales, operating income dollars and margin? Thank you.
Michael A. Witynski -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. And again, we're going to -- that's why we're rolling it out to another 500 is continue this test. We had 120 stores and we bought seasonal items and items for the back half of the year and we exceeded the sales that we expected. So our customers are responding favorably. And what I've shared in the past is, we will continue to look at the overall store sales, the overall margin and the profitability of those stores, and those we want to see improve. And the top thing is with everything going on last year, everything I just described of COVID, it was really hard to lift our head up and say that the 10% of the store and the DT Plus really drive those things that I just described.
So we're going to keep testing and refining and rolling this out. But we like the results we're seeing so far.
Michael Lasser -- UBS -- Analyst
It's great to hear. Thank you so much and good luck.

2021-03-03 00:00:00+00:00,"Dollar Tree, Wendy's Q4 Revenues Miss Estimates",DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/dollar-tree-wendys-q4-revenues-miss-estimates-2021-03-03,,,"(RTTNews) - Dollar Tree Inc. (DLTR) Wednesday reported a profit for the fourth-quarter that climbed 309 percent from last year, while Wendy's Co. (WEN) posted a profit that grew about 46.0 percent from the prior year. Dollar Tree has increased its share repurchase authorization by $2.0 billion. Wendy's expects profit for fiscal year 2021 to be below analysts' expectations.
Dollar Tree's earnings per share topped analysts' expectations, but quarterly sales missed their estimates. Wendy's quarterly adjusted earnings per share and revenue missed analysts' expectations.
Dollar Tree said it did not issue updated sales and earnings guidance at this time, due to expectation of continued volatility and uncertainty related to the COVID-19 pandemic and other macroeconomic factors.
For fiscal 2021, Dollar Tree plans to open 600 new stores and to renovate 1,250 Family Dollar stores. The new stores are expected to consist of 400 Dollar Tree stores and 200 Family Dollar stores. The new Family Dollar stores will be comprised of H2 and Combination Store formats, based upon market locations.
Looking ahead for fiscal year 2021, Wendy's expects adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.67 to $0.69, global system wide sales growth of 6 to 8 percent, excluding the impact of the 53rd week. Analysts expect annual earnings of $0.72 per share.
In pre-market trade, DLTR was trading at $96.20 down $2.75 or 2.78 percent. WEN was trading at $20.58 down $0.72 or 3.38 percent.
Meanwhile, Dollar Tree reported that its fourth-quarter net income climbed 309 percent to $502.8 million from the prior year's $123.0 million, with earnings per share improving to $2.13 from $0.52 in the prior year's quarter. The fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 included several discrete charges. Excluding the discrete charges, earnings per share increased 19.0 percent, compared to the adjusted $1.79 last year. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected the company to report earnings of $2.11 per share for the fourth-quarter. Analysts' estimates typically exclude special items.
Operating income for the fourth-quarter improved 173 percent to $681.6 million, from $249.4 million in the same period last year. Excluding the goodwill impairment charge and the charge to the litigation reserve from the prior year's quarter, operating income margin improved 90 basis points from the adjusted 9.2 percent.
Dollar Tree's board increased the company's share repurchase authorization by $2.0 billion. The authorization has no expiration date. The company now has a $2.4 billion share repurchase authorization, combined with $400 million remaining on its prior authorization.
Consolidated net sales for the fourth-quarter increased 7.2 percent to $6.77 billion from $6.32 billion in the prior year's fourth quarter. Wall Street analysts had a consensus revenue estimate of $6.79 billion for the fourth-quarter.
Enterprise same-store sales increased 4.9 percent on a constant currency basis or 5.0 percent when adjusted to include the impact of Canadian currency fluctuations. Same-store sales for Family Dollar increased 8.1 percent. Dollar Tree same-store sales increased 2.4 percent.
Dollar Tree said it is combining Family Dollar's great value and assortment with Dollar Tree's ""thrill of the hunt"" and fixed price-point - creating a new strategic store format targeted for small towns and rural communities with populations of 3,000 to 4,000. These are markets where the company would traditionally not open a Dollar Tree store alone.
Moreover, Wendy's reported that its fourth-quarter net income rose 46.0 percent to $38.73 million from last year's $26.53 million, due to higher operating profit, partially offset by lower investment income as the result of a cash settlement related to a previously held investment that the Company received in the prior year.
On a per share basis, net income was $0.17 compared to $0.11 in the prior year. Adjusted earnings per share was $0.17 compared to $0.08 in the prior year. Analysts expected the company to report earnings of $0.18 per share for the quarter. Analysts' estimates typically exclude special items.
Operating profit for the quarter increased to $78.57 million from $36.72 million last year. The increase in operating profit resulted primarily from higher franchise royalty revenue and fees, lower franchise support and other costs related to the Company's investments in the prior year to support the U.S. system in advance of its breakfast launch, an increase in Company-operated restaurant margin, and lower reorganization and realignment costs. These increases were partially offset by an incremental Company investment in breakfast advertising of $6.3 million and higher general and administrative expense.
Revenues for the fourth-quarter grew about 11 percent to $474.32 million from $427.19 million in the prior year, driven by higher sales at Company-operated restaurants and an increase in franchise royalty revenue and fees. The increases were primarily driven by the impact of the 53rd operating week and an increase in same-restaurant sales driven by the company's new breakfast daypart in the U.S. Analysts expected revenues of $476.39 million for the fourth-quarter.
Adjusted revenue were $382.1 million up 11.8 percent from $341.7 million in the previous year.
Through the week ended February 21, year-to-date U.S. same-restaurant sales increased approximately 6 percent and Global same-restaurant sales increased approximately 5 percent.
