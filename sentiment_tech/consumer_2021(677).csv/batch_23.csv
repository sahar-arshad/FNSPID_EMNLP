While it doesn’t look like there are any immediate plans to integrate crypto and NFTs on eBay, the idea is being floated around. The company said as much about crypto in the following statement provided to Reuters.
“We are always looking at the most relevant forms of payment and will continue to assess that going forward. We have no immediate plans, but it (cryotocurrency) is something we are keeping an eye on.”
Adding to that, eBay CEO Jamie Lannon has also been talking about adding crypto or NFTs to the website. A recent interview on CNBC saw him talk about the possibility. You can see his statements below.
“We’re exploring opportunities on how we can enable it (NFTs) on eBay in an easy way. Everything that’s collectible has been on eBay for decades and will continue to be for the next few decades.”
PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) is among the companies that have started accepting cryptocurrencies as they continue to rise in popularity. However, there are a few restrictions that are worth noting about its system. You can learn more about that here.

So how is EBAY stock reacting to the news it might dip its toes into crypto and NFT? Not as strong as you might expect. The company’s only moved 5.9 million shares as of this writing. That will likely have it coming in close to its daily average trading volume.
When it comes to its share price, EBAY stock was up 2.9% as of Monday afternoon. It’s also up 11.5% since the start of the year.
More and more companies are starting to accept cryptocurrencies, which further legitimizes the digital assets.

2021-04-29 00:00:00+00:00,Why eBay Stock Got Crushed Today,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-ebay-stock-got-crushed-today-2021-04-29,,,"What happened
Shares of eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY) got crushed on Thursday after the company reported financial results for the first quarter of 2021. Q1 results were actually quite strong, but Wall Street didn't like the company's forward guidance. As a result, the stock was down 11% as of 10:15 a.m. EDT.
So what
For Q1, eBay's revenue grew to more than $3 billion, which was up 42% from the comparable quarter last year. And net income was even better, sporting a year-over-year increase of 45%. During the quarter, the company also generated $855 million in free cash flow (FCF), which was available for buying back shares and paying its quarterly dividend. For a company as mature as eBay, this was a stellar quarter.

eBay's platform surged in popularity as the COVID-19 pandemic confined people to their homes. It seems everyone started noticing things lying around and put them up for sale. For evidence, consider that there aren't that many more people on the platform than before. Active sellers were only up 8% from last year, and active buyers were only up 7%. But these eBay users have been far more active during the pandemic.
Now what
Modest user growth explains why eBay's outlook is tepid. As we move farther away from the coronavirus lockdowns, its business seems to be normalizing. Management is guiding for second-quarter revenue of $2.98 billion to $3.03 billion, which is 12% to 14% year-over-year growth. However, that's flat from Q1. This is why multiple Wall Street analysts downgraded their outlook for eBay stock this morning, according to The Fly.
However, consider that eBay has generated nearly $3 billion in FCF over the past four quarters, meaning the stock trades right around 12 times trailing FCF. That's a value stock in today's market and could be a good bargain if this company continues to make progress on new revenue-growth drivers like managed payments and promoted listings.

2021-04-20 00:00:00+00:00,2 Value Stocks That Will Make You Richer in April,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/2-value-stocks-that-will-make-you-richer-in-april-2021-04-20,,,"The S&P 500 index has surged to new highs in recent weeks, but some companies are not getting the love they deserve.
Hasbro (NASDAQ: HAS) trades at a modest valuation despite the catalyst for a return to growth this year. The toymaker has bright prospects within its digital gaming and entertainment segments.
It's a different story with eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY), which experienced a resurgence in its marketplace business during the pandemic. Despite eBay's soaring stock price, the current valuation leaves room for more upside if eBay's momentum persists, as management's near-term guidance seems to indicate.
Let's find out a bit more about these two value stocks that can make you richer in April.

1. Hasbro: Hoping to return to growth as the economy reopens
Hasbro is one of two leading makers of toys and games in the U.S., along with Mattel. Some of its top brands include Transformers, My Little Pony, Play-Doh, G.I. Joe, and Nerf, and it also produces classic table-top games like Monopoly, The Game of Life, and Magic: The Gathering.
Sales of Monopoly and Magic: The Gathering had their best year ever last year, but across the business, total revenue fell 8% in 2020. Even though Hasbro saw strong growth in the e-commerce business, retail store closures and production delays on its film and TV projects were too much to overcome.
The stock dropped 11.4% last year and is still trading below its 2019 high, but the share price may not stay at this lower level for long. The consumer products business should return to growth as the economy reopens, and initiatives in digital games, film, and TV could raise the toy maker's stature in the broader entertainment market.
Hasbro recently launched Magic: The Gathering Arena on mobile devices, as part of its strategy to spread its gaming brands to more platforms. The company's Wizards of the Coast and Digital Gaming segment grew revenue by 19.1% in 2020. The segment is now halfway to meeting its goal of doubling 2018 revenue by 2023.
Meanwhile, Hasbro has more than 200 projects underway across more than 30 of Hasbro's brands for film and TV. It is putting serious investment behind these projects, with two to three motion pictures and three to four TV shows planned for release by 2023 on major platforms, including Netflix, which ensures they reach a massive audience.
The Entertainment segment generated nearly $1 billion in revenue last year (less than 20% of Hasbro's business), but the 2019 acquisition of Entertainment One, which is taking the lead on these projects, positions Hasbro for long-term growth in the broader entertainment world.
Hasbro has rewarded investors with satisfactory returns and dividends for decades. But with the initiatives underway in games and film, it appears to be in an even better position to deliver returns coming out of the pandemic. The stock sports a modest price-to-free cash flow (P/FCF) ratio of 15 and pays an above-average dividend yield of 2.91%.

2. eBay: Transitioning to a new payment system for more growth
eBay's growth was slowing to a snail's pace in 2019, but then the pandemic hit. Traffic on the marketplace reached ""unprecedented"" levels, as CEO Jamie Iannone described on the fourth-quarter earnings call. The stock price is up 79% over the last year, but management has made major changes to the marketplace business that could result in better growth over the next few years.
It's transitioning its sellers to a new payment system that will offer buyers more payment options and potentially lead to higher conversion in the marketplace. Management expects the transition to deliver $2 billion in incremental revenue and $500 million in operating income starting in 2022.
Advertising is another big opportunity to drive incremental revenue growth. Sellers are seeing a double-digit sales increase when using promoted listings. For 2020, promoted listings grew 86% and translated to $1 billion in advertising revenue. eBay expects advertising revenue to continue outpacing gross merchandise volume for the foreseeable future.
eBay is also unlocking value in non-core assets. It is in the process of selling its Classifieds business to Adevinta (OB: ADE), a leading online classifieds marketplace based in Norway. In return, eBay will receive $2.5 billion in cash and a large equity stake in Adevinta. With this move, eBay bolsters its balance sheet and gains upside from the future growth in Adevinta's business. It also sold StubHub last year for $4 billion in cash and is currently exploring options for its Korea business.
Investors love the combination of growth initiatives, strong operating results, and transactions that beef up eBay's financial position. Management is guiding for revenue to grow between 38% to 40% year over year in the first quarter. That makes the stock look attractive at current levels, trading at a P/FCF multiple of 24 while offering a dividend yield of 1.02%.

Although no one can perfectly predict the market, the signs are there. The rising 10-year yield curve has made investors jittery about the possibility of capital moving away from stocks to bonds, and of the Federal Reserve having to increase interest rates. For a long time, high-growth companies have depended on cheap capital to fund their expansions. Facing the possibility of almost zero-interest capital vanishing, many investors are shifting their focus to value stocks.
However, high-growth stocks such as Shopify (NYSE: SHOP), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD), and Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ: ISRG) have robust balance sheets and solid structural trends. I wouldn't run away from these picks so soon.

1. Shopify
In 2020, Shopify accounted for 8.6% of the market share of U.S. retail e-commerce sales. Although far behind Amazon's leading market share of 39%, Shopify is still ahead of bigger players such as Walmart and eBay.
Shopify is not directly competing with any of these e-commerce players. Amazon and Walmart are focused on customers and on driving sales of their own products or third-party listings on their online marketplaces. Shopify's core focus is on providing merchants with tools to take their businesses online. The company also offers solutions to manage other aspects of retail business such as payments, capital, inventory and fulfillment, shipping, order management, marketing, and data analytics in a centralized fashion across all channels. Shopify's revenue stems from two sources: monthly tiered subscription payments from merchants and merchant payments for other customized solutions.
Pandemic-related e-commerce adoption and digitization of business have been the two most important growth drivers for Shopify in 2020. Although some amount of online spending could shift to brick-and-mortar channels after the pandemic, these trends will continue to transform the world for many years to come. Global retail e-commerce sales are estimated to grow almost 49% from $4.3 trillion in 2020 to $6.4 trillion in 2024.
Shopify had more than 1.7 million merchants on its platform at the end of 2020, a steep jump from its 1-million-strong merchant base at end of 2019. The rapidly expanding merchant base is attracting more developers and partners to Shopify's ecosystem, which in turn makes its platform sturdier, and thereby attracts even more merchants. This network effect has played a significant role in pushing up the company's revenue by 86% year over year to $2.9 billion and gross merchandise volume (GMV) by 96% year over year to $119.6 billion. The company also reported net income of $319.5 million in 2020, its first full year of profitability.
Shopify is trading at over 50 times sales, which is quite expensive. But because the company is helping so many businesses make a direct brand connection with their customers, I think it is still an attractive buy even at its current level. Shopify's retail strategy will assume a bigger role in future years, since Gen Z and millennials are increasingly opting for more personalized purchases. This is a multi-year opportunity, and can return rich returns to patient investors in the next decade.
2. Advanced Micro Devices
A darling of the stock market in 2020, AMD has mostly floundered in 2021. The culprits for the company's lackluster share price performance are losing some of its central processing unit (CPU) market share to Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) in the fourth quarter of 2020 and not being able to do much about it due to severe semiconductor shortages. While Intel designs and manufactures its chips, it is Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) that does most of the chip production work for AMD. With tight foundry capacity, AMD was unable to meet all demand in the fourth quarter.
However, these problems may be close to resolution. According to a Steam Hardware & Software survey, AMD's CPU market share for Microsoft's Windows operating systems increased from 25% to 28.97% from December 2020 to March 2021. At the same time, Intel's market share dropped from 75% to 71.02%. Although the survey only pertains to Steam gaming platform users, it highlights a trend in the overall CPU market, considering that Steam had 120 million active users globally in 2020.
AMD can also expect these production worries to ease, now that Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing has announced plans to invest $100 billion in capacity expansion over the next three years. With AMD being a prominent TSM client, these investments are bound to help the company.
Despite the many concerns, AMD's fiscal 2020 performance is quite encouraging, thanks to the company's focus on high-end CPUs and graphical processing units (GPUs), which are used extensively in the rapidly expanding gaming and data center markets. The company's revenue jumped 45% year over year, while net income more than doubled in 2020. Yet AMD is trading just over 10 times trailing-12-month sales, which is the lowest valuation for the company in the past 10 years. With a significant technological advantage over peers and gradually improving foundry capacity, AMD could prove to be an attractive investment for patient investors.
3. Intuitive Surgical
Leading robotic surgery player Intuitive Surgical's stock has gained just under 60% in the last year. This is especially commendable considering the pandemic caused hospitals to delay elective procedures, thereby reducing demand for the company's robotic da Vinci surgery system.
The company's fourth-quarter (ended Dec. 31, 2020) revenue grew by only 4% year over year, a significant decline from 22% year-over-year growth in the prior-year quarter. However, even the modest fourth-quarter top-line growth in such trying times is a testament to the success of the company's solid razor-and-blades business model.
Currently, there are 5,989 da Vinci systems installed across the world. So, although revenue from the sale of systems declined year over year by 12% to $1.2 billion, recurring revenue earned from the sale of instruments and accessories as well as service contracts increased by 6% year over year to $3.4 billion in 2020. Recurring revenue accounted for 77% of the company's total sales in 2020, which implies significant top-line visibility and low revenue volatility in coming years.
Intuitive Surgical is focused on expanding the type of procedures that can be performed with da Vinci as well as on expanding in international markets such as China, Taiwan, and India. The company also boasts the highest number of robotic surgery systems installed compared to the competition. Once surgeons and healthcare professionals are trained on one system, there are significant costs in terms of the learning curve and comfort level involved in switching to other systems. Each da Vinci system costs between $1 million and $2 million. Hence, it is not easy for hospitals to forgo such huge capital investments and switch to competing systems.
Trading over 21 times trailing-12-month sales, Intuitive Surgical is not cheap. However, considering that the company dominates the robot-assisted surgical systems market, expected to be worth $17.8 billion by 2027, there is much room for this healthcare stock to grow in coming years.

Jason Moser: Question from Jason Jackson, ""What are your thoughts on what Adyen is doing? Do any of you own shares?"" I personally do not. Not a business that I have dug a whole heck of a lot into, but I know it's one that is in our Foolish universe. But you got any thoughts on Adyen, Matt?
Matthew Frankel: I know the business really well. You're asking for thoughts on what Adyen is doing. If there is some recent news item, I might not be aware of it yet. They are a payment processing company. They're based in Amsterdam. They're truly global. The biggest visibility that they've gotten in the U.S. I'd say is when they took over as eBay's primary payment processor. Remember, eBay and PayPal have had that relationship forever. Adyen was the one that took that away from PayPal a few years ago. They made a lot of news doing that. I like the business, I like that they target big businesses and are really successful, like Microsoft is a customer, Etsy is an Adyen customer. There's a lot of big companies that are on their customer list. They have not really penetrated anything below the big companies in the market. Midsized businesses only make up about 2% of their payment volume right now. They're actively trying to get into that part of the business. If they are successful, there could be a lot of room to grow. Unlike Square and PayPal, Adyen is really an all-in-one payment processor, meaning that they do in-person payments, they do mobile payments, they do online payments. They provide omni-channel solutions. They provide debit cards. They want to give people no reason to use any other payment processor. For example, a lot of medium businesses in the U.S. are customers of both Square and PayPal. They would use Square for point-of-sale payments and PayPal for online payments. Adyen wants to give people no reason to do that. In terms of size, they're right between Square and PayPal. PayPal had about $1 trillion dollars of annualized payment volume in the last quarter. Square has a little over $100 billion, Adyen is in the $300 billion ballpark rather. They're between Square and PayPal, they're a big company, only about 20% of their revenue is from the U.S. Lot of room to grow. I like the company. I don't know of any recent news but I'm a big fan of theirs.

*Stock Advisor returns as of February 24, 2021
Matt Frankel: MercadoLibre is about 23% off its 52-week high as I'm speaking. But don't feel too bad for MercadoLibre shareholders like me -- the stock is still up 217% over the past year. Don't feel too bad for us. MercadoLibre I like for two reasons. We'll get into the reasons it fell in a minute, but it has two great businesses. It has its e-commerce marketplace, which is often referred to as the Amazon of Latin America -- if you've heard of it referred to like that -- and that business is growing fantastically well.
It's the leader in its marketplace. Sales on its e-commerce platform more than doubled year over year. It operates in places like Argentina, Brazil -- few other markets in Latin America that it's starting to really grow a presence in. Latin America, MercadoLibre's target market, has a population that's about double the size of the U.S. It did a lot of revenue on its platform. It did about $20 billion of merchandise sales on its platform in the past year. That is about 4% of what Amazon did. When you say that their marketplace is the Amazon of Latin America, it doesn't do the business justice. It would be like Amazon in 2007 or somewhere back then when it was in a much earlier stage of the business.
As if that weren't exciting enough, MercadoLibre has another side of the business, which is why it's on my radar -- the fintech side of the business called Mercado Pago. This is its payment-processing platform. Think of this like PayPal/eBay relationship. We know PayPal started its life as eBay's preferred payments processor. That's how it really gained traction; that's what it was known for. That was just the way you paid for things on eBay. Over the years, it grew. It started to build some off-platform businesses, they call it, where users would use PayPal in retail stores to pay on other websites, etc. This is what Mercado Pago is trying to do right now.
In the fourth quarter, I mentioned that MercadoLibre sold about $20 billion of merchandise on its marketplace in 2020. Mercado Pago processed payments at an annualized rate of about $60 billion in their fourth quarter. So it's gaining a whole lot of traction with these off-platform payments. It's the more exciting growth story of the business. I mentioned that MercadoLibre's e-commerce business has more than doubled year over year. That's the more boring part of its business. Mercado Pago actually increased payment volume by over 130% year over year, and off-platform payment volume grew by 150% in the fourth quarter year over year. That's pretty impressive. It's like an earlier stage PayPal/eBay relationship, where PayPal started to branch out, and over time, eBay became a drop in the bucket. I don't know if either the Brians remember a couple of years ago when eBay announced that they were dropping PayPal as their preferred payments processor. Did anyone care? No.
Brian Feroldi: But it really hurt PayPal, didn't it?
Frankel: Right. [laughs] Least of all. PayPal is an a all-time high. I think at the time, eBay made up about 6% of its sales at that point. The point is that it grew and grew its own entity and it really stood on its own. The payment volume is just really blown up off-platform, and it could be just the beginning. I could see it eventually getting to, like, a PayPal status where MercadoLibre is a significant but not a huge part of the revenue, where hopefully, they won't drop them as a payment partner. That's not where I see it going, but where it's really its own business and the dominant payment processor in its market. To put it in context, Mercado Pago, I mentioned, processed payments at a rate of about $60 billion annualized in their fourth quarter. PayPal's was over $1 trillion. It's like investing in Amazon, eBay, and PayPal all in one, all at much earlier stages of their growth cycle.

April 9 (Reuters) - Social media company Facebook Inc FB.O suspended 16,000 accounts for selling or buying fake reviews of products and services on its platforms, after the Britain's competition watchdog intervened for the second time, the regulator said.
U.S.-based Facebook also made further changes to detect, remove and prevent paid content which could mislead users on its platforms, including popular photo-sharing app Instagram, UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said on Friday.
""We have engaged extensively with the CMA to address this issue. Fraudulent and deceptive activity is not allowed on our platforms, including offering or trading fake reviews,"" a Facebook representative said.
The CMA began a crackdown on false reviews from 2019 when it first asked Facebook and e-commerce platform eBay Inc EBAY.O to check their websites after it found evidence of a growing marketplace for misleading customer reviews on the platforms.
Facebook has also been under scrutiny by the CMA for antitrust concerns over the technology company's acquisition of GIF website Giphy. It has been under pressure the world over for its data sharing practices as well as fake news and hate speech.
""The pandemic has meant that more and more people are buying online, and millions of us read reviews to enable us to make informed choices when we shop around. That's why fake and misleading reviews are so damaging,"" said CMA Chief Executive Andrea Coscelli.
CMA's crackdown on Facebook coincides with Britain's efforts to set up a dedicated digital markets unit within the regulatory authority to specifically look at governing digital platforms.

2021-04-07 00:00:00+00:00,Swiss luxury watchmakers learn to love the pre-owned market,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/swiss-luxury-watchmakers-learn-to-love-the-pre-owned-market-2021-04-07,,,"By Silke Koltrowitz
ZURICH, April 7 (Reuters) - Swiss luxury watch brands have long considered the market for second-hand watches as a potential threat to their business, but now their view is shifting as they see it can provide valuable insights into pricing and demand.
Initially seen as cannibalising sales of new watches, the market for previously owned or ""pre-owned"" watches has become the best place to assess the value of a watch over time and provide liquidity to watch owners who want to trade in their watch for a new one.
Richemont CFR.S, which owns Cartier, has so far been the only big luxury goods company to embrace the pre-owned market with its acquisition of online store Watchfinder in 2018.
Watchfinder has just launched a home collection service to make transactions easier during the pandemic.
Justin Reis, chief executive of pre-owned platform WatchBox, said the size of the pre-owned watch market was estimated at $16 billion and WatchBox's business was growing about 25% per year, including last year, when sales of new watches took a severe hit.
""We've seen so much in terms of new tailwinds pushing this sector. There's been a cultural change where people are more emphatic about collectibles,"" Reis told Reuters.
Reis said prices for popular Rolex, Patek Philippe or Audemars Piguet models had increased by around 25% and smaller independent brands like H. Moser & Cie, F.P. Journe or De Bethune were also gaining traction on WatchBox.
WatchBox and Watchfinder both set out as online platforms, but now also have some physical showrooms.
H. Moser & Cie head Edouard Meylan told Reuters demand for the brand's new watches had benefited from the ""good job"" WatchBox and peers were doing in the second-hand market.
""Some brands still try to fight this market instead of working with it,"" Meylan said. ""We monitor it almost day by day, it gives us indications on prices, on what we should produce,"" he said in an interview ahead of the Watches & Wonders virtual industry event launched on Wednesday. .
Watch brands like Audemars Piguet and established retailers like Bucherer have already started selling pre-owned watches, while eBay EBAY.O recently launched an authenticity guarantee for luxury watches sold on its marketplace.
Kepler Cheuvreux analyst Jon Cox, who estimated the size of the pre-owned market at close to $20 billion, said brands used to see the secondary market as a channel for discounted grey market products, but tighter controls had helped ease that problem with some pre-owned models now selling at a premium.
""This is a positive,"" Cox said. ""It is part of the change that ultimately can rejuvenate an industry that struggled for much of the last decade.""

2021-04-03 00:00:00+00:00,Looking to Invest Your Stimulus Check? 3 Surefire Stocks to Consider,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/looking-to-invest-your-stimulus-check-3-surefire-stocks-to-consider-2021-04-03,,,"Stimulus checks are showing up in people's bank accounts and creating a big temptation for those with steady incomes and ample savings to spend the extra cash. Yet investors know that they can achieve bigger returns in the future by passing on the instant gratification of buying a new gadget or home upgrade.
But which stocks are worth that trade-off?
Investing preferences differ, and many stocks seem like a stretch following a huge market rally since the start of the pandemic. But you're likely to look back in a few years happy you spent your stimulus check on Home Depot (NYSE: HD), eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY), or Domino's Pizza (NYSE: DPZ).
Image source: Getty Images.
Home Depot
Home Depot shares have barely kept pace with the 60% stock market rally in the past year. Rival Lowe's (NYSE: LOW) more than doubled its share price in that time.
Sure, Lowe's is closing the growth gap with its competitor, boosting sales 24% in 2020 compared to the market leader's 20% increase. Wall Street is also excited about the prospect for rising profitability as Lowe's operating margin marches toward Home Depot's 14% from its current 11%.
But Home Depot looks like a winner at today's prices. The home improvement retailer added $22 billion to its annual sales base last year despite shorter store hours and efforts to limit customer traffic during virus outbreaks. The relaxation of those pressures, plus Home Depot's big push into the professional maintenance niche, should allow it to win back some of the momentum that Lowe's captured in 2020.
Meanwhile, investors get a dividend that yields 2% today compared to Lowe's 1.2%. They also can expect quicker income growth since Home Depot returns over half of its annual earnings to shareholders through dividends while Lowe's pays out just about 35%.
Domino's Pizza
This past year was better for Domino's Pizza than for the wider restaurant industry. The world's leading pizza giant posted 10% higher revenue, including a double-digit spike in comparable-store sales. Yet Domino's stock has become cheaper since early 2020 as Wall Street worried about mounting competition in the home delivery segment. That concern was amplified by news that rival Papa John's (NASDAQ: PZZA) won some business from the market leader.
I still think Domino's will trounce the stock market over the long term. The pizza specialist runs amazingly efficient stores that, thanks to their carryout and delivery focus, require lower volumes to generate cash. That fact protects investors from some major restaurant-industry risks like overbuilding.
But the bigger reason to like Domino's is its track record for market share gains. Five years ago, it accounted for 29 % of U.S. home pizza delivery while today it owns 37% of that huge and growing niche. It's no surprise, then, that annual sales are up over 80% in that time.
PZZA Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts. TTM = trailing 12 months.
Look for the pizza leader to continue that streak over the coming years, pulling investors' returns up as well.
eBay
By handling over $100 billion of annual merchandise volume, eBay sits near the top of global e-commerce companies in market share. But its stock hasn't received nearly the same attention as Wall Street darlings like Shopify (NYSE: SHOP) and Wayfair (NYSE: W). That might change soon.
eBay's fiscal 2020 benefited from the same incredibly favorable demand trends that pushed sales higher for those other industry players. Sales jumped 20% even though management entered the year predicting near flat results. Yet eBay has some unique advantages over peers, including an asset-light selling model that routinely allows cash flow to cross 20% of sales a year. It produced $2.6 billion in free cash last year compared to $10.3 billion of revenue .
eBay is directing some of that windfall toward securing its bigger sales base in 2021. But there should be plenty left over for stock buybacks and dividend payments, both of which should amplify investors' returns. After a few years of compounding, these gains could easily dwarf your stimulus check.

It wouldn't make sense to pay that sort of premium for a more mature company like Coca-Cola or Walmart, which are already so large and successful that they can't grow very quickly.
Etsy is a different story, though. The company has averaged about 60% annual growth over the past three years, and analysts are forecasting more than 30% compounding expansion for the next several years. Hypothetically, a 30% earnings CAGR would lead to a 17.5 forward P/E ratio five years from now if the price never changes.
This is why popular valuation ratios such as price-to-earnings, price-to-book, and enterprise-value-to-EBITDA can't be applied to growth stocks in the same manner as to value stocks. A disruptive future industry leader could easily double or triple in size over the medium term, and bullish investors are more than happy to pay a premium on current fundamentals to own those future leaders. People who are optimistic about Etsy's trajectory assume that the company's coming earnings growth will be more than enough to push the stock price higher.

Etsy's place in the future of e-commerce
E-commerce has been a growing force in the retail landscape for more than a decade, and the impacts of the 2020 global pandemic accelerated that trend. Online sales jumped to more than 21% of total U.S. retail sales in 2020, up from 15.8% in 2019. As the fourth-most visited e-commerce site in the U.S., Etsy is in an excellent position to capitalize on this growth. Unlike competitors Amazon, eBay, and Walmart, Etsy has a more niche reputation as a destination for handcrafted and custom goods made by individuals. There are other product categories on the site, but Etsy still has a unique spot among the major e-commerce platforms. The company added 1.6 million active sellers last year, and its stellar performance with products such as face masks demonstrates the adaptability of both buyers and sellers on the site.
If vaccinations and herd immunity are effective in reducing COVID-19's impact on public health, we will likely see a leap in demand for brick-and-mortar stores. Early indications show that people are excited to return to normal, with pent-up demand for travel, experiences, and public activities. There's a chance that online sales will lose some share of the overall retail pie in the short term.
Regardless, last year's soaring e-commerce performance was the acceleration of an existing trend, and it's going to keep expanding over the medium term. Different retailers have invested more heavily in optimizing their digital channels, consumers are more comfortable than ever with shopping from home, and logistics are more efficient than ever.
There's every reason to expect that Etsy will grow along with the rest of e-commerce leaders. However, fragmentation might be an issue that drags on that growth rate. Solutions from companies such as Square and Shopify are making it easier than ever for smaller vendors and boutiques to service customers online. To deliver value for its sellers, Etsy will have to remain price-competitive or provide novel services that aren't matched elsewhere. There's a good chance that we'll see more and more small sellers staying independent. This dynamic won't be enough to dethrone the crafting giant in the next few years, but it's something for investors to monitor.
The verdict
It's not too late to get in on Etsy, but it's probably too late to expect the same magnitude of returns that the stock has delivered since its IPO. There's clearly room to run upward here, but a lot of future success is already assumed in the current prices, as evidenced by the aggressive valuation ratios.
If you love the company and believe in the model, you can buy it today without guilt or hesitation. There's a good chance that Etsy will outpace the market over the next few years. Just don't be shocked if the stock experiences volatility as the market and retail world rebalance to a post-pandemic equilibrium.
