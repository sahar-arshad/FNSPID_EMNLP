2021-09-24 00:00:00+00:00,"Where to Invest $10,000 Right Now",EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/where-to-invest-%2410000-right-now-2021-09-24,,,"Stocks dropped recently after rallying sharply through most of 2021. While that volatility might have you worried about an imminent pullback, the truth is, no one knows the timing (or duration) of the next downturn.
That's why it makes sense to regularly add to your portfolio through every market cycle. So, let's look at a few stocks that seem especially attractive right now if you're aiming to put a big chunk of cash to work today.
Read on for some good reasons to buy Lululemon Athletica (NASDAQ: LULU), eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY), and Disney (NYSE: DIS) stocks.

Lululemon Athletica is not a stretch
It's understandable if you're feeling late to the Lululemon Athletica growth story. The yoga-inspired apparel giant has trounced the market over the past three years and is up significantly since pandemic lows in early 2020.
But there are more market-thumping returns to come.
Lululemon tore past management's growth and earnings outlook in the most recent quarter, with sales gains accelerating to 28% on a two-year basis. That's nearly 10 full percentage points faster than the chain was growing before the pandemic struck.
Investors can't count on today's favorable selling environment to last forever. But Lululemon is winning market share through big improvements to its shopping experience, and through a steady stream of popular product launches.
These releases show that the chain can successfully push into new demographics like menswear, new niches like bras, and new geographies outside of its current North American focus. All those factors imply a significantly higher sales base in five years than the roughly $6 billion that Lululemon is expecting in 2021.
eBay delivers cash
eBay is a much better business than it was just two years ago. Sure, its soaring sales volumes are mostly tied to pandemic-related shopping changes that will lesson over the next few quarters. But the online marketplace has also divested weaker portions of its business, dramatically improved its buying experience, and built a bigger base of devoted shoppers. The proof of that success shows up in metrics like eBay's growing buyer pool and rising market share in niches like premium sneakers and watches.
Shareholders benefit from some unusually strong financial metrics, too. The asset-light operating model churns out cash, and the company's seller fees recently hit a new high of roughly 10% of sales. As a result, investors can expect to see rising cash returns through dividends and stock buybacks, even as eBay invests aggressively in expanding its market share.
Disney is a deal
Disney stock has been left out of the market rally so far this year, which creates a good opportunity for patient investors. Sure, the entertainment giant's finances are pressured by pandemic-related customer traffic slumps. Its theme park, film, and cruise line segments might take several more quarters before they're back to normal capacities.
In the meantime, Disney is building a formidable direct-to-consumer business that's blown past 100 million global subscribers. Its ability to bundle services like Disney+, ESPN, and Hulu (in addition to its use of on-demand pricing for new releases) give it some solid advantages over industry peers like Netflix. Put it together, and there's a high likelihood that Disney will be setting big annual sales records a few years from now.
While there are no guarantees in the stock market, buying these high-quality businesses gives investors exposure to attractive growth opportunities, rising earnings, and cash returns. Those assets should help you grow your initial purchase price faster than the wider market over time.

2021-09-23 00:00:00+00:00,Why MercadoLibre Stock Is a Smart Buy Right Now,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-mercadolibre-stock-is-a-smart-buy-right-now-2021-09-23,,,"MercadoLibre (NASDAQ: MELI) is the most popular online marketplace and digital payments platform in Latin America, which happens to be the fastest-growing region of the world in terms of e-commerce sales. Not surprisingly, long-term shareholders have made bank on this investment, as the stock price is up 485% over the last three years.
Even so, e-commerce and digital payments are still in the early days of adoption, and MercadoLibre has established a strong competitive position. In this Backstage Pass video, which aired Sept. 14, 2021, Motley Fool contributor Brian Withers shares why he is still excited about this tech company.

Brian Withers: I'm going to talk about MercadoLibre. For those who know me, you will not be surprised. It turned out when we were prepping for the show, everybody picked one of their regional e-commerce favorites, and nobody picked Mercado. I was like, sign me up. [laughs]
I was trying to provide you a little bit different information today. Here's some slides from its investor presentation it does every quarter. They have 140 million active users, a little bit different than the 500 million that we talked about with JD. But that number has grown every single time that they have published it. And I like this piece here down on the right. ""We are the leading technology company in developing e-commerce and payment solutions."" They didn't say, ""We're the leading e-commerce company."" They said, ""We're the leading technology company,"" and I'm going to get back to that.
Huge population in Latin America, 638 [million] -- considerably more than the U.S. They have more internet users in Latin America than there are in this population in the U.S., and actually, the online shopper number is really close to what the U.S. is, in around 200 million. They have 18 countries that they serve, but they don't serve all of their suite of offerings in all the countries, and I'll show you that.
This has been the business model for a long time. They started out focused on e-commerce, and like many of the other regional e-commerce plays, realized very quickly that they needed to have a payment solution because much of the commercial transactions in Latin America was cash. They had to develop a way for people to pay for goods online. That's what this Mercado Pago is over here, and they have Mercado Envios, which is shipping. Think of Fulfillment by Amazon, same deal. Mercado Credito, this helps both sellers get loans as well as cash advances for buyers. A little bit of potentially buy now, pay later opportunity. Mercado Shops is similar to Shopify, and it makes it easy for businesses in the region to set up their own web page within the MercadoLibre marketplace. We talked about payments here, and then a Publicidad here is advertising. They are also making money from advertising on the site. Lots of stuff going on here.
Here are the 18 countries on the left that MercadoLibre serves. The top three countries, which make up 62% of the population of the region, makes up 92% of the revenue. At one point, this was 95%, 96% or even more, so they've worked to broaden their revenue to different geographies throughout Latin America. You can see here's the population in millions. It's a little bit of a diminishing returns here as you get to smaller countries and more geographically spread out. But the e-commerce marketplace is available in every single region of the 18 regions.
Now, Mercado Envios, whether they have think of warehouses and forward fulfillment and things like that, it's in six different countries. Most recently, Chile and Colombia and Uruguay have been added. And I want to say these top five that they have free shipping, if you order more than $25 worth. That's another way that they are becoming more sticky.
Fintech is available in one more country, it's also available in Peru. And then Mercado Credito is available in the six places that have shipping, which make sense. The revenue for these three countries is growing at 90% year-over-year rate in the most recent quarter. Pretty impressive. But look at this 8% of revenue in these other countries, it's growing at 166%. So still from a small base, but the revenue growth in these regions is really big.
Then we'll look at it from a vertical standpoint. These two count for revenue in its e-commerce space, and that's about two-thirds of the revenue growing at almost triple digits. And then the fintech space is about a third of the business and it's growing at stellar rates as well. Any way you cut this thing is really big growth rates, really big opportunity, even in Brazil, Argentina, and Mexico. I know in Brazil and Mexico, it's doubling its fulfillment presence this year in those two countries and becoming even more deeply embedded with its shipping and fulfillment engines and hiring tons of people to help with its fulfillment business.
This is an interesting little slide. All of these acquisitions that it's made over the years, and there were a couple that they made that aren't even on this slide. But over time, it's been fairly acquisitive, and these have been small enough to where they haven't had to report the amount it was. This DeRemate was bought from eBay. I want to say it was the key auction site in Brazil, one of the countries, Brazil or Argentina. Then these classifieds. Think of your old newspaper classified service or the Craigslist stuff, and they've added to those based on these specific sites. One Logistics, there's another logistics acquisition, but this was the big one.
Then look at all of these down here. Think of all of this as software tech whatnot. I encourage you, check out this article. I was shocked when I looked at the amount that MercadoLibre spends on its technology, its IT. All of these companies that it bought also came with tech professionals along with the company, and they've kept most of these people. What they'll end up doing is partnering with one of these companies and then seeing how agile they are and if they would be a good fit with MercadoLibre brand. They do a try-and-buy, and then if they do well, they add them to the software suite. It has grown its information technology and product development piece about 10x over the last eight years. When they go back and say they're a tech company, I told you, there's a lot of evidence that supports that.
Amazing revenue growth, just tremendous. Look at this, almost double in the past year. The other thing that's happened, see this line, it's called take rate up to 19%. This is for every GMV, gross merchandise value, for every dollar sold on the website, MercadoLibre is now capturing $0.19 of it in services, fulfillment, advertising, you name it. Not only has the revenue grown, but they've been able to provide more value-added services for their sellers and buyers. Then over here, TPV stands for total payment volume. This is what they sold on the platform, $7 billion worth of goods, but with their payment services, more than double, so more than right about $10.5 billion of it is off-platform purchases. Their payments are being accepted around in local stores and restaurants and gas stations, and you name it. There's tons of growth levers. You can continue to grow the e-commerce space in all the Latin American markets. They continue to invest in their mobile business, they're working to expand their mobile business.
One of their most recent acquisitions was drop-off and pickup locations to help with that last-mile delivery piece. You can see all of these different things both on the fintech side and the e-commerce side that the company has tons of room to grow, even though it's been in business since 2004. Certainly, a well-run company with lots of opportunity ahead.

2021-09-22 00:00:00+00:00,"Surge in UK fraud a national security threat, warn banks",EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/surge-in-uk-fraud-a-national-security-threat-warn-banks-2021-09-22,,,"By Iain Withers
LONDON, Sept 22 (Reuters) - A surge in fraud attacks on consumers since the pandemic has become a 'national security threat' for Britain, requiring government-coordinated action across industries, banking lobby group UK Finance has warned.
Financial fraud has rocketed during the pandemic as more consumers shop online and try digital banking and investing.
The UK Finance warning came as British lawmakers on Wednesday criticised bosses at Facebook FB.O, Alphabet Inc's GOOGL.O Google, Amazon AMZN.O and eBay EBAY.O for not doing enough to prevent the spate of online scams.
Criminals stole 754 million pounds ($1.03 billion) through bank frauds in the first half of this year, up 30% on the same period in 2020, the lobby group said in a report.
Bank losses from authorised push payment (APP) fraud - where a customer is tricked into a payment by a criminal - also leapt 71% in the first half, overtaking the amount stolen through card fraud for the first time, UK Finance said.
Lenders have been pushing for tougher action on fraud by the government, regulators and other industries including online platforms exploited by fraudsters to target victims, as they grapple with a wave of increasingly sophisticated attacks.
The report found 70% of APP scams originated on an online platform and also found an increase in online adverts targeting people as young as 14 to become ""money mules"" for illicit funds.
UK Finance called for government-coordinated action across sectors and for all economic crime to be covered by a planned Online Safety Bill, which currently excludes online advertisements.
""The level of fraud in the UK is such that it is now a national security threat,"" Katy Worobec, managing director for economic crime at UK Finance said in the report. ""The banking sector cannot solve this on its own.""
'MAKING A MOCKERY'
Lawmakers on Britain's Treasury Select Committee told tech company bosses during a hearing on economic crime that the problem had got out of hand, accusing them of enabling fraud.
""Google's made a mockery of the regulator of this country, by expecting the regulator to take down fraudulent stuff on the site, and have to pay for it,"" lawmaker Rushanara Ali said.
Google has offered the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), Britain's regulator, $1.5 million in advertising credits to help cover the cost of fraud awareness campaigns.
""We want them to take up those ad credits,"" Amanda Storey, Google's director of trust and safety for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, said. The tech firm intends to offer $3.5 million of advertisement credits to other scam awareness campaigns.
Google has prohibited investment ads that are not FCA-authorised - including for gold and cryptocurrencies - since Sept. 6 this year, Storey added.
The tech firms said they were investing in fraud prevention and collaborating with the government and regulators.
""We're actually the first line of defence, rather than an enabler,"" Gaon Hart, head of public policy for customer trust at Amazon UK & Ireland said.
Neither Google nor Facebook were able to say if they had ever compensated customers for losses from fraud, though Amazon said it had.

2021-09-21 00:00:00+00:00,September Sell-Off: These 3 Growth Stocks Just Went on Sale,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/september-sell-off%3A-these-3-growth-stocks-just-went-on-sale-2021-09-21,,,"The stock market's volatility in recent days has been a reminder that more or less steady long-term capital gains are often interrupted by periods of quick declines. As the old saying goes, ""Stocks take the stairs up, but the elevator down.""
Investors can ignore short-term slumps for the most part -- except if they're hunting for bargains. With that idea in mind, let's look at three attractive growth stocks, Target (NYSE: TGT), Garmin (NASDAQ: GRMN), and eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY), which have fallen from all-time highs and might represent even better buys today.
Image source: Getty Images.
1. eBay
eBay handles enough merchandise volume to make it one of the biggest e-commerce retailers on the planet. However, its middleman selling approach makes it much more financially efficient than its peers. The marketplace giant routinely generates over $3 billion in operating cash, or well over 30% of sales, for example.
Its growth rate has been impressive since the pandemic struck, which doesn't separate it from rivals such as Walmart and Amazon. But eBay is winning share in some key niches that its buyers love. For instance, its collectible sneaker and luxury watch categories are booming.
eBay's margins are rising as it finds more ways to add value for its sellers, which, in turn, allows it to raise transaction fees. That fundamental profit metric recently crossed 11% of sales, in fact.
Investor returns from here should continue to be lifted by those gains and by eBay's stock buybacks and dividend. The stock's roughly 7% decline in recent days might not be the end of its pullback, but it has made the stock more attractive.
2. Target
Target is sitting about 8% below the all-time highs the chain set in mid-August. And sure, there are some reasons to worry about a potential growth slowdown. Shipping bottlenecks might pressure earnings in the second half of 2021, too.
But this business has to date given investors no reason to think its business is losing momentum. Comparable-store sales grew 9% in the second quarter, on top of the record 24% spike a year ago. Target is still gaining market share in areas like home furnishings and consumer electronics, and shoppers are thrilled with the tight integration between its online and in-store selling channels.
Yes, Target is still far more expensive than peers like Costco and Walmart. There's a good reason for that premium, though -- it's holding on to more of its revenue as operating profit. The chain is bumping up against 10% operating margins, which is double Walmart's and roughly three-times Costco's comparable figure.
TGT Operating Margin (TTM) data by YCharts.
That success alone should be enough to keep Target on your watch list during stock price downturns like these.
3. Garmin
Garmin shares are down about 7% from all-time highs set in late August. That's an admittedly modest discount for a stock that's still trouncing the market so far in 2021.
However, the navigation-device giant is having a banner year, even following soaring growth in 2020. Sales gains accelerated last quarter and are booming across segments ranging from smartwatches to marine navigation. Margins are climbing toward 30% of sales, putting it in the same league as Apple.
Garmin would suffer from an economic growth slowdown, should one hit in late 2021. But right now, the business is on track for another big sales year, along with rising margins, thanks in part to a flood of innovative tech releases.
You could wait to see if this stellar business becomes more attractive through further price declines. Or you could take advantage of the recent discount and start a position in this growth stock today.

2021-09-21 00:00:00+00:00,Market Sell-Off: Time to Buy PayPal?,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/market-sell-off%3A-time-to-buy-paypal-2021-09-21,,,"PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL) dropped by close to 2.5% in Monday trading amid a generalized sell-off. Since its spinoff from eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY) in 2015, the fintech's stock price has surged more than 625% amid the rising prevalence of financial technology, even after a 13% drop from highs set earlier this year.
Financial technology is vast in scope, and has already attracted numerous PayPal competitors to the field. But it may be this new decline that leads investors to ask whether the falling stock price is a reason to sell or a buying opportunity.

The state of PayPal
While the slight drop in the stock on Monday may have piqued the attention of a few worrisome investors, they can't deny the strength of PayPal's growth story. PayPal led the way for the fintech industry in the 1990s, allowing users to make payments from their computers.
Despite this longtime presence, the company could easily continue its expansion for the foreseeable future; Grand View Research forecasts a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) for global fintech of 19% through 2028. This will take the size of the industry to an estimated $236 billion globally. As societies go cashless, sites like PayPal have offered more services, increasing options for making payments electronically.
Additionally, Venmo, PayPal's peer-to-peer payments app, has become an increasingly popular option that allows users to spend and collect money, performing transactions with individuals and businesses without needing a wallet or a credit card. And PayPal just bought Paidy, a Japanese buy-now, pay-later (BNPL) company, for $2.7 billion. Paidy is the leader in BNPL in Japan, which has the third largest e-commerce economy in the world.
However, while PayPal went into BNPL before Square (NYSE: SQ), in areas like crypto and app-linked cards, PayPal seems to merely react to this peer's moves. Square's ecosystem, which now includes an industrial bank, poses an increasingly serious threat, as many businesses can now conduct all the necessary financial transactions inside the Square ecosystem. Currently, PayPal does not offer traditional banking services. Hence, it would require businesses to link an external account in order to move money outside of the Venmo or PayPal ecosystems.
Moreover, Square's Cash App is almost as big as Venmo. Cash App, which competes directly with Venmo, claims 70 million users, just under the approximately 76 million active accounts Venmo reported at the end of Q2.
PayPal's presence in 200 countries means only so much given that in developing nations, many people do not use credit or debit cards. This makes PayPal inaccessible to many in cash-based societies. In such countries, PayPal operates at a disadvantage to a company like MercadoLibre (NASDAQ: MELI), which offers services that allow cash-only customers to access fintech services.
PayPal cashes in on fintech
So far, PayPal's challenges do not seem to have slowed growth. For the first six months of 2021, revenue of $12.3 billion surged 24% compared with the first half of 2020. Over the same period, net income rose 41% to $2.3 billion as expenses climbed by only 18% and PayPal received an income tax benefit in Q1. This made up for lower net gains on investments that reduced other income by 92%.
For fiscal 2021, the company expects revenue of nearly $26 billion, which would amount to an increase of nearly 20% versus fiscal 2020. Still, PayPal began to drop following this announcement as investors reacted negatively to eBay's shift away from the PayPal platform. Nonetheless, While PayPal stock has surged by more than 50% over the last 12 months, it's P/E ratio has fallen to around 65, closer to pre-pandemic levels. Meanwhile, Square shares trade for almost 220 times earnings.

Is PayPal worth considering?
Although any drop in the stock price may foster some investor anxiety, it appears that concerns including competitive threats and a general weakening of confidence in the market have driven the decline. Admittedly, Square's ecosystem and Cash App have become a notable competitive threat. Moreover, PayPal may have to compete more directly with the likes of MercadoLibre in countries that are still bringing banking and financial services to the mainstream.
Nonetheless, the overall fintech industry continues to expand rapidly, and PayPal still stands to benefit. Revenue and a rising stock price indicate that the company can deliver for both customers and investors. Over the next few months, investors should look to a falling stock price with a cautiously optimistic eye: I think this sell-off points to opportunity rather than adversity.

2021-09-21 00:00:00+00:00,eBay Stock Is on Fire: What Smart Investors Should Know,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/ebay-stock-is-on-fire%3A-what-smart-investors-should-know-2021-09-21,,,"E-commerce and auction site eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY) is on fire in 2021. The company gained a record number of customers at the pandemic's onset as people avoided shopping in person.
eBay is using this momentum to optimize business performance. Management expects many of the buyers who signed up during the pandemic not to stick around long term, so it's focusing on retaining high-value customers. That's one of a few things investors should know about eBay as the stock races higher.

Making the most of it
At the pandemic's onset in eBay's second quarter of 2020, the company added seven million active buyers, the most in ever in the company's history. eBay continued to add buyers throughout the next year, but that trend reversed itself in the most recent quarter. Economic reopenings have led consumers to spend more time away from home. Unsurprisingly, fewer shoppers turned to eBay, and as a result, the company shed seven million active buyers between the first and second quarters of 2021.
Still, at 159 million strong, active buyers are up 3% from the same quarter in 2019. Moreover, eBay has made some changes in its promotional activity to target higher-value customers, so while the total count is shrinking, the quality of buyers has improved. Here is what management said on the matter in the latest earnings call:
In parallel, we've discontinued legacy tactics that led to low-value, infrequent, or one-and-done buyers. Our buyer base is starting to evolve based on this strategy. These high-volume buyers are growing compared to a year ago, and their spend on eBay is growing even faster. This higher-quality mix of buyers increases value for sellers and will lead to improved health of our ecosystem over the long term.
Indeed, even though eBay lost overall active buyers quarter over quarter and year over year, it gained high-value buyers who also increased their spending during the period. These VIP customers make up 20% of eBay's buyer total but account for 75% of total purchase value. That is in stark contrast to low-value buyers who make up half of the total but contribute only 5% of gross merchandise volume. This new focus will be crucial for the company, because it generates revenue by taking a percentage (the take rate) of the overall transaction volume on its platform.
eBay has also migrated its buyers and sellers to its own payment system. The transition helps streamline the selling process and reduces the delay when buyers make a purchase and pay.
The combination of reduced promotional activity and payment migration increased eBay's take rate to 11.3% in the second quarter, up from 9.2% in the year-ago period.
What this could mean for investors
These latest changes can improve long-term profitability for eBay, boosting what has already been an excellent operating margin over the last decade.
Data by YCharts.
The market seems impressed as eBay shares have gained 45% so far this year. Management is confident enough in its prospects to increase its stock buyback target for this year from $2 billion to $5 billion. Savvy investors should take notice and put eBay on their list of stocks to watch.

Image source: Getty Images.
PayPal: It's still early innings for the digital payments revolution
Danny Vena (PayPal): In the realm of digital payments, PayPal was the pioneer that started it all. The company made e-commerce practical by introducing an online payment system to the masses -- which is still widely used today -- as well as having bragging rights to the first widely used digital wallet.
Since the company's much-publicized divorce from eBay in 2015, PayPal has made a host of moves to expand its existing business, partnering with the biggest banks and credit card issuers in the industry to ensure that its customers can use any payment method at their disposal without ever leaving the PayPal app.
Then there's the emerging peer-to-peer (P2P) payment systems space, and no discussion about the most popular entrants would be complete without a nod to PayPal's Venmo. The app, which began as a way to send money to friends or split a bill at a restaurant, has evolved to represent a growing digital payments platform that can also now be used to pay retailers and other merchants.
Many investors have classified PayPal as a COVID-19 play, linking the company's growth to the onset of the pandemic, but history proves otherwise. In 2019, before the pandemic, PayPal delivered a record-setting year across many metrics, including revenue, net income, and operating margin.
That said, there's little doubt the pandemic accelerated an already robust trend toward touchless payments and digital wallets, a space that PayPal absolutely dominates. The company saw the opportunity and pounced.
Last year, PayPal built on its record 2019 by delivering the strongest performance in the company's history. It added a whopping 72.7 million net new active accounts, which pushed its total payment volume (TPV) of $936 billion up 31%. These strong fundamentals resulted in revenue that grew to more than $21 billion, up 21%, and generated profits that grew 71%.
If you think PayPal's growth engine is out of gas, think again. During the second quarter, the company added 11.4 million new accounts, which in turn drove TPV of $311 billion, up 40% year over year. This translated to net revenue of $6.24 billion, up 19%, and adjusted profits that climbed 8%. Not bad, considering the tough comps PayPal faced in the wake of its back-to-back record-setting years.
Financial technology and digital payments are only just getting started, and while PayPal is the clear leader, its execs believe this is just the beginning. ""Our aspiration is to have a billion people on our platform,"" CEO Dan Schulman told attendees at an investors' conference early last year. With 403 million current users, those seemingly pie-in-the-sky aspirations aren't that far off.

Qualcomm: An essential 5G chip stock investors should not forget
Will Healy (Qualcomm): Apple's upcoming release of the new iPhone should draw interest back to the smartphone market and, by extension, to Qualcomm. For all of the efforts to develop its own chip, Apple and its smartphone competitors remain dependent on Qualcomm and its massive portfolio of wireless patents to produce their premium devices.
Qualcomm has benefited from a massive 5G upgrade cycle. Grand View Research forecasts a compound annual growth rate for this industry of 69% through 2028, taking the industry's value to over $66 billion by that year.
Notwithstanding this opportunity, Qualcomm faces some uncertainty regarding its dependency on Arm Holdings. Arm licenses low-power chips to Qualcomm that go into 95% of all premium smartphones, so Nvidia's move to acquire that company has caused deep concerns. Not surprisingly, Qualcomm has spoken out against this deal, and the U.K. has delayed approval, citing concerns about competition. Such hold-ups dramatically increase the chances the takeover will not occur, thus bolstering Qualcomm's competitive advantage and possibly, its stock.
Also, even with this uncertainty surrounding Arm, Qualcomm earned revenue of $24.2 billion for the first nine months of fiscal 2021. This is an increase of 60% compared with the same period in 2020. Earnings rose 179% during that timeframe to $6.2 billion as its total costs grew at a slower pace.
For Q4, the company forecasts between $8.4 billion and $9.2 billion in revenue, a 5% increase from year-ago levels at the midpoint. However, the 2020 figures point to a frontloading of Qualcomm's revenue growth since the company benefited from a combination of Apple's first 5G iPhone release and higher chip sales amid the COVID-19 pandemic. This strengthens the likelihood that revenue increases will return to double-digit levels as the pandemic weighs on the economy less.
Qualcomm may not fully reflect this potential -- the stock rose by just 22% over the last year. Moreover, its P/E ratio of 17 seems low, even if revenue growth temporarily slows into the single digits. Its valuation remains well under Apple's earnings multiple of 29 and Nvidia's 80 P/E ratio.
The low multiple could persist for a time as the status of Nvidia's Arm acquisition could continue the uncertainty in the near term. However, as new phone updates introduce more consumers to the 5G world, Qualcomm stock should begin to see more benefit as the upgrade cycle continues.

Twilio: More than just a messaging platform
Brian Withers (Twilio): Twilio is probably best known for the messaging service that Uber built using its platform. The capability for riders and drivers to easily and privately message each other was key to making a great user experience for Uber users. The company has come a long way since then. Although messaging is still a core capability, Twilio has added so much to its suite of products. It is likely that the market may be underestimating the long-term potential of this winner. Before we dive into the details of its massive market, let's take a look at the most recent results.

Although the revenue numbers in the table above include the contribution from Twilio's Segment acquisition, organic growth is coming in at a stellar 55% year over year for the most recent quarter. In addition to solid growth, investors love that the company continues to land customers at a rapid pace, and gets them to consistently expand their spending over time.
But the company isn't done growing by any means. It has been working hard to expand its total addressable market and increase its optionality. In 2017, it estimated its addressable market as $45 billion. Today, with additional capability and demand accelerating for its technology, its 2023 expected TAM is now $110 billion. The company splits this into seven substantial subgroups. The three largest groups represent $23 billion to $25 billion markets separately: email and marketing campaigns, API (application programming interface), and its customer data platform. These large addressable markets give Twilio plenty of room to grow for many years to come.
Between its execution success and its massive addressable market, Twilio's stock carries a premium valuation of 25 for its price-to-sales ratio. This might scare away value investors, but for those interested in a long-term growth story, adding $500 to this stock today could prove to be a lucrative decision.

*Stock Advisor returns as of August 9, 2021
Matt Frankel: It's called Matterport. Ticker symbol is MTTR, recently went public via SPAC merger because it's 2021, why not?
Lou Whiteman: Of course.
Frankel: Matterport, like you said, I always think of the Disneyland ride Matterhorn when I hear the name. This is what they call a spatial data company. Matterport is the best in the business when it comes to technology that can create a 3D map of the inside of a building. For example, they partner with Redfin (NASDAQ: RDFN) to provide 3D tours for their listings, Airbnb (NASDAQ: ABNB) to provide insight views of properties for them. So Matterport is pretty much the pioneer in this market. They'll say they have over 100 times the market share of all their competitors combined, and it's true, but it's because they don't really have any competitors.
Whiteman: Percentage gain, yeah.
Frankel: But Matterport does have some hardware. They have a 3D mapping camera that's the best you're going to find. It's like a $3,000 camera, the Matterport Pro2 it's called. But the real potential in this business is they sell it as a Software-as-a-Service model. The idea is the more buildings around the world they can have 3D maps or digital twins as they call them, the more valuable this becomes the software product. How big could this get? The company has mapped about 15 billion square feet of space so far. That includes homes, offices, commercial properties. They have about 250,000 subscribers, 150 companies around the world. That is 18 times as many as they did two years ago. Growing very, very fast, this is really catching on. A lot of Fortune 500 companies are Matterport users. They don't all pay for it. There's a free version, it's a freemium model. So if you just want to be able to look inside one building, that's a free membership. 3D maps of homes are just one use case for this. Because you might be asking, why would I pay for that when I can just go to Redfin or go to Airbnb or go to Zillow and see the inside of the home I want to see if there's already a Matterport map of it? That's only one use case. Where Matterport really has potential, it's things like helping developers renovate a property without ever having to go in it, figuring out the most efficient use of space without having to be there. If you're an interior decorator, there's only so much you can do if you walk in and take a picture of someone's living room. Having a 3D map, it's essentially like being there. It takes your business to another level. Contractors is a big one. Insurance companies. How much of an advantage would a company have underwriting a property if you could see every little nook and cranny on the inside of it? A lot of potential here. Matterport's growing really, really fast. Founded by former Google (NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) executives, former Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) executives, former Chief Product Officer of eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY) is one of their executives. Really, really big market. Like most SPAC IPOs, take their addressable market with a big grain of salt. Let me see if I have the number in front of me. It's, let's say, a reach. They're saying that they have a $1.2 trillion addressable market. That seems a little bit of a reach. They arrived at it this way. There's an estimated 4 billion properties worldwide. Throughout the world, 4 billion buildings. Almost one for every person. Less than 1% of it has been digitized on the inside. Even less has been digitized to the quality of Matterport's standards. They're saying that just with its current business, not including any adjacent opportunities, that's a $240 billion addressable market if they can map 100% of the world's buildings. They're not going to get there.
Whiteman: No.
Frankel: It's just not going to happen.
Whiteman: Yeah.
Frankel: But if they can get 1% of their addressable market opportunity, that's a $2.4 billion revenue opportunity. That's a pretty big deal for a company of that size. Really interesting business, new technology. What do you think?
Whiteman: Well, there's no reason why all of the world's buildings, especially with the pay to do this, there is certainly that 1% number. There is good reason why some business is worth. It's funny, when I first saw them come out as a SPAC, all I could think of was when we renovated our kitchen and how much I would've paid, if not the contractor paid, to just have someone to come in, do that and show us what we could do and all. I think the construction applications, maybe on small-scale, but there's a lot of incremental small revenue to be made there. This is in a way the biggest company we're talking about and in a way the smallest because their market cap, I guess it's a little shy of Howard Hughes (NYSE: HHC), but their annualized revenue run rate is just north of $100 million. This is early days.

2021-09-18 00:00:00+00:00,Is GameStop's Big Growth Investment Good News for Shareholders?,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/is-gamestops-big-growth-investment-good-news-for-shareholders-2021-09-18,,,"GameStop (NYSE: GME) is best known for its inclusion in the 2021 meme stock frenzy whipped up by Reddit investors. Shares of the once stagnant gaming retailer skyrocketed due to the online community WallStreetBets collectively committing to buy and hold the stock in order to sabotage short sellers' positions.
GameStop's stock represents an underlying business, and that business is deteriorating. Over the years, the company neglected the rapid shift to digital game sales and its brick-and-mortar business suffered. Is it good news that management is finally investing in strategic growth initiatives?

Changing course
In its fiscal second-quarter earnings release, executives highlighted long-term investments they're planning: Expanding its product catalog, enhancing its fulfillment network and technology, and hiring new talent.
Its surging stock price allowed management to raise enough cash to pay off all its long-term debt and have $1.78 billion in cash left over. GameStop's most recent stock sale completed in June netted the company $1.1 billion for 5 million shares sold. And its debt levels are $424 million lower than the same time last year.
After three years of falling revenue and consistent losses instead of profitability, GameStop has to do a lot of rebuilding. On the surface, the new initiatives align with changing consumer tastes, which has shifted toward e-commerce.
One way GameStop can differentiate itself is to have a robust catalog of titles so gamers can purchase multiple titles with ease, particularly when seeking used games. Instead of waiting for other gamers to list used games on eBay, customers could go to a one-stop shop with confidence.
Investing in the fulfillment network could bring its 'order to delivery' times on par with the market. GameStop leased a 530,000 square foot fulfillment facility in Reno, Nevada. The move will improve its shipping times in the West Coast region. Amazon has conditioned consumers to expect fast and free shipping and customers are quick to change where they shop based on delivery speediness.
Further, GameStop is opening a customer care center and bolstering its Florida staff to improve customer service. That's in addition to hiring folks with experience in e-commerce, supply chain, user interface, user experience, and operations.
While GameStop is investing in these projects, it's also shuttering its lowest-performing stores. In 2018, about 83% of video games were sold in digital form, according to Statista, signaling the lack of demand for stores to carry physical inventory. The trend was exacerbated during the pandemic and in 2020, 91% of game industry revenue was digital. The company's brick-and-mortar locations decreased worldwide by 9% in the last 12 months, which allowed the company to free up its cash flow. Hopefully, rightsizing its footprint could bring the company closer to profitability.
Could this turnaround pay off for investors?
GameStop stock is trading at $205 today, but the company has not generated positive earnings per share (EPS) for three years. In 2018, the last time earnings were positive, the company earned $0.34 per share. This means the stock is trading for 597 times 2018's EPS. The company's best year over the last decade was in 2016 when it earned $3.78 per share. The stock is trading at 54 times its best earnings year in the past decade.
GameStop's exorbitant valuation is the result of the Reddit meme investors' fixation on what has become a battleground stock between retail investors and hedge funds. The WallStreetBets investors don't care about the company's fundamentals but are focused on creating a short-squeeze to deliver their returns. Ultimately, it's an investment fraught with danger for regular investors seeking long-term growth.
If you care anything about valuations, you will stay away from this stock -- at least until this new strategy starts to bear fruit.

(Symbol: EBAY) have crossed above the average analyst 12-month target price of $72.80, changing hands for $73.99/share. When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher — if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.
There are 15 different analyst targets within the Zacks coverage universe contributing to that average for eBay Inc., but the average is just that — a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $63.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $85.00. The standard deviation is $8.334.
But the whole reason to look at the average EBAY price target in the first place is to tap into a ""wisdom of crowds"" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with EBAY crossing above that average target price of $72.80/share, investors in EBAY have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $72.80 just one stop on the way to an even higher target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table?

2021-09-14 00:00:00+00:00,Why Fading Fiscal Stimulus Is Less Harmful to eBay Than Amazon,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-fading-fiscal-stimulus-is-less-harmful-to-ebay-than-amazon-2021-09-14,,,"As the coronavirus brought parts of the economy to a standstill, legislators in the U.S. enacted trillions of dollars in fiscal stimulus. The idea was that the pandemic would hurt many people's businesses and millions would lose jobs, so government assistance was necessary to prevent the economy from going into a tailspin. The efforts were a lifeline to folks who lost their jobs -- and to those who were fortunate enough to keep their jobs, it helped increase savings accounts and pay for a few luxuries.
But now as the economy reopens, much of that fiscal stimulus is not getting extended. Early in September, enhanced unemployment benefits of as much as $300 per week came to an end. And the effects of the last stimulus checks, which were sent months ago, are fading away. What's left is a consumer who will be less flush with cash and make more budget-conscious purchase decisions.
Here then is why eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY) stands to experience less of a negative effect than Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN).
Image source: Getty Images.
eBay has an easier selling process
While eBay and Amazon allow outside individuals and businesses to list products on their platforms for sale, eBay makes the process easier for small-time sellers. For instance, someone who wants to sell a couple of used shoes in good condition every once in a while will not open an Amazon seller's account. The process is too onerous to make it worth the time.
The same person can have the item listed for sale on eBay within a few minutes and clicks. Therein lies a major benefit for eBay as consumers' pockets get skinnier with fewer stimulus dollars. Folks looking to raise some cash could look to eBay to sell goods they no longer want or need.
On the flip side, folks feeling less wealthy as economic stimulus fades could increasingly look to lower-cost, used versions of the items they want. Instead of buying the newest iPhone from Apple, they may look for a used, older model on eBay. Instead of buying a new version of the Sony PlayStation 5, they might look to eBay for the previous model. In any case, these trade-off decisions where consumers choose the lower-cost option are not as frequent when bank accounts are flush.
Moreover, eBay has a robust list of items for sale through an auction where consumers bid against each other. If consumer income decreases, items can be had for lower prices than if consumer income is booming. The effect could feed a virtuous cycle where lower prices then attract more buyers.
Amazon faces steep fulfillment expenses
Unfortunately, Amazon does not have an offsetting balance to declining consumer incomes. Folks with less money are likely to order less frequently from Amazon and/or decrease order sizes. The latter could have the effect of further lowering the already-low operating profit margin for the e-commerce retailer.
Unlike eBay, which allows buyers and sellers to determine shipping and handling, Amazon manages fulfillment for its buyers and sellers. That means if people are spending less per order, fulfillment expenses could deleverage. As you can imagine, it might cost Amazon more to ship you a bottle of shampoo by itself than the value of the shampoo -- depending on the brand, of course. Indeed, fulfillment expenses totaled 30% of revenue for Amazon in its most recent quarter.
Data source: Ycharts
Already, Amazon operates at much lower margins than eBay (see chart), and decreasing consumer income is likely to make it worse. Overall, the fading of fiscal stimulus is likely to hurt both firms, but Amazon could take a bigger hit.

Even so, the pandemic has only really front-loaded growth in the space, as e-commerce expansion has been a long-standing trend.
Internet and direct marketing companies such as Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY), and Etsy (NASDAQ: ETSY) are poised to benefit, whether the pandemic is brought under control or not. Let's take a closer look at these three e-commerce stocks and why they might be worth buying and holding over the next decade.
Image source: Getty Images.
1. Amazon: Enviable growth rates, despite its already large size
The business world's version of the law of large numbers suggests that the larger a company's market cap becomes, the harder it becomes for that company to maintain a high percentage growth rate. Amazon -- which is currently valued at around $1.8 trillion -- can't escape that truth. It just ignores it and continues to deliver impressive growth, year after year.
While most think of Amazon first as an e-commerce juggernaut, retailing remains a low-margin business. Amazon now makes the largest share of its profits in a different area -- cloud computing, which it offers through Amazon Web Services (AWS).
For the first six months of 2021, the company's overall revenue of $221.6 billion represented a 35% increase versus the same period in 2020. Although AWS accounts for just 13% of that top-line revenue, its growth was on par with the e-commerce segment. Profits surged 104% during that period to $15.9 billion, primarily due to lower expenses from non-core businesses.
What's worth noting here is that AWS had an operating margin of 29% over the last 12 months, versus operating margins of 4% in North America and 2% internationally for Amazon's e-commerce operations. Consequently, AWS earned $8.4 billion in operating income in the first six months of the year versus $8.2 billion for the e-commerce business. So AWS's high margins and its (relatively) small size are helping the overall company maintain its strong growth rate.
With economic activity starting to return to something resembling its pre-pandemic normal, Amazon management has offered limited guidance -- understandable, given that it's unclear to what degree an increase in offline retail activity might hurt the company. In part due to those concerns, the stock has been on a bumpy, sideways road for the past year. It's currently up by around 12% over the last 12 months, lagging the S&P 500's nearly 36% gain.
That relative stagnation, though, has helped bring its P/E ratio down to a multi-year low of 60. That gives investors an unusual opportunity to buy this still-growing tech giant at a relatively reasonable valuation.
2. eBay: New leadership brings renewed interest in this stock
At first glance, eBay might seem like a strange stock recommendation. As a company, the online auction pioneer has been eclipsed by lower-cost and easier-to-use e-commerce sites over time. Moreover, former subsidiary PayPal rapidly outpaced its parent following its 2015 spinoff, and now sports a market cap nearly seven times larger than eBay's.
However, new CEO Jamie Iannone, who previously held executive roles at Walmart, may be giving investors a reason to take an interest in the company again. Industry analysts credit Iannone for much of Walmart's recent e-commerce success. At eBay, he has made improvements such as an easier listing process, storefronts for mobile devices, and a managed payments system that brings digital wallet capabilities to the platform.
The top and bottom lines have reflected these changes. In the first half of 2021, revenue surged 28% from year-ago levels to $5.3 billion due in large part to the payments system. This occurred as gross merchandise volume (GMV) fell 7% year over year during Q2 as more consumers returned to offline shopping. Still, as CFO Steve Priest mentioned on the Q2 2021 earnings call, GMV has risen 19% since Q2 2019.
Additionally, income from continuing operations fell during this period as a higher cost of revenue from payments costs and interest expenses negated the revenue improvements. However, thanks to $10.5 billion in income from discontinued operations, net income during the period rose 174% to $11.4 billion.
As the pandemic continues to disrupt economies, the company's immediate future remains uncertain, but management is projecting year-over-year revenue growth between 6% and 8% in Q3. Nonetheless, eBay's stock price has risen by more than 40% over the last 12 months. Also, its price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of below 5 remains well under Pinterest's sales multiple of 15. Given that eBay continued to outperform its pre-pandemic results, it may be one of the better bargains in e-commerce stocks.

3. Etsy: Expanding its niche operation into more countries
Etsy has thrived with a unique approach to e-commerce, serving craftspeople, craft supply sellers, and vintage item dealers, and creating an online community of buyers and sellers. It attracts sellers by allowing them to list items for as little as $0.20 and connects buyers to unique product offerings through its specialized search tool.
While it operates primarily in the U.S., in recent years, it has taken this concept to countries such as the U.K., Germany, and Australia. More recently, it bought Elo7, often referred to as the ""Etsy of Brazil"" for its similar business model.
It may need to make more such moves to continue its growth. In the first six months of 2021, those increases led to revenue of $1.1 billion, 64% higher than in the same period last year. Slower growth in the cost of revenue, lower income taxes, and positive income from outside sources allowed Etsy to earn $242 million during that period, 122% more than in the same time last year.
Admittedly, Etsy, like other e-commerce players, remains cautious in its outlook due to ongoing uncertainty about the course of the pandemic and how changing consumer behaviors will impact the company. Also, the 14% revenue increase management has forecast for Q3 would equate to slowing growth, at least temporarily.
Nonetheless, investors have favored Etsy -- the stock is up by more than 90% over the last 12 months. Despite that increase, a 62 P/E ratio places its valuation on par with Amazon. As more sellers worldwide gravitate to the platform to market their unique creations, Etsy's stock should continue to craft more gains.

2021-09-10 00:00:00+00:00,3 Brilliant Growth Stocks to Buy in September,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-brilliant-growth-stocks-to-buy-in-september-2021-09-10,,,"Here's a simple strategy for making money in the stock market. First, identify trends that should pick up momentum. Second, find the companies that are leaders in those trends. Third, buy and hold the stocks of those companies.
Granted, this approach doesn't always take a linear path to delivering solid returns. Sometimes, stocks go down before they go up. However, following those three simple steps can make you look like an investing genius if you hold on long enough.
I'll make the process even easier by identifying some trends and leaders in those areas. Here are three brilliant growth stocks to buy in September.

MercadoLibre
Mark my words: E-commerce will become even bigger over the next decade. So will digital payments. MercadoLibre (NASDAQ: MELI) stands out as a leader in both areas.
Some call MercadoLibre the ""Amazon of Latin America"" -- and they're not referring to the river. Others have dubbed it the ""eBay of Latin America."" The truth is that MercadoLibre is both similar to and different from both e-commerce giants.
Like Amazon, MercadoLibre operates a big online shopping platform. The company started out, though, with an online auction business that closely paralleled eBay's approach. Today, MercadoLibre also offers logistics services, credit cards, online payment processing, mobile wallets, and more. It's no longer only a leading e-commerce stock; it's also a top fintech stock.
Latin America became the fastest-growing e-commerce market in the world last year. However, e-commerce penetration levels are still well below those of the U.S. and China. Digital payment transaction volume in Latin America is projected to soar by more than 70% by 2025. MercadoLibre should have plenty of room to grow.
MongoDB
Another key trend is companies shifting their data to the cloud. There's one company at the forefront of facilitating this migration -- MongoDB (NASDAQ: MDB).
MongoDB's Atlas is a fully managed cloud database platform. Customers are flocking to Atlas, as evidenced by revenue for the platform jumping 83% year over year in MongoDB's second-quarter results.
There's a straightforward reason behind this phenomenal growth for Atlas. MongoDB CEO Dev Ittycheria summed it up in his company's Q2 conference call: ""Our customers want to innovate faster and are looking for a scalable general-purpose application data platform that will give their developers the freedom to move quickly. MongoDB is increasingly seen as uniquely positioned to fulfill this need.""
The stock has skyrocketed nearly 1,400% over the last five years. Can MongoDB keep the momentum going? I think so. The company should continue to attract new customers. And it should grow as its existing customers expand. Ittycheria said in the Q2 call that he's ""even more optimistic today"" than he's been in the past. My view is that his optimism is warranted.
Teladoc Health
The COVID-19 pandemic poured fuel on the fire for the adoption of telehealth. Teladoc Health (NYSE: TDOC) ranked as one of the biggest beneficiaries. But don't think for a second that telehealth will fade away once the pandemic is over.
There are simply too many positives for telehealth, especially Teladoc's platform. It's cheaper for payers. It's more convenient for patients. Unsurprisingly, more than 40% of Fortune 500 companies use Teladoc.
While Teladoc is the leader in telehealth, it also has expanded into other virtual care services. The company's acquisition of Livongo last year brought a leading chronic disease management platform into its product lineup.
My Motley Fool colleague Jason Hawthorne recently noted that Wall Street doesn't think you can lose with Teladoc. Nearly every analyst has a 12-month price target that's higher than Teladoc's current share price. I agree with Wall Street that Teladoc's shares could rise significantly in the near term. However, I like the stock's long-term growth prospects even more.

2021-09-10 00:00:00+00:00,Chronext aims to raise 250 mln Sfr in IPO,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/chronext-aims-to-raise-250-mln-sfr-in-ipo-2021-09-10-0,,,"By Silke Koltrowitz and Oliver Hirt
ZURICH, Sept 10 (Reuters) - Swiss online marketplace Chronext wants to issue new shares worth around 250 million Swiss francs and also place existing shares from investors in an initial public offering (IPO) at Swiss stock exchange SIX, the company said on Friday.
""The IPO is targeted to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2021, subject to market conditions,"" the company said in a statement.
Chronext, which sells new and second-hand luxury watches online, wants to use half of the proceeds for acquisitions and invest the rest in the existing business, Chief Executive Philipp Man told Reuters in an interview.
The market for second-hand luxury watches, in particular for popular brands such as Rolex, Patek Philippe and Audemars Piguet, is booming also for Chronext's rivals WatchBox, Richemont-owned CFR.S Watchfinder, Ebay EBAY.O and Chrono24.
Reuters reported in May that Chrono24 was also mulling an IPO. It recently secured funding from the Arnault family that controls LVMHLVMH.PA.
WatchBox took a majority stake in independent watch brand De Bethune last week.
Chronext's Man said the company wanted to further consolidate its position in Europe and enter the Asian and the U.S. market. ""These markets are highly fragmented, we see acquisition targets there,"" he said.
Founded in 2013, Chronext generated sales of more than 100 million euros last year. It said it was targeting revenue growth of about 40% for 2021 after increasing sales by 20.3% in the first half and achieving a compound annual growth rate of 47% since 2018.
It is also targeting profitability on EBITDA level in the mid term, Man said.
Kepler Cheuvreux analyst Jon Cox said he estimated the secondary market was worth $20 billion and growing faster than the primary market.
He said he expected the market for second-hand luxury watches to keep growing fast and reach a similar volume online to the market for new watches.
Jefferies and UBS are global coordinators for the IPO, while Bank of America and Deutsche Bank act as bookrunners.

2021-09-09 00:00:00+00:00,Interesting EBAY Put And Call Options For October 29th,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/interesting-ebay-put-and-call-options-for-october-29th-2021-09-09,,,"Investors in eBay Inc. (Symbol: EBAY) saw new options become available today, for the October 29th expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the EBAY options chain for the new October 29th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $73.00 strike price has a current bid of $2.82. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $73.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $70.18 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of EBAY, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $73.50/share today.
Because the $73.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 100%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 3.86% return on the cash commitment, or 28.20% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for eBay Inc., and highlighting in green where the $73.00 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $74.00 strike price has a current bid of $2.81. If an investor was to purchase shares of EBAY stock at the current price level of $73.50/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $74.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 4.50% if the stock gets called away at the October 29th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if EBAY shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for eBay Inc., as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing EBAY's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $74.00 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $74.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 3.82% boost of extra return to the investor, or 27.91% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.
Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $73.50) to be 35%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

2021-09-09 00:00:00+00:00,2 Top Growth Stocks to Buy Right Now and Hold for the Long Term,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/2-top-growth-stocks-to-buy-right-now-and-hold-for-the-long-term-2021-09-09,,,"Some investors are growing concerned about the state of the economy, inflation, and the direction the stock market might go next. Regardless of what happens in the near term, though, successful investing is about buying shares in strong companies and sticking with them for many years.
Two top growth stocks that are poised to deliver market-beating returns over the next decade or more are Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL). Here are the key factors that should fuel their prospects for a long time.
Image source: Getty Images.
Apple
Apple has all the qualities that long-term investors should look for in a stock. It has a loyal base of customers making use of 1.65 billion active Apple devices. It generates loads of cash -- $95 billion in free cash flow over the last four quarters alone. Above all, it has tremendous brand power combined with a very sticky ecosystem of services.
Smartphone rival Samsung just launched its latest round of foldable phones -- the Galaxy Z Fold 3 and Galaxy Z Flip 3 -- and they've received good reviews. Apple still hasn't unveiled a competing offering, but it's always late to the party when it comes to adopting the latest technologies. Yet its customer satisfaction rates remain high, driving a record $347 billion in total spending on products and services over the last year.
What keeps Apple users from jumping ship to competitors' products is the software experience. Its ever-growing suite of services, accessories, and features forms a wide competitive moat. Services revenue increased 28% year over year through the first three quarters of fiscal 2021. Sales of wearables and accessories, including the Apple Watch, grew 30%. The array of apps and features like Handoff, which allows a user to switch seamlessly from an app on an iOS device to a Mac, makes Apple's devices work better together, which gives customers an extra incentive to just stick with the company for all of their tech needs.
It's no surprise that Apple continues to report strong growth for non-iPhone products. Mac sales surged 16% year over year in the most recent quarter. Moreover, the new M1-based Macs, featuring Apple's new internally developed processor, position the company to squeeze extra profit out of its computer business since the M1 chip is estimated to cost Apple less than the Intel chips it previously used.
As for iPhones, consumers are getting more interested in upgrading to 5G devices, which is expected to make the launch of the iPhone 13 a big one. The prospect of a strong upgrade cycle to 5G devices, combined with the continued growth of its higher-margin services business, makes Apple a solid investment.

PayPal
PayPal has delivered many years of consistent growth, previously as part of eBay and now as an independent company, but the pandemic has accelerated the trend away from cash and toward digital payments. A Mastercard survey found that 71% of consumers expect to use cash for transactions less often in the future, which plays right into the hands of PayPal.
The digital payments provider's customer engagement has steadily climbed in recent years and should continue to do so. Since the end of 2017, transactions per account have climbed from 33.6 on a trailing-12-month basis to 43.5 as of the second quarter of 2021. This means the average customer still uses their PayPal account less than once per week, but there are good reasons to expect this metric to continue rising.
Recent introductions of a cryptocurrency trading feature and a buy-now, pay-later option, plus the potential for adding the ability to trade stocks from within the app, could significantly grow engagement across PayPal's 403 million active accounts.
This growing array of services and features has a direct correlation with PayPal's rising revenue. For example, it has seen a 19% increase in total payment volume from customers who use its QR codes to check out at stores.
The company has experienced phenomenal growth, and the stock delivered a massive return of 640% over the last five years. Its revenue also more than doubled, and that is with customers still using their accounts less than once per week on average. PayPal could grow enormously from here if engagement strengthens, which is management's goal. For these reasons, this growth stock should remain a rewarding investment for years to come.

As the focus on consumer-based businesses continues to grow, retail stocks could likely continue to gain in thestock market today Understandably, consumer spending power could be on the higher end of the spectrum now, thanks to pent-up demand as the economy reopens. Additionally, as more consumers get fully vaccinated, there would be more viable means of spending their funds. Given all of this, it would make sense that investors are turning their radars towards retail stocks.
Earlier this week, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) hit an all-time high after it announced an event on September 14 which is widely expected to see the reveal of the new iPhone. There is a strong consumer spending trend across the retail and entertainment industries. Reasonably, this would be the case as in-person entertainment bounces back with movement restrictions being gradually lifted. It seems like the reopening trade continues to gain momentum. Having read this, you might be interested to add some retail stocks to your portfolio as well. In that case, here are five names to watch in the stock market this week.
Best Retail Stocks To Buy [Or Sell] Right Now
GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME)
Procter & Gamble Co. (NYSE: PG)
Coca-Cola Co. (NYSE: KO)
Scotts Miracle-Gro Co. (NYSE: SMG)
eBay Inc. (NASDAQ: EBAY)
GameStop 
After trading sideways for the past couple of months, GameStop stock is back in the spotlight. The video game retailer is set to announce its earnings after the stock market closes today. Unless you have been living under a rock, chances are you have heard of this video game retailer taking the stock market by storm earlier this year. For starters, the company is a consumer electronics and gaming company that offers entertainment products in more than 4,000 stores and comprehensive e-commerce properties across 10 countries.
In many ways, GameStop has become a symbol of resistance against Wall Street. There’s no question that there’s a clear gap between its fundamentals and the valuation of GME stock. But hey, the trend is your friend, and it may potentially be risky to bet against GME stock right now. Every time you think that GME stock is about to crash, it bounces back higher.
The company has been trying to reinvent its business. For one, focusing on high-margin product categories such as collectibles and PC gaming accessories has helped the company grow as well. What’s more, Ryan Cohen spearheading its e-commerce initiatives is another reason why retail investors have continued to be bullish on GME stock. Now, with the company reporting this evening, many are expecting GME stock to move sharply one way or the other after the fiscal report.

Procter & Gamble
Procter & Gamble is a multinational consumer goods corporation. The company specializes in a wide range of personal health/consumer health and hygiene products. Its consumer goods are sold in over 180 countries and territories. Apart from being a top choice among consumer staples stocks, PG stock also offers one of the longest dividend growth track records. Its stability in revenue and dividend yield in the past six decades make it one of the best consumer staples stocks to buy with or without the pandemic.
The recovery in demand for beauty and cosmetics and the rise in home care products seem to be driving sales up. We can see this from the company’s recent quarter results where revenue grew 7% to $76.1 billion year-over-year. The company seems to be able to control costs with operating margins increasing to 23.7% from 22.1% last year. Considering all these, will you add PG stock to your watchlist right now?

Coca-Cola 
Following that, let’s take a look at Coca-Cola. Apart from its famous non-alcoholic sparkling soft drinks, it also markets and licenses energy drinks, juice, coffee and tea, and many more. Its branded beverage products are available in more than 200 countries. Today, millions of consumers turn to the company’s Coca-Cola, Sprite, and Fanta brands among others for their beverage needs. With KO stock trading just below its pre-pandemic levels, could it have more room to grow moving forward?
Some believe that the gradual lifting of lockdowns and successful vaccination deployment are driving the comeback of KO stock. The stock has the potential to rise further with sporting events, entertainment sites, and others likely to ramp up with easing restrictions. Not to mention, the company has typically been good at managing costs. With all that in mind, would you say that KO stock is one of the best stocks to invest in right now?

Scotts Miracle-Gro Company
Next up, we have Scotts Miracle-Gro. The company has been in business since 1868. Its consumer lawn and garden goods are household brands across the U.S. But the more interesting story here is that the company’s premium gardening products and solutions could see increased demand, especially if the marijuana regulations ease up. The company’s growth may be slowing, but that shouldn’t come as a surprise. After all, many were stuck at home due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Scotts Miracle-Gro’s Hawthorne segment seems to be the company’s main growth driver as of late. In detail, the company’s recent quarter sales grew 8% driven by Hawthorne’s growth of 48% to $421.9 million which accounted for 26% of the company’s total revenue. It currently ranks as a top supplier to cannabis growers. Considering all these, will you be watching SMG stock?

eBay Inc
Lastly, we have one of the industry leaders of e-commerce, eBay. The company’s technology allows sellers worldwide to offer their inventory for sale virtually anytime and anywhere. Unlike Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN), eBay does not have fulfillment centers. In brief, you could say that eBay is a middleman that collects a small commission on each transaction. And this model is proving to be lucrative, with operating margins above 20% every year for the past decade.
Looking at the strong results from its recent quarters, there are a few categories including authenticated sneakers, trading cards, and luxury watches where CEO Jamie Iannone sees “untapped potential” for further growth. If anything, the goal here seems to be to offer more in-demand items that appeal to younger people. With eBay continuing to succeed at bringing in younger shoppers, will you be adding EBAY stock to your portfolio?

ContextLogic (NASDAQ:WISH) stock bulls are having their patience tested. InvestorPlace analysts have a distinctly bullish outlook on the company because it’s an e-commerce play targeting the value-conscious consumer. What’s not to love?
Source: sdx15 / Shutterstock.com
During a bullish market, one would expect companies like WISH to do well. Sadly, the bears are firmly in control of this chart.
For the value investor, this is great, though.
Why? Well, total revenues more than doubled in the last four years. And the momentum will not cease any time soon. The reason is simple. ContextLogic is focusing on an underserved niche. Millennials have surpassed baby boomers as the nation’s largest living adult generation and represent the biggest slice of the labor force.
As my colleague Josh Enomoto pointed out, this generation is not terribly brand-conscious, preferring functionality over everything else.
Companies like ContextLogic have a lot to gain in this environment. The markets, in my opinion, are overreacting in response to the quarterly results. If anything, the recent dip gives you an incentive to purchase more of WISH stock. Markets reward consistent performance and a tech-heavy operating model. So, it’s only a matter of time before all of these things combine to push ContextLogic upward.

In the meantime, you can go ahead and accumulate shares at more affordable rates.
Quarterly Results Dampen Investor Sentiment
WISH stock has been in free fall since the last earnings report dropped. The company went public at the end of last year at $24 a share. As I write this, shares are changing hands for under $8.
Now part of the reason is understandable. The e-commerce platform operator’s revenue of $656 million was below the $723 million expected by analysts and represents a 6% year-over-year drop. Even management didn’t anticipate such a hit, having guided for 3% growth.
But you have to put the numbers in context. Last year was a unique one because of the pandemic and increased stay-at-home shopping.
If you take a look at other areas, things are looking up. Logistics revenue jumped 126%, clearly showing merchants are warming up to ContextLogic. Yes, marketplace revenue fell 29% year-over-year, but that was expected. Even Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) could only muster year-over-year revenue growth of just 27% and 14%, respectively, in the second quarter.
People have been cooped up in their homes for quite some time, and a return to in-person shopping is causing a change of pace. And that is also affecting the markets.
Keep Your Eye on the Ball
Another major reason the e-commerce platform did not do well in the second quarter is decreased marketing spending. Although the company has done well to increase brand awareness, it cannot afford to take its foot off the gas.
However, for now, it looks like management has other ideas.
ContextLogic said it expects its marketplace revenue to decline further in the second half of 2021 due to a reduction in digital advertising expenditures. A combination of decreasing advertising expenses and the lifting of stay-at-home orders is not the ideal recipe for sustained revenue growth.
In the earnings call, Wish’s Founder and CEO, Peter Szulczewski, had this to say:
From a macro perspective, affecting rates increased and stay-at-home orders began to ease over the past few months. Daily user activity and active buyers on our platform declined more than we anticipated. This was particularly true in the U.S., France, and Italy, three of our largest markets.
In fact, we saw a 13% reduction in app installs and a 15% reduction in average time spent on our platform globally from the second quarter of 2020.
We are also in the middle of the company transforming its business model. WISH’s newly adopted user retention strategy, as opposed to acquisition, needs to run its course. WISH wants to accomplish this business transformation through increasing product quality and variety across merchants, taking care of app latency and bugs, and “leaning into social commerce and entertaining features.” However, it will take a few quarters for this strategy to take root.
A combination of these factors is weighing down investor sentiment in the short run.
All the Right Elements Are in Place for WISH Stock
Has ContextLogic stumbled a bit coming out of earnings season? Yes, absolutely. However, many of the issues highlighted deal with short-term tactical problems, which WISH can address in due course. The broader reasons why ContextLogic remains a great stock are still relevant.
Millennials and workforce-entering Gen Z looking for affordable products are a massive demographic. Secondly, WISH has $1.6 billion of cash and marketable securities by the end of the first quarter; a lot of capital to scale operations and become cash-flow positive.
The fact that investors got spooked due to the latest earnings should not surprise. In the last few months, recovery stocks are getting most of the attention from Wall Street. While those stocks will continue to do well, undervalued plays like WISH stock also deserve a place in your portfolio.

This video was recorded on Aug. 27, 2021.
Dylan Lewis: It's Friday, Aug. 27th, and we're bringing you a session from our recent member event FoolFest. I'm your usual Friday host, but I will not be sticking around long. Today we're going to be airing a session from our July member event, Crypto + A Foolish Portfolio. Crypto investor and Fool Germany analyst Bernd Schmid joined host Kate Herman to talk though his outlook on crypto, the opportunity, most interesting applications and how to tell pretenders from contenders as investment opportunities. It's a great conversation for beginner and intermediate crypto investors alike, and a nice way for us to touch on a space we don't discuss much in our usual lineup of shows. Hope you enjoy!
Kate Herman: I'm tickled to be joined today by Bernd Schmid. He heads up our Stock Advisor Germany service. Bernd, this is going to be an exciting half hour. I'm really glad to be here with you. In Bernd's daily work, he's responsible for finding the best companies to invest in in the German-speaking region but he also has been diving deeply into the crypto space for the past two years. You're here with an expert in the field today and we're going to put all of that work and research to the test. You ready Bernd?
Bernd Schmid: I'm ready, Kate. Thanks so much for the introduction. Happy to be here.
Herman: Excellent. Well, let's get started. First up, we know that fools who are watching today have opted into this session. There is either experience in the crypto investing space or perhaps we're joined by a few members who are just getting started and wanting to learn a little more. I think it would be wise to make sure we're all on the same page when we talk Foolishly about investing in cryptocurrency, we're talking about what? The digital currency that you can use to buy things. There's an online ledger, we've got cryptography, blockchain technology. Bernd, you've already lost me. Can you talk about blockchain technology and get us started on the basics of crypto before we really launch into a deeper dive?
Schmid: Yeah, blockchain, I think you understand best if you just think about it as a database that is distributed in the web on different kinds of computers. It's called blockchain because the database consists of individual blocks which consist of the data that you want to have sort and the blocks are being chained together by cryptography. That's where the term crypto comes from.
Herman: Why are people so excited about blockchain technology? I think we've all been hearing and learning about crypto now for several years and it still sometimes feels like it's just taking off and also sometimes feels like it's been here forever. Why is there still such excitement around this technology?
Schmid: I think one reason, there's a lot of people who got rich quick, this attracts [laughs] everybody else. You buy Bitcoin in 2013 and you're richer four years later or do the same thing in 2017. You don't know it might happen again. But I think the underlying here it's not just superficial get-rich-quick scheme or something like this but the technology itself and the applications that it enables is very exciting. Sorry, I forgot who, but I think it was a venture capitalist, he talks about it like it's a second big layer on the internet technology. The first one was the web, in the mid-'90s that enabled all of us to come online, to browse the web, to put up information there, to share information and everything that comes on top and now blockchain technologies is the next layer on top of it. It not enables the sharing of information but the sharing of value or the transaction of value. Like you and I Kate, I can send you a Bitcoin and in an instant, you'll have this and it will be in your hand and you will control it. That's something that wasn't able to be done before. In the mid-'90s, you and I we were not able to invest into the HTTP protocol or in JavaScript or something like this. We could buy Amazon in 1997 but that even this was quite limited. Today with the blockchain, you actually can invest into these protocols, you can invest in stuff that has been created. Like we as investors, we can be there at the very, very early stage.
Herman: Fools are very familiar with investing in stocks. We have a long-term buy and hold philosophy that's very well-known to people. We recommend Fools have at least 25 investments in their portfolio, crypto investments can count, yes? Help me understand what's the most simple, the easiest to understand thesis for owning crypto as part of an overall investment portfolio. Where does crypto fit in?
Schmid: I think It really depends on the individual. If you dig deep at something, you try to understand something, you can think about it differently, but from a prospect of an investor, I think most of our members who don't pick into ourselves, they probably are in our services because when you look at companies and recommend them, I will probably look at cryptos as very high-growth stocks; very high risk, but very high potential reward. I keep saying, I'm not even sure if it's a real target, but there might be some truth in it, but in crypto, the crypto market is like the stock market, except everything happens 10 times faster and 10 times more extreme. Volatility is huge and also the historical Bitcoin cycle, if you can call it like this, you have like a four-year cycle where Bitcoin goes up 50x and then falls by 80-90 percent. It's happened already. Bitcoin was brought into the world in 2008, I think it was at January 2009. One of these two years, four years later, you had one high cycle in 2013 then 2017. Maybe many people remember this and now in 2021 or end of last year it started again.
Herman: We hear a lot about Bitcoin. I think that is certainly the most common term that you hear associated with this. How many different kinds of cryptocurrency are out there?
Schmid: I love this question Kate [laughs]. I have a good answer to that but that's not coming from me. I stole it from a guy called Jeff Dorman. Many people think about this space so differently so it just puts a frame into it. I'll give you my frame. Jeff Dorman thinks about four big buckets into which you can put these different cryptos, let's call it into. The first one he calls [UNCLEAR] crypto currencies. What is a currency? A currency is a medium of exchange change. You and I, we can transact and I give you some currency for it and you serve me a piece of bread or something.
Herman: Right, gummy worm.
Schmid: I love this, horrible. [laughs] Candidates really invested in this company. [laughs] May be a token soon. Anyway, cryptocurrencies, it's like Bitcoin is a typical example for this. You can also argue about how much of a medium of exchange it is, but you can not do much more with Bitcoin than exchange the value and then hold this value yourself or what to do with the currency. This is a cryptocurrency. Then the second of these four buckets would be platforms. These are, Ethereum is the most well-known and it's the second-biggest crypto out there. A platform is something where you use the blockchain technology to implement a decentralized applications, for example. They are applications that run on this blockchain, essentially. Jeff Dorman calls these platforms. You can invest in these platforms. You can invest into Ether, for example, or into EOS or in the other platform and many more. The third pocket, he calls asset-backed tokens. An asset-backed token is also a crypto, a token that you hold yourself. Bitcoin is a token, Ether is a token, everything are tokens. Asset-backed means there's a real asset value behind it. For example, you could tokenize real estate and it's already happening. For example, I think the Aspen resort that is somewhere in the U.S. I don't even know exactly this has been tokenized and these tokens can be traded. This token has a real asset value behind it and this is an asset-backed token and the fourth big pocket, the last one, would be pass-through tokens. This is a token that passes some value through to you. It's very individual. I think a good example is one of the biggest crypto exchanges, I think out there, maybe the biggest one would be Binance. It's an often in the news lately, but they have something called a Binance token. If you buy it and you trade on the exchange and depending on the number of tokens you hold, you get a discount on the trading fees or you're allowed to have bigger trades or something like this. This will be a typical pass-through token. You buy it and it has a individual value to you. You trade a lot, you would like to own some Binance tokens just to make these trades easier. Just to summarize, these are the four big packets, the cryptocurrencies, the platforms, the asset-backed tokens, and the pass-through tokens.
Herman: In prepping for our conversation today, I was startled to find out that the total value of all cryptocurrencies on the market just last week was over $1 trillion U.S., which certainly gets a Fool's attention in terms of a potential investment there definitely seems so much opportunity there. Also as more of a blue-chip investor myself, I can't stop but wonder, where's the stability in cryptocurrency? I know what a Disney or a Starbucks or an Apple is doing. I see their quarterly reports, I follow their movements, I can read in the news how they're doing. What's the underpinning of cryptocurrency? Where is the stability coming from or not?
Schmid: Yeah, that's probably not much stability.
Herman: I think you are right [laughs].
Schmid: It's a very new technology and there's so much innovation happening. It's not my full-time job, I just spend one or two days a week, but I really try to understand this better, there's every day there is something new that I learn or something has changed. It's just a disruption, how is it called? This disruptive innovation that is happening. If you look at individual projects, that's how I would look at it, I don't invest in the space like in ETF and I won't do on everything, but I think there's some really exciting projects out there. If you just look at Bitcoin where's the stability, if you look at the number of users or the number of addresses. Addresses, where you store your Bitcoin and how you can access your Bitcoin. If you look at the number of individual addresses are out there, it's climbing relatively steadily. It is fluctuating, but not as crazily wild as the price is fluctuating. I think the stability of this whole space comes from actually the increasing and the incremental number of users that is being drawn in by all these projects, many of them. I think 10 years from now, 80-90 percent, maybe even more, won't be there anymore, but they will be 10 percent and there will be others, I don't know how many that will have created real value like now they will create real value. But overall the whole space it brings in more and more users. Actually, I don't have the exact number, but I think right now it's about 150 million users in the whole crypto space. If you looked at the trajectory how it has developed in the past.
Herman: Yes, the trajectory [laughs].
Schmid: Trajectory and you lay it over. The [UNCLEAR] chart, you lay it over the internet users that you had. You actually see that with these 150 million there about, where the internet was in the mid-'90s, we're coming back to the mid-'90s type of theme where we are right now. The development has been relatively comparable between the web technology, let's say, internet users and blockchain users. If you just continue this trajectory forward, you can expect about a billion internet users in the next 4-5 years, I think at the latest. I think this is what I would see the space that's here to stay. That's why even though internally there's a lot of volatility and there's a lot of disruption going on coins coming and going, it will grow and it is here to stay.
Herman: Fascinating. Let's get into it for the Fools who are watching this breakout session and either have already taken the plunge and are looking for a new opportunity, or are ready to dive into the space. How do we strip out the noise and figure out which investments here are legitimate and which ones might be a little more fly by night that we would want to avoid? How do you identify a legit crypto investment?
Schmid: There's two things I think that I would look at right now, are two most important things to see if at least there might be something to it. One is the user base, is it growing? Does it gain traction in terms of how many people are really using this thing? The second one is there something, does it solve the problem that adds value to somebody? For example, bring a negative example, Dogecoin. In Dogecoin you have the first condition which is fulfilled, you have increase in users there are a lot of people who are interested in this thing. But I personally, and I could be totally wrong and maybe something is coming but I personally don't see any specific problem that Dogecoin is solving that something else doesn't solve. I for example would not think that Dogecoin is something of value, it might change. Elon Musk, he probably noticed he's been pumping Dogecoins for whatever reason. I don't know what's going on with this guy's mind for doing that. But for example, he could come up with a use case, maybe he'll make Dogecoin the currency of Tesla users. You can buy Tesla, it means you can buy upgrades to Tesla with Dogecoins and you might get discount. Suddenly, there's a use price case, for Dogecoin and this could all change. But anyway, these two things, number of users is it growing? Is there a network effect? Second is there a real problem that is being solved, does it add value for users?
Herman: I think that's really helpful because just as the stock market that people might be a little more familiar with, tends to ride certain waves, so, too, does cryptocurrency. It was almost double its current value just two or three months ago in April. Now it's taken a bit of a dive, but it's still sitting well above a billion dollars. Knowing where to start in that space and what seems a little bit more of a smart choice, I'm not going to say a sure bet because there's no such thing in investing [laughs] but how we can take that plunge. If I were to put money into crypto, how much should it be? Let's assume I'm a good compliant Fool and I have 25-plus investments across my portfolio, we will start with that premise. How much weight should this have in my portfolio?
Schmid: I think this is individual. It really depends on you. For example, somebody in their retirement just living off their portfolios, I would recommend a completely different thing than somebody who's just starting their career, has a little bit of money to invest, and is expecting his income to be much higher than his portfolio probably. How I would think about it in general is and if I start with this, and I don't know much about it, I just want to learn. Think about it as one growth stock that you want to put into your portfolio, excited about whatever Netflix or the latest Rule Breakers recommendation which I don't know which it is, but you know you want to invest in it. Just build one position, it's one stock. Get a feel for it. Start with one or two cryptocurrencies that you're familiar with and understand a little bit. Then I think you can expand from it, I think if you really understand it well you get really good advice, what's important yes, it's long-term thinking always. But I think you could potentially replace also if you always say you want to have 25 positions in your portfolio and you are an investor who just like this number because you can have an overview and you don't want that more, you might replace other growth stocks with these cryptos. I don't know where the limit is, I would never put 100 percent of my portfolio to, even if it's 50 different cryptos because they're all going up and down, with Bitcoin right now still and for whatever reason you need some money and you need to liquidate that at 90 percent drop, it hurts a lot. I don't know where the limit is. From me personally, I have quite a lot but let's say of my 30 positions that I have probably 15 crypto positions, but this is also because I think I understand these things. I'm relatively well and I would not recommend though for a beginner to go that far.
Herman: In that zone, what concerns do you have about this space in the market, the crypto space? What are you watching? What are you worried about, if anything?
Schmid: In terms of the market itself? Actually, I'm not that worried. There's a lot of things going on with China trying to ban Bitcoin or at least which we've heard but, they advise some miners to stop operating, they don't want this or also the taxation discussion. I think Joe Biden brought up a month or two ago. Then there was a third thing it all happened at the same time in selling market treasures and regulations is another topic that is not so here like these things called non-fungible tokens, which might be asset-backed or backed by something by art, for example. Are these securities or not? What restrictions should there be? What disclosures should there be? There is a lot of open. There's a lot of uncertainty in the sense of how much regulation, whether it'd be how will China react? How will other countries react? It doesn't really concern me in the market though because I'm quite convinced that the use cases there, the applications are there and they will prevail let's say. However, for individual projects and also individual investors, it's just a lot of uncertainty. Like what do you do with this China information? What do you do with this taxation? Actually one thing that disturbs me a lot is this tribalism in this space. I've never believed it but the most extreme is the so-called Bitcoin maximalists. I'm not sure if they themselves call them like this. But these are the guys who say, Bitcoin is the only real thing. All other crypto is **** coins, sorry for that [laughs]. They're very open and they say everything is crap. Only Bitcoin solves everything. There's really smart people with actually quite convincing arguments who believe that. Then you have other trying to believe that one thing and then we have the Ethereum crowd. I think you should approach this whole thing with an open mindedness and be open. Maybe Bitcoin is the only thing, maybe it will really turn out to be that way. But right now, I for example, I don't see this as the most likely scenario. To bring you back, what concerns me is that somebody who's just starting into this, he might get distracted very early on by, why is this guy saying the opposite? It is really tough to navigate as a user or as an investor in this market.
Herman: It makes perfect sense. I think it would explain why some people are very excited to dive in if they tend to be more rule breaker-minded investors and they are excited to be first in this space, and it also helps explain why some other folks aren't willing just yet to even consider it as part of their portfolio. This is very helpful in terms of seeing the bigger picture. How big could this bigger picture get? How big is crypto going to get in the marketplace, do you think?
Schmid: Big. [laughs] it really depends also how you define it. But if you look at it, now we have 1 trillion. The space is about 1 trillion, I think the number that you mentioned. It was 2 trillion two, three months ago.
Herman: Yeah.
Schmid: How big is this? I'm not sure about Amazon market cap right now, but it's two or three times that size. I think it's 2 or 3 trillion. I don't even know the exact number. But this is just compared to one stock. Then if you look into the space, I won't be able to communicate what is happening in the space even a short time, because I probably understand only 50 or probably 10 percent of it. But for example, with these tokens, let's just start with one specific use case just to bring to people who are probably not that deep into this, what you can do with it or what might happen is tokenization of real asset-backed tokens. Like sport athletes, somebody in the young age they might tokenize essentially their career. They can say, these tokens, they represent 10 percent of whatever salary I'm going to earn for my professional football club contract, or something like this, or basketball club contracts. These things, in my opinion, I think they're inevitable to happen. You tokenize that. If you bring all this together, I think the 10X is very likely to come. 10X also, it sounds crazy. But if you just think about gold, the gold has a large capitalization. I don't even know all the gold that has been dug out of the ground in the couple of last 5,000 years. It has a value of, I don't know, 12 trillion or something like this. This is already 10 times the size of the whole crypto space. Many people are now also thinking about Bitcoin as digital gold alternative, let's say it like this. I think Bitcoin can at least match the valuation of gold at some point. Or let's say like this, it won't make sense for me, it wouldn't be completely irrational to think that, in all this you have already a 10X, and then you add all this tokenization, you have asset-backed tokens and then these asset-backed tokens, they're going to trade on exchanges which operate on the block chain. I think 100 trillion, it sounds insane. It's completely crazy. I'm not sure how likely this scenario is starting to happen, but the space really will cover all the use cases that people are thinking now. There might be other technologies also coming. But I'm expecting the 10X, or in the long term, a 100X as a possible scenario.
Herman: That is extraordinary to think about. For those watching who like to deal in real numbers, today's current market cap for Amazon is 1.9 trillion. As of 2017, the value of all the gold in the world would have exceeded $7.5 trillion. Those are the numbers we're dealing with today. You heard it here first, Bernd is projecting that Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies could be bigger than all of it [laughs]. Is there a scenario where a company like an Amazon or Starbucks, do they reach a point where they dabble somehow in the digital currencies market?
Schmid: If I'm not mistaken, it was an Amazon or MercadoLibre, one of the two, they were I think in Brazil or Argentina, somewhere in South America on what was a small country. Peru, maybe they were experimenting. So far, just three countries. South America, one country that were experimenting, I think with the token as a form of payment if I'm not completely mistaken. But quite sure they're trying these things out. It also depends on the use case. There's a guy called [UNCLEAR] if I'm not mistaken. He is very much into this, it's called DAOs, decentralized autonomous organizations. He's talking to people who are protecting actually his ideas also. That for example, at Disney, they might bring a token to the markets where they say, whoever wants this token or wants a certain number of tokens, they might have access to certain gimmicks, like movies that they can see, assuming they might even be able to influence the next movie that Pixar's bringing, or something like this. I think companies can use this. But why was I hesitant in the beginning with my answers? What I think blockchain can do is actually disrupting a lot of these companies also. Because what blockchain and the technology can do is they will remove the middleman of a lot of applications, so whenever you have somebody sitting in the middle and coordinating transactions. I think potentially, just in a world broad sense, this could be replaced by a blockchain. On eBay, for example, you don't need an eBay. You could have a protocol that is completely independent, sitting somewhere on one of these platforms, and all these things are managed, transactions are happening. I think as much as they will probably try these things out, from an investment perspective, from an outside perspective, I would also look at the disruption potential of these companies.
Herman: Yeah.
Schmid: If I can have one more example, I didn't bring up the best examples. One of the tokens I'm most excited in and full disclosure, I think it's my second-biggest position in this space. It's a token called Theta. I also have to disclose that I don't understand the full details of it completely. It's just because it has grown so fast. It's essentially what they do. They make, in my terms, a decentralized YouTube. I don't know how much you have been affected by the censoring that is going on on YouTube. But I think that's a big use case. This Theta token, essentially, it could even be bigger than YouTube. What they want to do is the whole so-called content delivery network to be replaced by essentially the data centers where, for example, the movies are stored and then streamed to the people. They could be replaced by decentralized network of you and I. You and I on our laptop we run so-called ""nodes"" of this Theta network. We get compensated with the currency in this Theta network, for operating these nodes, providing our bandwidth of internet or our computer resources. This could eventually replace Google or YouTube data centers.
Herman: That's incredible. Am I reading right that the price of a token for Theta right now is about $4.95 U.S. For about five bucks you could get a Theta token?
Schmid: That hurts really [laughs]. I bought then when it was a couple of cents. It was already $13 two months ago. It could be that's it's there.
Herman: Something has certainly happened in the crypto market in these past two to three months that has caused things to drop by about half. But what we would say to Fools if it was the stocks that we recommend when they go on sale, that's a good time to really plug in and figure out what a solid investment in that space might be. My final question to you Bernd is, what are you most excited about in the crypto space as we move forward from here? If there are Fools watching who are on the fence, if there are Fools who are excited as well and just looking for someone who is excited as they are. What is it? What is sparking your interest here for the long haul?
Schmid: I think the technology is here to stay, and I think a lot of these protocols and applications that have been developed today have really good use cases and are really useful, and we today can invest into them. I think this is really good. What I'm excited about is that there are already people out there who will bring light to it, who would try to remove the noise from the signal, like we want the signal and there's so much noise out there. I think this is going to happen, for us as investors at least. But right now what's not really good in the space is, what do you call it? The user experience. It's really tough to use these protocols. Even to run a Theta node, is one of the simple examples you can download it and do it. I like the EOS network, but you have to have these wallets. Somebody who is not really grown up with this I think it's just tough and this still keeps a lot of people out. I think this will change though in the next two to three, four years. I believe probably 90 percent of the people in the space they think about how to improve the EOS experience, how to make it that people actually don't feel that they interact with a new technology, but then they're used to this. I think once this happens, there could be another tipping point where really, like I mentioned before, we have about 150 million crypto users. These are the early adopters who really like, and they don't mind all this headache going into this. But I think in the next two, three, four years, there will be this point where it becomes so much easier to use that even somebody who says, too much for me, that sounds easy. Let's try it out. I think this can get very exciting.

2021-09-03 00:00:00+00:00,3 Top E-Commerce Stocks to Buy Right Now,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-top-e-commerce-stocks-to-buy-right-now-2021-09-03,,,"Online retail had a surprisingly difficult month in August as consumers got out of the house and went shopping in local stores instead. As a result, e-commerce stocks posted strong second-quarter results, but their guidance for the next reporting period was muted.
Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), for example, enjoyed revenue growth of 27% in the period compared to a year ago, but that was down from about 44% in the first quarter, and it forecast third-quarter growth would be around 13% at the midpoint of management's guidance range.
If mighty Amazon is seeing its growth slow, what hope do other internet retailers have?
Actually, e-commerce growth estimates remain robust for the current year and beyond, and the three internet retailers below should capitalize handsomely on the opportunity.

Chewy
Last year's lockdowns caused many consumers to acquire new pets, with veterinarians reporting a 50% increase in new pet visits between March and August last year, according to the American Veterinary Medical Association. The American Pet Products Association says consumers bought $103.6 billion worth of food, goods, and services for their pets in 2020, a 6.7% increase, with 47% of pet owners spending more online last year than they had previously.
That bodes well for online pet supplies retailer Chewy (NYSE: CHWY), which sold more than $7 billion worth of goods last year, up 47% from 2019 and more than double 2018's total.
With 20 million active customers, almost 6 million gained last year alone, Chewy will undoubtedly keep most of those even as the ability to shop in a physical store returns. It notes online penetration rates in food and supplies have grown from 7% in 2015 to 30% in 2020 and are expected to reach 53% by 2025.
Chewy's stock has bounced off the lows it hit earlier this year but remains 26% below the highs it hit in February. With a long runway of opportunity, Chewy is just waiting to be unleashed.

Etsy
Etsy (NASDAQ: ETSY) has also battled higher from its lows as it struggles against enormous pandemic-era gains. The COVID-19 outbreak had consumers racing to their keyboards to search for face mask availability. This online platform for handmade goods, vintage items, and craft supplies was the go-to destination. Reprising that starring role won't be easy, but Etsy is trying to make it look like it will be.
The online marketplace added almost 12 million new and reactivated buyers last quarter. The year-over-year growth rate was lower than in 2020, but the 8 million new buyers it added in the period was double the number it added in 2019.
Arguably more important was the number of so-called habitual buyers, or those consumers with six or more purchase days on the site, surged 115% in the quarter, also nearly double the pre-pandemic rate. Consumers who found Etsy are now using the site more often.
Wall Street is looking for Etsy to expand earnings at a compound rate of 53% annually for the next five years, suggesting the internet retailer's stock still has enormous growth potential.

JD.com
After China's latest crackdown on tech companies, investors were rightly nervous about e-commerce giant JD.com (NASDAQ: JD), particularly after the intense scrutiny Alibaba Group Holding underwent.
Yet JD.com has a different business model than its rival, actually more like eBay than Amazon, because it's a platform for third-party sellers rather than selling stuff itself. So while Beijing could go after it as regulators have with other tech stocks, JD.com believes the areas the government is targeting, such as user privacy, don't apply to the company. JD.com already has stringent protocols in place, after all. It could also benefit from the price controls regulators are contemplating, as this regulatory framework may protect JD.com's prices from being undercut by the competition.
After it reported robust second-quarter results, the market seems to have had a change of heart and is running JD.com's stock higher. Shares are up 10% over the past month and 30% above the lows they registered just days ago.
That's still OK for investors as Wall Street sees 30% or more potential upside in its shares. It was admittedly trading higher in the winter, but even analysts got cold feet and lowered their price targets on the stock after the crackdown. It's difficult to recommend Chinese stocks at the moment, but as JD.com continues to exhibit strength, we may very well see them hike their outlooks once more. This internet retailer could easily pick up where it left off.

2021-09-03 00:00:00+00:00,Why Etsy Stock Jumped 18% in August,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-etsy-stock-jumped-18-in-august-2021-09-03,,,"What happened
Etsy (NASDAQ: ETSY) shares trounced a rising market last month. The niche e-commerce company's stock rose 18% in August as the S&P 500 gained 1.2%, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence.
The company's surge can be tied right to the encouraging earnings update that management issued early in the month.
Image source: Getty Images.
So what
The stock initially fell following that report, as investors' first reaction was to worry about slowing growth. Etsy's sales gains decelerated to 23% in Q2, compared to revenue growth of more than 100% year over year in previous quarters. Wall Street was also underwhelmed with management's third-quarter outlook, which predicts another slowdown to growth of about 13%.
However, that forecast still translates to a much stronger business than Etsy had immediately preceding the pandemic. Like bigger peers such as eBay, the company also has a prime opportunity to boost its margins as it adds value to the platform. Its take rate is above 17% of sales, compared to about 11% for eBay.
Now what
The main factors that will influence Etsy's long-term returns are how well it can attract buyers and sellers to its platform, and keep them using it. It is having no trouble in either metric so far in 2021. It gained buyers last quarter, for example, at double the rate from the same period in 2019.
Stats like that imply that Etsy is nowhere close to exhausting the reach of its marketplace. That means investors may see many more strong earnings reports to come.

Other e-commerce sites appear to have eclipsed the performance of eBay's once-popular online auction site, while Shopify seems to have transcended the competition as its stock levels off near recent highs.
However, eBay has returned to double-digit growth amid new leadership and a different approach. The internet and direct marketing retail stock has surged to all-time highs. Given this change, some might wonder whether eBay could potentially become a more lucrative investment than Shopify.

The state of Shopify
Within a competitive field of e-commerce software, Shopify became the second most popular platform behind the WordPress add-on WooCommerce. According to Builtwith, Shopify claims an 18% market share versus WooCommerce's 30%. A reasonable price point, an easy-to-use platform, and vast user resources have boosted Shopify's popularity. Moreover, partnerships such as its recent deal with social media giant TikTok could drive additional sales.
Nonetheless, even as platforms such as Squarespace and Adobe's Magento have also become increasingly popular, Shopify is still just getting started in one key respect. Thanks to the Shopify Fulfillment Network (SFN), it has transcended its competition by becoming more than just a software provider.
The SFN can fill, package, and send its clients' orders through a growing network of order processing centers. Such an advantage will likely make Shopify the platform of choice for those e-commerce companies that depend heavily on product shipments.
This growing popularity helped it earn $2.1 billion in revenue in the first half of 2021. This is a 78% increase compared with the first half of 2020. Not counting a $2 billion unrealized gain from equity and other investments, Shopify reported a net income of $109 million in the first two quarters of 2021. This came in well above the $5 million reported in the first half of 2020. Shopify achieved this profit by keeping the growth in the cost of revenues and operating expenses well below the pace of revenue increases.
Nonetheless, the outlook called for rapid but slowing growth compared with 2020, declining to offer specific figures. Moreover, Shopify's 48% stock growth over the last year has taken its price-to-sales (P/S) ratio to about 50. This is well above the P/S of four for Amazon, or the P/S of five for eBay.

How eBay compares
Additionally, investors may have more reasons to consider eBay than simply a low P/S ratio. E-commerce executive Jamie Iannone returned to eBay in April 2020 after improving the performance at Walmart's Sam's Club and Walmart eCommerce.
Iannone made several changes to make eBay more user-friendly. He reduced the steps required to add listings and also added QR coding for pick-ups. Other improvements included enabling storefronts on mobile devices, adding filtering to improve the search tool, and introducing managed payments to create a digital wallet experience.
Such changes allowed eBay to prosper during the pandemic. Net income surged 25% in 2020 compared with year-ago levels after having increased by only 5% in 2019 versus 2018.
During the first half of 2021, revenue grew by 28% compared with the first two quarters of 2020 to $5.3 billion. However, by Q2, the increases slowed to 14% versus the second quarter of 2020 after experiencing a 12-month growth rate of 42% in Q1.
When not counting the $10.5 billion in income from discontinued operations, eBay earned $862 million in the first half of 2021 on $5.3 billion in revenue. Earnings from continuing operations fell from $1.1 billion in the year-ago period as higher interest costs in 2021 weighed on profits.
Nevertheless, most e-commerce companies have either seen or prepared for slowing revenue growth amid offline reopenings. Also, revenue growth remains well above the year-over-year increase of 1% in 2019, indicating that much of this growth is sustainable.
Such improvements prompted a 42% increase in the stock price over the last year, taking it to all-time highs. And this growth likely has not factored in eBay's improvements, as its aforementioned P/S ratio remains consistent with historical levels. Assuming eBay can maintain growth independent of the pandemic's influence, the stock could easily continue to set new records.
Shopify or eBay?
Although Shopify appears to hold more growth potential, valuations indicate eBay is the better buy. Admittedly, the fact that Shopify grows revenue at four times the rate of eBay makes this seem like a strange call.
Nonetheless, Shopify's sales multiple is more than 10 times higher than eBay's. Additionally, eBay generated about 2.5 times as much revenue as Shopify in the first half of 2021. Hence, even if Shopify's revenue catches up to eBay's in the foreseeable future, eBay can still attract new investors and remain a significant force in the e-commerce industry.
