Ripple (CCC:XRP-USD), the company, and its XRP coin are getting lots of attention currently as the SEC’s case against it weakens.

I recently wrote about my feeling that the SEC is simply throwing its weight around and refusing to play by the rules in that case. For that reason alone, if you’re a fan of the underdog and have a distaste for overbearing regulators, you might want to root for Ripple to prevail. 
I won’t delve into that again in this article. Rather, I’d like to try to shed some light on the company and XRP as it relates to a few common questions and misconceptions surrounding the company, the digital asset, and the project. 
Bearing that in mind, let’s start with one of the most common misconceptions. 
What Is the Difference between XRP and Ripple?
I alluded to the difference between XRP and Ripple in the first sentence of this article. But there are several distinctions between Ripple and XRP. Simply put, Ripple is the company and XRP is the digital asset. 
9 Oil & Gas Stocks to Buy to Play Rising Energy Prices
I recently watched an interview from a few months ago with Ripple CTO David Schwartz. He noted that he has been trying to clarify that difference for many years to little avail. 
He went on to explain a few other points of difference that did clarify the difference well. Ripple is simply a company a lot like any other. It is centralized, has a normal corporate power structure, shareholders, and a board of directors. You get the idea. 
XRP is a digital asset which trades on the XRP ledger. It is decentralized, publicly traded, resistant to censorship, and Ripple neither controls nor owns the XRP ledger. It is the governance structures and participants therein that dictate what happens within the XRP ledger, not Ripple. 
Why is XRP So Cheap? 
If you’ve compared the fees associated with transactions on the leading cryptocurrencies, you’ve probably noticed something: XRP is incredibly cheap. XRP’s average transaction fee is $0.000738. Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD), on the other hand, carries an average transaction fee of $4.48. Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD), a slightly better $3.08.
The reason that XRP is multiple thousands of times cheaper is competition. CTO David Schwartz explains that Bitcoin is analogous to eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) in that the company interposes itself between buyers and sellers taking some money from the transaction difference. 
XRP’s protocol doesn’t allow participants to compete for fees, keeping transaction costs much, much lower. 
Is XRP Related to XLM?
Crypto enthusiasts might have noticed that Ripple and XRP bear many similarities to Stellar Lumens (CCC:XLM-USD) and XLM. 
After all, both projects have utility in remittances and cross-border payments among other similarities. It turns out that although XLM and XRP aren’t related, there’s a good reason they’re similar. 
The reason is that Stellar was co-founded by Jed McCall, Ripple’s former CTO. The underlying technology is similar, but the projects and market perceptions of each respective project are different according to Schwartz. 
Why Then Does Ripple Own So Much XRP?
I mentioned above that Ripple and XRP are separate entities. I also mentioned that Ripple doesn’t control XRP. Yet, the company, although it doesn’t control XRP directly, owns about half of the 99.99 billion in XRP supply. 
So, although the Ripple corporate entity does not exert any direct control over the XRP ledger, Ripple does control half of the supply. This is true because the initial developers of the XRP ledger claimed significant sums of XRP early on and continue to work for Ripple. 
I continue to maintain that XRP has a bright future. Hopefully some of these answers to common questions about Ripple and XRP prove useful in understanding it moving forward.

2021-06-24 00:00:00+00:00,S.Korea retailer E-Mart to acquire 80% stake of eBay's S.Korean business for $3 bln,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/s.korea-retailer-e-mart-to-acquire-80-stake-of-ebays-s.korean-business-for-%243-bln-2021-06,,,"Adds background
SEOUL, June 24 (Reuters) - South Korean retailer Shinsegae Group's E-Mart Inc 139480.KS said on Thursday it plans to acquire 80% stake of eBay Inc's EBAY.O South Korean business for 3.4 trillion won ($3 billion), E-Mart said in a regulatory filing.
EBay will retain a 20% interest in the Korean business, whose implied value is approximately $3.8 billion, eBay said in a statement.
The transaction is expected to close by year-end or early next year, subject to regulatory approvals.
Naver Corp 035420.KS, which had previously participated in the bidding process with E-Mart, said earlier this week it pulled out of the acquisition.
EBay Korea, which was the leading e-commerce player in South Korea until 2015, saw transaction growth slow starting in 2016 due to intensified competition from the likes of Coupang CPNG.N, the current No. 1 e-commerce firm, analysts said.
Although the growth rate of South Korea's online shopping market reached 41% between 2018 and 2020, the estimated growth rate of eBay Korea's transaction price was about 4%, Samsung Securities analysts wrote in a report last week.
However, the business was still attractive to traditional retail giants including Shinsegae, which have struggled to build a leading presence in online shopping, especially after the onset of COVID-19.
EBay Korea operates the e-commerce platforms Gmarket, Auction and G9, and is the country's third-largest e-commerce firm with a market share of about 12.8% in 2020, according to Euromonitor.

2021-06-21 00:00:00+00:00,"Amazon, Major Retailers Embrace Crypto Payments",EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/amazon-major-retailers-embrace-crypto-payments-2021-06-21,,,"ZoidPay, a cryptocurrency start-up with offices in Romania, Cyprus, and Hong Kong, has launched a nifty platform that lets consumers shop and pay in crypto at over 40 million major online retailers worldwide, including Amazon, eBay, and Alibaba.
The ""Shop Anything from Anywhere with Crypto,"" team is zeroing in on an untapped market, a full-crypto payment shoppers' platform that is usable in everyday life. ZoidPay relies on a practical ecosystem designed to benefit users in every way, ensuring a smooth, enjoyable shopping experience that works with most major retailers.
Image Source: Getty Images
How ZoidPay Works
The platform features three main components to operate smoothly, a crypto payment card, digital wallet, and built-in marketplace (aka shoppers' paradise).
Its crypto card lets shoppers make contactless payments with their crypto assets, while the digital wallet lets people manage their crypto in a user-friendly environment. By the way, merchants can also use it as an mPOS (mobile point of sale) to accept crypto payments. Pretty neat.
The marketplace is a global merchants' aggregator that provides users with over $1 billion liquidity per day to spend crypto assets on major e-commerce platforms, such as Amazon.
Very simply, this means you decide how much (or how little) of your crypto you want to liquidate so that you can actually buy stuff on the marketplace.
The shopping experience itself is simple. First, users browse as a typical shopping experience, using the marketplace, even taking advantage of search filters. Then, you can add items to your cart, select your tokens from your wallet and get your virtual card issued to complete your payment.
Plans also include Google Chrome Extension integration, which allows users to buy anything from anywhere globally with their crypto simply by connecting their existing digital wallets.
As a bonus, the ZoidPay digital wallet can also be used in physical stores simply by using your smartphone as a POS (point of sale.)
ZPAY Token is one to watch
ZPAY is ZoidPay's native token and the backbone of the ZoidPay Marketplace economy, offering several benefits to users. These range from zero transaction fees to exclusive staking rewards, discounts, and of course, access to the Marketplace itself.
According to the company's whitepaper, ZPAY has a total supply of 700 million coins, with a listing price of $0.16 per coin. Thus, this is a functional token with good value and potential.
The end of Fiat?
With an ever-increasing interest in crypto payments, the MasterCard New Payments Index shows that 93% of consumers are considering crypto for their online shopping ventures.
It's start-ups like these that investors need to be keeping eyes on, this is the future of online shopping, and the market is only getting hotter.

2021-06-21 00:00:00+00:00,3 Bargain Stocks You Can Buy Today,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-bargain-stocks-you-can-buy-today-2021-06-21,,,"As an investor, do you fear being penny-wise but pound-foolish? It's certainly one of the more complicated trappings of this business. Even if you've only been an investor for a short time, you probably have an ""I shoulda been willing to pay that price after all"" story.
The fact is, however, that no two prospective trades are quite the same. There's just as much to be said for holding out for a bargain as there is for being willing to pay a premium. The key is finding the right stock for a particular price -- a bargain is only a bargain if that stock's got a good shot at increasing in value in the foreseeable future.
With this in mind, here's a closer look at three undervalued names to consider stepping into today. They're bargain stocks not just because they're cheap and have been performers of late, but also because they're stocks of companies with a bright future that not enough people are aware of -- yet.
Image source: Getty Images.
1. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals
Anyone who knows the Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: REGN) story well probably knows this year's banner growth isn't expected to continue into next year. Indeed, following this year's projected 43% top-line growth and subsequent 50% improvement in per-share earnings driven by the company's recently approved COVID-19 ""antibody cocktail,"" the analyst community is calling for a revenue and profit pullback in 2022.
While the focus has largely been on this year's sales swell, what's largely being overlooked is how much progress the company is making on other fronts despite the lingering pandemic. Its eczema drug Dupixent is nearing widened approval for more children between the ages of six and 11, while several phase 3 trials of the same drug for completely different uses were initiated. In fact, Regeneron has about 30 product candidates in the works, including several in phase 3 trials.
Next year won't be as fruitful as this year; of that there can be no doubt. It's not too soon to start looking at 2023 and beyond though, particularly in light of the fact that shares are only trading at 13 times next year's suppressed earnings projection. You're not going to find too many other biopharma stocks with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals' long-term growth prospects priced this inexpensively very often.
2. ViacomCBS
You may recall that in March, share prices of ViacomCBS (NASDAQ: VIAC) (NASDAQ: VIAC.A) were completely up-ended, falling nearly 50% in just three days. The bulk of that pullback appears to be the result of an unmet margin call from then-owner Archegos Capital Management; Archegos' broker sold the most opportune holding to bring the fund back into compliance. The company's decision to cash in on its stock's big run-up through March by selling shares via a secondary $3 billion offering, however, fanned those bearish flames.
The funny thing is, the stock's not yet recovered from this mostly artificial plunge. That's created a big opportunity.
There's no denying the world of entertainment is changing, with streaming becoming an alternative not just to conventional cable television, but to theatrical films as well. ViacomCBS isn't missing this proverbial boat, however. If anything, it's steering the boat. Its free-to-watch, ad-supported streaming television platform Pluto now boasts 50 million regular viewers worldwide, and the company's subscription-based streaming services now serve 36 million people. Both subscriber bases grew at a double-digit percentage pace last quarter.
Revenue is revving up accordingly. Even though the company is still learning the business, CEO Bob Bakish recently indicated that subscribers to its lower-cost, ad-supported streaming platform are already generating more net revenue for the company than the average cable customer does. As for Pluto, eMarketer anticipates it will generate more than $1 billion worth of ad revenue in 2022, up from less than $800 million this year and only $440 million last year. Bakish believes the company is on track to produce $7 billion worth of streaming-based revenue by 2024.
Given how well prepared the company is for what lies ahead, the forward-looking price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 10 is more than a little compelling here.
3. eBay
Finally, add eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY) to your list of bargain stocks you can buy today. Its trailing P/E ratio of 17.4 and forward-looking one of 16.7 underestimates the online auction company's growth potential.
There's no denying Amazon.com won the coronavirus-consumerism war, entering the lockdown phase of the pandemic already ready to meet the needs of shoppers no longer interested in setting foot in stores. Walmart did pretty well for itself too. eBay nabbed some new business as well, but last year's 28% revenue uptick was actually a bit of a letdown considering the environment. Lackluster guidance for the current quarter only spurred greater doubt about the company's foreseeable future.
The eBay of tomorrow, however, isn't the eBay of yesterday. The company is finally taking advantage of its smaller size and seller-powered platform to do things that Amazon and Walmart just can't.
For instance, earlier this month eBay announced it was expanding its Authenticity Guarantee service to cover luxury handbags sold via its platform. Last month the company said it would allow the sale of NFTs (non-fungible tokens) at its site. Last year eBay unveiled a certified refurbished program to support sales of office and at-home electronics. These are developments that better reflect where consumers and companies are, so to speak, and the way the world's current culture works.
eBay will never topple Amazon, but it's certainly evolving into an operation capable of solid long-term growth that its bigger rival can't really counter.

*Stock Advisor returns as of June 7, 2021
Ellen Bowman: Let's get to number 4, which is the enigma wrapped in a necessary diversification if necessary but not necessarily diversifications. Basically, this means that we're going to approach options investing differently than we're going to approach building on long-term buy-and-hold portfolio. For my long-term buy-and-hold, I'm going to want exposure all over the place, so I'm going to want to make sure that it's got a different foundation necessarily that I'm going to need to worry about here.
Jim Gillies: In all seriousness, I think Jeff Fischer, for a couple of years, did one strategy on one company.
Bowman: He wrote puts.
Gillies: He wrote puts on Facebook (NASDAQ: FB) over and over. I think that's all he did personally.
Bowman: Now, he's an absolute genius investor, but I'm pretty sure that that was the foundation of his. I'm using the word foundation a lot. I guess we're talking about foundational stuff. I remember something that he wrote for the service when he was still working on it was that people think that options are this really complicated thing. Actually, like you said, I did one strategy on one stock for years.
Gillies: But it was a stock that he knew well, so there's our evaluation first, option strategy, second. Because he knew it so well, and yeah, he only did one strategy, but he could have varied it up. I look at diversification with options as I want to find a stock I know well first, so Jeff and Facebook. Find that, you know it well. Then the diversification comes not in the stock, it comes into strategies you deploy. If I know the company well and I think the stock is undervalued, I do a bullish strategy. I don't set up a cover call which [inaudible] . If I think the stock is fairly valued, that's when I do a neutral strategy, the cover calls with Britain puts, maybe a type of spread or two. If I think the stock gets a little overexcited and gets too heated, maybe I keep with the neutral strategies but maybe with a bearish slant on it. It's the strategies that become diverse on the stock as the stock moves within your valuation corridor. But I know this stock well, and GameStop would be one of them in a previous life, as we've mentioned. But because I know it well, I can move around the diversification of the strategy rather than the stock. I don't have to go learn another stock, although I do that for a living, but I can focus here. I can just focus on this thing. Spoiler, I've been running various options strategies on some company called eBay for about the last five or six years.
Bowman: What did they do?
Gillies: Some online auctions for Beanie Babies or something. But I know the company well. Actually, it's been longer than that because my very first recommendation for Motley Fool Options, the month we launched in August of '09, was a bull call spread on eBay.
Bowman: Was eBay?
Gillies: Was eBay. Today, I'm still running strategies on eBay.

2021-06-18 00:00:00+00:00,PayPal overhauls U.S. rates as payments rivalry heats up,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/paypal-overhauls-u.s.-rates-as-payments-rivalry-heats-up-2021-06-18,,,"By Anna Irrera and David Henry
NEW YORK, June 18 (Reuters) - PayPal Holdings Inc PYPL.O will lift merchant costs for its branded payment products while cutting those for behind-the-scenes processing of some Visa and Mastercard transactions, a bold move in an increasingly competitive digital payments sector.
The strategic shift reflects PayPal's growing power in online transactions, which surged during the COVID-19 pandemic. As consumers and businesses flocked to the company, a market leader, during lockdown, its active accounts mounted to 377 million, more than twice as many as in 2015.
The company said the move reflected the value of its proprietary services, with consumers nearly three times as likely to complete a purchase when PayPal products are available at checkout, while users of the new buy-now-pay-later option spend an average of 15% more.
""We are changing prices to help our customers understand even more clearly where we provide value,"" Dan Leberman, PayPal's senior vice president for small and medium business and partners, said in an interview.
""The wallet is of tremendous value; the card processing is commoditized.""
PayPal shares were up 2.5% late Friday afternoon.
PayPal will charge sellers 3.49% plus 49 cents to process transactions made through its proprietary products, including its button on merchant websites and its digital wallet, according to material the company shared with Reuters.
The higher rate applies to products like PayPal Checkout, Pay with Venmo, PayPal Credit and new buy-now-pay-later offering Pay in 4.
PayPal has 392 million active accounts, including 31 million merchants globally, and also owns Venmo, Braintree and iZettle.
It will be hard for merchants to know how much extra value they are getting from PayPal features in exchange for the higher rates, said Ben Dwyer, the founder of cardfellow.com who analyzes processing deals offered to merchants.
""PayPal wants to be a comprehensive payment solution, but it is tough to get there by selling on value over price.""
Sellers will pay 2.59% plus 49 cents for PayPal to process, unseen by consumers, online payments made with Visa and Mastercard debit and credit cards from other companies.
In the past, PayPal charged sellers 2.9% plus 30 cents for payments on most online transactions, regardless of its role.
Lowering basic transaction processing rates helps PayPal compete with rivals including Stripe and Authorize.net. PayPal expects to acquire customers because of the discounts, Leberman said.
""We think it's a bold price to come out with,"" he said.
As large merchants tend to negotiate unique deals, rate hikes will largely affect small-to-medium sized businesses, some of which have lost confidence this year due to a nationwide labor shortage and inflation worries.
The changes largely reflect services PayPal has developed since splitting from eBay Inc EBAY.O in 2015.
Although most of its transactions are online, PayPal will also reduce prices for in-person transactions through its network, which should help it compete with Square Inc SQ.N.
For most of those purchases over $10, PayPal will charge 1.90% plus 10 cents. For cheaper buys, the rate will usually be 2.40% plus 5 cents.
PayPal's business boomed during the pandemic as more homebound consumers spent online. Itprocessed $285 billion in payments in the first quarter, up 49% from the year-earlier period.
""It's more than just pricing,"" said Aaron Press, an analyst at research company IDC. ""They are making sure the market understands that they should be thinking of PayPal as a comprehensive payments strategy and not just one form of payment.""
""Especially post pandemic, that has become very, very important.""

2021-06-18 00:00:00+00:00,"Wish Stock Is Cheap, But It’s Not a Bargain",EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/wish-stock-is-cheap-but-its-not-a-bargain-2021-06-18,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
ContextLogic (NASDAQ:WISH) is a mobile commerce company focused on North America, Europe and South American. Many analysts say that WISH stock is cheap. But they are overlooking one simple fact. The company is not profitable and does not produce free cash flow (FCF). I suspect the stock will stay cheap until it can show profits and FCF.
WISH) mobile app are displayed on a smartphone."" width=""300"" height=""169"">
Source: sdx15 / Shutterstock.com
For example, last quarter ContextLogic had sales of $772 million, up over 75% from last year. But it lost $128 million and had negative adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) of $79 million. Moreover, its FCF was negative $354 million before investments and negative $340 million after investments.
ContextLogic’s Cheap Valuation
So you can see that this does not really make investors too excited, despite its stellar growth rate. For example, WISH stock has a market value of $6.865 billion as of June 16 at a price of $11.09, according to Yahoo! Finance. But analysts covered by Seeking Alpha estimate that it will make $3.32 billion in sales in 2021 and $3.81 billion by 2022.
That puts WISH stock on a price-to-sales multiple of 2.1 times 2021 forecast sales and 1.8 times 2022 sales. This is pretty inexpensive, especially when compared to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) or even eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY).

For example, AMZN stock trades for 3.6 times 2021 sales and 3.05 times 2022 sales. Moreover, eBay is at 3.7 times 2021 sales and 3.5 times 2022 sales.
So this means that WISH stock is at about 60% of its peers’ P/S ratio for 2021 and 2022. But that 40% discount might be exactly where it should be.
The reason is Amazon and eBay are very profitable. For example, Amazon made $26.4 billion in the trailing 12 months (TTM) FCF on TTM sales of $254.5 billion. That works out to a TTM FCF margin of 10.37%. But ContextLogic had a quarterly negative 44% FCF margin (i.e., -$340 million FCF / $772 million in sales).
Ebay also had a positive FCF margin. It generated $959 million in FCF on sales of $3.023 billion. That represents a stellar FCF margin of 31.7%. So its cheap price-to-sales ratio makes it very undervalued.
So, you can see that it does not make sense to give ContextLogic a similar P/S ratio as Amazon and eBay, with their significantly higher profitability. That is just simple logic and math.
Where This Leaves WISH Stock
Analysts don’t see things my way. They are impressed with the company’s growth and think it should have a higher target price. For example, six analysts have written reports on WISH stock in the last 12 months, according to TipRanks. Their average price target is $18.60, or 66% above today’s price of $11.05.
The same is true at Seeking Alpha. Their review of 11 analysts’ reports has an average price target of $18.70. This is 68.6% over today’s price. Yahoo! Finance also has a similar price target from analysts: $18.44.
Whenever there is a wide gulf like this between my view, where I think the stock is fairly valued now, with little upside, and analysts, I use a probability matrix.
Probability Matrix
For example, let’s say that there is a good chance that analysts are right, say 40%, that it will rise 50%. Let’s say that my view, that the stock will likely stay close to its present price, also has a 40% chance of being right. And then let’s say there is a 20% chance that the stock will fall 20%, as it is still not profitable.
Here is how that works out: Scenario one: this leads to an expected return (ER) of +20% (i.e., 40% x 50%). Scenario two: this leads to a zero percent ER (i.e., 40% x 0% gain). Scenario 3: an ER of -4% (i.e., 20% x -20%). Therefore, the total expected return is +16% (i.e., +20%-0%-4%).
In other words, despite my view, the best expectation is that WISH stock will rise 16% over the next year to $12.86 (i.e., $11.09 x 1.16). That is a reasonable return, but nothing really to write home about. Keep in mind that WISH stock will not really move higher until it becomes profitable, either on an EBITDA or FCF basis.

10 stocks we like better than Nike

See the 10 stocks
*Stock Advisor returns as of June 7, 2021
Jena Greene: Nike has always played into its online presence, no matter how you feel about the company, it knows what it's doing online. That's true when it comes both the e-commerce, which has been a huge asset to Nike's overall bottom line especially over the past year, when we've all been shopping online at home from the comfort of our cellphones or treadmills. But it also is true when it comes to the news cycle. Sales declined overall during the last quarter due to supply chain constraints. But Nike's pushing the e-commerce is paid off.
The U.S. division just had its first billion-dollar quarter. But e-commerce, as I said before, is not the only way that Nike is engaging with consumers online. Remember that iconic believe in something campaign with Colin Kaepernick in 2018, the black and white social media campaign, Nike stock reached an all-time high after it hit social media. Nike stock did. In a more recent memory, Nike's March 2021 announcement that it no longer source products from Xinjiang, China, prompted a threat from Beijing to boycott the sneaker company out of existence. Its stock cratered 4% in the short term but I'm willing to believe that Nike took that risk into account, and then the stock has since recovered and management actually boosted its profitability forecast for 2021.
My overarching thesis with Nike is it knows what it's doing online, it's pushing into consumer e-commerce, it's working to alleviate the supply chain issues, and it is digging into social media forces as well. The CEO's name is John Donahoe, took over in January of 2020. He is relatively new to this business, but he knows what he's doing when it comes to e-commerce, he's on the Board of PayPal as well as ServiceNow which is Cloud computing company, its a software-as-a-service company, and he was formerly the president of eBay marketplaces, so there's no doubt that Nike knows where it wants to take its company in the next five, 10 years, and that's online, right to your doorstep, direct-to-consumer. To talk about the stock performance a little bit, year to date, it is down about 6%.
Third-quarter results were unimpressive to be expected, likely temporary. Overall sales growth was about three percent year over year, it did miss analysts expectations. Then they also saw a 10% drop in revenue. In North America, like I said before, supply chain constraints is the name of the game. From 2020 we saw that globally as coronavirus ravaged every single port around the world, but hopefully temporary. They're reporting fourth quarter earnings later this month, we expect to capture some of what the CEO called their delayed revenue from Q3 this quarter, and hopefully it will help to boost their bottom line.
Something that's noteworthy is digital sales from last quarter were up 59%. That's following an impressive performance in Q2, which was up 84%, and Q1 which was up 82%. Digital is up and to the right. The U.S., like I said before, e-commerce just had their first billion-dollar quarter. The goal ultimately is for e-commerce to account for 50% of the business, right now it's at about 35%. The question is, how does Nike execute this? How does it push people online and hopefully get more and more people on nike.com rather than buying their stuff through third-party sites.
One really interesting way that I've heard murmurs about I haven't used myself is called the SNKRS app, spelled S-N-K-R-S. They took all the vowels out because that's trendy these days, for their most loyal consumers and customers. They'll do things, if you download that app and create an account with them, they'll do things like drop sneakers early, give you insight information on what's coming out, may have exclusive promotions and sales, early releases, things like that. That has done exceedingly well, some far better than they've expected it to do. People are hungry for exclusives. The Nike brand is already so strong. If they can just pull that into their ecosystem, bring more and more people into it through an exclusive membership style basis, we've seen that that works quite well. Price-to-forward earnings is 44. It's not cheap, but that's just what, like you said before, that's when happens when it comes to blue chip stocks. You are paying for a premium here with Nike, I think it's going to do good things going forward, bullish sides ahead. It's resuming projects that were put on ice in 2020, including stock buybacks, inventory purchasing, and digging deeper into marketing and advertising spends. Like I said before, don't sleep on that one, that Kaepernick one in 2018 paid off handsomely for Nike, so I see only good things going forward.

2021-06-16 00:00:00+00:00,3 Top Stocks That Could Double Your Money,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-top-stocks-that-could-double-your-money-2021-06-16,,,"It doesn't require taking high risks to double your money in a stock. Some of the best candidates are often found among the top growth stocks that are already on everyone's radar.
Sometimes great companies fall out of favor with market participants, and that provides an opportunity to buy shares before better news sends the stock higher again. This seems to be what's happening with Unity Software (NYSE: U) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) right now.
Another example of a candidate for doubling is eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY), which is valued like a slow-growing stalwart but whose current growth suggests it deserves a higher valuation. Here's why these stocks could double within the next three to five years.

Unity Software
Unity Software is the leading platform for creating and operating interactive content, including video games. It's also seeing increasing use outside of gaming, including by engineers, architects, and filmmakers, who rely on the company's software for 3D design work.
Unity has consistently delivered revenue growth of around 40% the last few years. It makes money from selling subscriptions (Unity Pro and Unity Plus) that provide access to a software license. The company also generates revenue from in-app advertising, and provides cloud services for multiplayer video games.
Management estimates its addressable market opportunity at $29 billion, but it could be much larger than that. The company has tremendous potential to expand its software platform beyond the video game industry to other use cases, as it's already doing. Management's 2021 guidance calls for revenue to increase between 29% to 31% year over year to reach $1 billion to $1.015 billion, and it expects to maintain this level of growth over the long term.
Traditional valuation metrics like price to earnings (P/E) are going to make Unity look very expensive. That's because it is investing all its gross profit into expanding its engineering team, adding more capabilities to its software platform, and expanding its technology infrastructure.
Because Unity is fundamentally a subscription business, it should be able to significantly leverage its costs to produce healthy margins over the long term. We can already see this playing out, as its adjusted operating loss narrowed from $91 million in 2019 to $50 million in 2020. Management expects its adjusted operating profit to reach breakeven by fiscal 2023.
If Unity achieves $3.1 billion in revenue by 2026, consistent with management's long-term guidance, and the stock sells for 20 times sales, which is lower than its current price-to-sales ratio of 27, the company would have a market capitalization of $62 billion. That would deliver a double over its current market cap of $28 billion.
Unity's stock price is down 35% year to date, which potentially sets up better returns for investors who buy and hold this growth tech stock for the next three to five years.
Amazon
Amazon has gone from a small online bookseller to a massive business, with trailing-12-month sales of $419 billion. It now has more than 200 million Prime members. Given the convenience and savings Amazon provides, it's likely not even close to reaching a saturation point with Prime.
International revenue makes up only 28% of Amazon's business. There's tremendous potential to sign up more members in other markets by offering Prime Video as a gateway service into the broader Prime membership. International sales increased 50% year over year on a currency-neutral basis in the first quarter, much faster than the rest of the business. The surge in demand sent operating profit for the international segment to $1.2 billion, the fourth consecutive quarter that the once loss-prone segment turned a profit.
Most of Amazon's operating profit came from cloud services (Amazon Web Services) in 2020. The cloud segment still has many years of growth left, given that many businesses around the world are just starting their migration to cloud services to tap into more data processing, storage, and off-premise computing power. Overall, the improving profitability in the international segment and Amazon Web Services business should fuel further improvement on the bottom line.
The current consensus analyst estimate has Amazon increasing its trailing-12-month cash from operating activities to $200 per share by 2023, up from $131 per share. If Amazon continues to trade at its current price-to-cash-flow multiple of 25, which it has been for 15 years, the stock price could reach $5,000 in just the next two years, putting it well on pace to double by 2026.
Normally, analysts' price targets, which are more short-term focused, don't offer much value to the long-term investor. But it's worth noting that one analyst from Susquehanna Bancshares, a unit of Truist Financial, has a price target on the stock as high as $5,500, which seems quite reasonable when measured against Amazon's pace of growth, improving profitability, and current valuation.

eBay
eBay's business has come to life over the last year. After sluggish performance through 2019, revenue accelerated well above 20% year over year from the second quarter through the end of 2020. Revenue increased 42% year over year for the first quarter of 2021.
Investors don't think that rate will last. The stock currently sells for a modest P/E of 16.9, but that might be severely undervaluing eBay's renewed emphasis on delivering strong growth under CEO Jamie Iannone, who took over as chief executive in April 2020.
eBay saw its active buyer growth accelerate during the pandemic to 7% year over year, and management is capitalizing on that momentum by expanding into several new product categories, including authenticated sneakers, luxury watches, trading cards, and item customization. That last category is taking a page out of Etsy's playbook, with eBay starting to offer sellers the capability to provide personalized goods across the home, fashion, and jewelry categories.
Management's guidance calls for revenue growth in the second quarter to be between 8% to 10% on a currency-neutral basis. Analysts expect eBay to finish 2021 with revenue 17% higher over the prior year, before falling back to single-digit gains by 2023. However, over the next five years, the consensus analyst estimate has earnings per share increasing at an annualized rate of 13%, which would push the stock price close to a double without any allowance for a possible increase in the stock's P/E multiple.
Iannone continues to sell off eBay's noncore assets -- such as the current deal to have Adevinta buy its Classified business -- and return capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. As a result, the company could see its valuation multiple gradually drift higher, since investors love companies that focus on increasing shareholder returns. If eBay's P/E multiple stretches closer to 20 times earnings to reflect the improved growth outlook, which would still be below the average multiple of the S&P 500 index, its stock could double in value.

SEOUL, June 16 (Reuters) - EBay EBAY.O will sell its South Korean business to retailer Shinsegae Group's E-Mart Inc 139480.KS and web portal operator Naver 035420.KS for about 4 trillion won ($3.6 billion), local newspapers reported on Wednesday.
EBay Korea is the country's third-largest e-commerce firm with market share of about 12.8% in 2020, according to Euromonitor. It operates the platforms Gmarket, Auction and G9.
E-Mart said in a regulatory filing on Wednesday that it was talking with eBay Inc after entering a binding bid for acquiring eBay Korea this month, but that nothing had been finalised.
Naver and eBay Korea declined to comment.
Lotte Shopping 023530.KS had also been in the running, the Korea Economic Daily and other newspapers said, citing unnamed investment banking sources.
South Korea represents the world's fourth largest e-commerce market. Driven by the coronavirus pandemic, e-commerce has soared to account for 35.8% of the retail market in 2020 compared with 28.6% in 2019, according to Euromonitor data.
Shinsegae and Naver formed a retail and e-commerce partnership in March by taking stakes worth 250 billion won in each other's affiliates.

The stock has rocketed up sevenfold since the split and it doesn't seem to be slowing down. Furthermore, the pandemic has been a tailwind for this e-commerce digital payments platform as it continues to put up solid double-digit growth on the top and bottom lines. On a Fool Live episode recorded on May 26, Fool contributors Toby Bordelon and Brian Withers discuss the most recent quarter and whether this digital payments leader is a no-brainer buy for investors.
10 stocks we like better than PayPal Holdings
When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, Motley Fool Stock Advisor, has tripled the market.*
David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now... and PayPal Holdings wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys.
See the 10 stocks
*Stock Advisor returns as of June 7, 2021
Toby Bordelon: Let's talk about PayPal. Great company. This is a great company, continued to perform well. The last quarter was good. Revenue increase of 31%, operating income up 84%. Now, both of those are good numbers, right? But that operating income increased almost three times revenue on a percentage basis. I love that. Because that reveals an ability to keep their costs down and to grow their margins as they grow revenue. What does that mean? They're not paying up for growth. They are growing very efficiently and that is what you want to see from any company. Great job there.
Cash flow up 24%. Really great. Up to $1.76 billion, I think, for operating cash flow. It's a cash machine here. Management has some bold ambitions. They have about 400 million users. They were less than 400 million users today. They want that to be 750 million in the next four years. They are looking to hit one billion transactions per day as a long-term goal. That would be impressive.
We did a deep dive on this company last week, I think, Brian Withers, I'm remembering. I think if they came out to me as I was studying for that is that the payment space is very competitive. The electronic transfer space is very competitive. It's only getting more competitive. But PayPal keeps on delivering. They keep growing. They keep innovating. They keep staying in the mix with everyone who comes in to try to compete here, and they're right there at the top. I foresee big things to come for them and I would be very happy to continue to be a shareholder in this company despite the increasing competition.
Brian Withers: Thanks for that, Toby. I ran across PayPal this morning. I was at my doctor's office and they had a PayPal little card reader to take my payment. It was hooked up to their computer and made it super easy to pay them [laughs] and take the money from my credit card. PayPal seems to be firing on all cylinders. Is it a no-brainer buy right now for investors?
Bordelon: I wouldn't necessarily call it a no-brainer. I mean, the growth has been great. The stock price has moved up, too. There is that. I think that it is a key part of e-commerce and digital payments. If you're going to invest in that space, you're going to make that part of your portfolio, yeah, I think you're going to be in PayPal. I think you want PayPal. I think that's an obvious company to put within a basket in that electronic money if you want to think of it that way, electronic payments.
Not necessarily for everyone, but certainly, if you were looking at the kind of payment space, you're going to want to have it as an anchor part of that part of your portfolio.

2021-06-15 00:00:00+00:00,Value Buy Alibaba Stock Offers Long-Term Growth Potential,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/value-buy-alibaba-stock-offers-long-term-growth-potential-2021-06-15,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
One of the great China growth stories in recent memory has been Alibaba Group (NYSE:BABA). Since its IPO in September 2014, BABA stock has been the face of Chinese consumer growth and created many billionaires in the process.
BABA) logo on the side of a glass-walled building."" width=""300"" height=""169"">

Alibaba has alternately been called the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Ebay ( NASDAQ:EBAY), Paypal (NASDAQ:PYPL) and even Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) of China as it spans many avenues of consumer spending and technology. BABA operates leading online marketplaces such as Taobao and TMall as well as B2B sties throughout China. Revenues are derived from commissions, marketing services, subscription fees, cloud computing and software operations, and logistics services.
The company also owns retails chains, and partners with “logistics and payment companies to offer delivery, warehousing, payment & financing services for its users and merchants.”  It also has a 33% stake in Ant Technology.
What’s the Value of BABA Stock?
BABA’s valuation isn’t stretched, as it trades at just 18 times 2022 consensus estimates. Regulatory overhangs, a failed ANT Group IPO, and questions about their plans for physical retails stores have dragged BABA stock down to $213 from October 2020 highs of $319.

7 Retail Stocks That You Don't Want In Your Cart
This drop-off led legendary investor Charlie Munger to take a stake through his thinly-traded controlled company Daily Journal (NASDAQ:DJCO). Famous investor Mohnish Pabrai who manages hedge fund Pabrai Funds, disclosed that he initiated a position in BABA the first quarter of 2021.
About the ANT Group IPO
ANT Group, which is 33% owned by Alibaba, is a fintech and payments company that runs the Alipay app. ANT was set to go public in April of this year, but the IPO was pulled by Chinese regulators at the last minute. Wall Street Journal said in part:
“… the ongoing probe is looking into the regulators who approved the listing, local officials who promoted the listing, and the large state firms that would financially benefit from the offering.”
The value of this 33% stake in the public markets will be material to BABA’s overall valuation. Compared with PayPal, which trades at 45 times its 2022 consensus estimate, BABA’s overall forward multiple of 18 is less than half, suggesting plenty of room for this stock to grow.
There is no definitive word on when ANT will try to go public again, but I suspect it will be sometime this year.
Alibaba’s Outlook Is Promising
Long-term I believe Alibaba will remain the top e-commerce and cloud platform in China. It has industry leadership that will be hard to duplicate and surpass.  In addition, its B2B segments offer a diverse array of opportunities that may not be correlated with its consumer-driven businesses.
In todays investing world where the market is seeing the highest level of unprofitable companies in history, it’s refreshing to see a strong growth story that also carries high margins and decent returns on capital.

2021-06-07 00:00:00+00:00,7 Wide-Moat Stocks to Buy if You’re a Fan of Warren Buffett,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/7-wide-moat-stocks-to-buy-if-youre-a-fan-of-warren-buffett-2021-06-07,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Legendary investor Warren Buffett suggests investors put their faith and capital in companies with “wide moats” that give these businesses sustainable competitive advantages. Therefore, today’s article introduces seven wide-moat Warren Buffett stocks to buy in June.
“The billionaire investor said one type of competitive advantage is when a company is the low-cost producer due to economies of scale or a better business model,” CNBC.com reported. “The second type of competitive advantage is when a company owns a powerful product franchise or brand that consumers are willing to pay up for…”
In addition to the seven stocks discussed later, there are also several exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that Buffett could like. These funds include:
The VanEck Vectors Morningstar Wide Moat ETF (BATS:MOAT) – up 18% year-to-date (YTD), and all of the businesses come from the U.S.;
VanEck Vectors Morningstar Global Wide Moat (BATS:GOAT) – up 12% YTD, and about 41% of businesses are located outside the U.S.;
VanEck Vectors Morningstar International Moat ETF (BATS:MOTI) – up 11% YTD, and only 4% of firms come from the U.S.
Recent research by Srinidhi Kanuri of the University of Southern Mississippi in Hattiesburg, Mississippi, and Robert W. McLeod of the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, suggests, “Companies that have sustainable competitive advantages should be able to create a barrier (Moat) to prevent or lessen competition from other firms. The wider the Moat the greater the barrier and the more secure the company’s profitability.”
With that information, here are seven stocks with strong moats:
Bank of America (NYSE:BAC)
BlackRock (NYSE:BLK)
eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY)
General Motors (NYSE:GM)
Kellogg (NYSE:K)
Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT)
Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA)
Warren Buffett Stocks: Bank of America (BAC)

Leading the list of Warren Buffett stocks, Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of America is one of the largest financial institutions stateside, with more than $2.9 trillion in assets. It operates under four segments: consumer banking, global wealth and investment management, global banking and global markets.
The company announced its first-quarter results in mid-April. Total revenue was $22.8 billion. Net profit of $8.1 billion translated into earnings-per-share (EPS) of 86 cents. A year ago, these metrics had been $4.0 billion and 40 cents.
“While low interest rates continued to challenge revenue, credit costs improved and we believe that progress in the health crisis and the economy point to an accelerating recovery,” CEO Brian Moynihan said. “The strength of our balance sheet, our complementary and diverse set of businesses, and our talented teammates position us to perform well in that environment.”
YTD Bank of America shares returned more than 42% and recently hit a multi-year high. The stock’s forward price-to-earnings (P/E) and price-to-book (P/B) ratios stand at 15.20 and 1.45, respectively. The strengthening economic recovery is likely to provide further momentum to the shares. Potential investors could regard any decline toward $40 as a potential entry point.
BlackRock (BLK)

BlackRock is the largest asset manager in the world, with more than $9 trillion in assets under management.  The company’s iShares ETF platform maintains a leading market share domestically and on a global basis. More than one-third of managed assets come from investors living outside the U.S. and Canada.
In mid-April, BlackRock released Q1 results. BLK’s revenues reached $4.4 billion, up 19% year-over-year (YoY). Management cited strong organic growth, higher performance fees and 12% growth in technology services revenue. Net income grew by 16% YoY and came at $1.2 billion. Diluted EPS was $7.77. A year ago, it had been $6.60.
“We generated a record $172 billion of total net inflows in the quarter, our fourth consecutive quarter with over $100 billion of net inflows,” CEO Laurence D. Fink said. “Flows represented 8% annualized organic asset and a record 14% annualized organic base fee growth, as clients contributed $59 billion to BlackRock’s active platform and demand remained strong for ETFs and cash. Consistently strong results, including 14% organic base fee growth over the last twelve months, reflect the benefits of our investments over time.”
Analysts concurred that the results were impressive. So far in 2021, BLK stock is up 22%, hovering at an all-time high. Forward P/E and current P/B ratios of 23.64 and 3.78 point to a expensive valuation level by historic standards. A potential decline toward $860 would improve the margin of safety.
Warren Buffett Stocks: eBay (EBAY)

Global e-commerce platform eBay needs little introduction. Its segments include marketplace and classifieds. With $100 billion in marketplace gross merchandise volume generated in 2020, that segment facilitated more than 2% of the $4.3 trillion global online commerce market. 
The company reported first-quarter results on April 28. Revenue was $3 billion, up 38% YoY. Adjusted net income was $758 million, representing a 45% increase from $522 million in the prior year period. Adjusted earnings per diluted share came at $1.09, an impressive 59% increase from 69 cents a year ago. The company generated $938 million of operating cash flow and $855 million of free cash flow from continuing operations.
“We delivered another strong quarter for the company and an excellent start to the year for our buyers and sellers,” CEO Jamie Iannone said. “We generated tremendous volume and earnings, with revenue growth the highest it has been since 2005.”
Investors were impressed with the results, cash flow generated, and the overall strength of the balance sheet. YTD, the shares are up 27.5% and hit a record high in April. EBAY stock’s forward P/E ratio and price-to-sales (P/S) ratios are 15.04 and 3.74, respectively. Any potential decline toward $60 would improve the risk/return profile for long-term investors. 
General Motors (GM)

Legacy automaker General Motors has had a great year during the months of the pandemic. It is the market leader in the U.S. with 17.3% share in 2020. As most InvestorPlace.com readers would well know, it manufactures vehicles under the Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet, GMC, Baojun and Wuling brands.
The group also plans to launch 30 electric vehicle (EV) models globally by 2025. Analysts concur that its autonomous vehicle subsidiary Cruise also carries significant long-term potential. The move toward an electric future is likely to become a secular shift in the coming quarters.
General Motors reported strong first-quarter results in early May. Revenue was roughly flat YoY at $32.5 billion, largely due to production constraints related to the semiconductor shortage. Adjusted net income was $4.4 billion, compared to $1.2 billion in the prior year quarter. Adjusted earnings per diluted share was $2.25.
“These strong results demonstrate once again the underlying strength of our business, especially in North America and China, and at GM Financial,” CEO Mary Barra said. “We continue to execute our strategy and make significant progress on our transition to an all-electric future with the growth opportunities it creates.”
YTD, General Motor shares have returned more than 50% and saw a record high in recent days. Strong consumer spending provided tailwinds for the stock. GM’s forward P/E and P/S ratios stand at 11.07 and 0.69, respectively. Interested investors could consider buying the dips in price.

Kellogg is one of the leading names in the consumer staples industry. It manufactures cereal, cookies, crackers and other packaged foods. Its products are marketed in more than 180 countries. Several of the well-known brands include Special K, Frosted Flakes, Froot Loops, Pringles, Rice Krispies and Pop-Tarts.
The group announced its Q1 figures at the beginning of May. Net sales rose 5.1% YoY to $3,584 million. Currency adjusted diluted EPS was $1.07, showing a 8.1% YoY growth. Operating cash flow was at $235 million.
“The quarter featured continued momentum in major brands and categories, accelerated growth in emerging markets,” CEO Steve Cahillane commented said. “This strong start to the year enables us to raise our full-year financial outlook, and underscores confidence in our ability to sustain balanced financial delivery.”
Hence, management revised its full year guidance. Kellogg now expects flat organic sales growth in 2021 versus a decline of 1% in previous guidance. Currency adjusted diluted EPS is estimated to increase by approximately 1% to 2% YoY at the end of 2021.
Analysts found the results and levels of cash generated impressive. Since the start of the year, K stock returned more than 7%. Forward P/E and current P/S ratios are 16.34 and 1.62, respectively. Those investors looking for dividend shares might want to put Kellogg on their radar screen. The company has enough cash to potentially increase dividends as well as to reduce debt in future years.

Bethesda, Maryland-based Lockheed Martin is one of the most important global security and aerospace companies. It operates in four business segments: aeronautics; missiles and fire control (MFC); rotary and mission systems (RMS); and space.
Over decades, management invested in technological innovation, giving it a significant barriers-to-entry competitive advantage. The company has strong relationships with the Department of Defense that provide long-term contract cycles.
Lockheed Martin announced its Q1 figures on April 20. LMT’s top line grew by 4% YoY to $16.26 billion. Net profit of $1.85 billion meant an increase of 2.82%. Diluted EPS improved from the Q1 2020 level of $6.08 to $6.56 in Q1 2021.
“Lockheed Martin continues to deliver vital next generation technologies that will help keep our nation and its allies safe, and advance space exploration, while providing long-term value for the U.S. taxpayers and our shareholders,” CEO James Taiclet said.
Following the earnings release, the company revised its 2021 outlook upward. Net sales are now expected to be in the $67,300 to $68,700 million range versus the 2020 number of $65,398 million. Diluted EPS guidance for the full year is at $26.40 to $26.70 band versus the 2020 figure of $24.30.
YTD, shares of the defense giant have returned close to 10%. Forward P/E and current P/S ratios are 14.39 and 1.62, respectively. I believe an investment in LMT stock around these levels could provide significant long-term upside.

Chip giant Nvidia’s development of the graphics processing unit (GPU) in 1999 sparked the growth of the PC gaming market. Since then, its products have been part of computer graphics, high performance computing and artificial intelligence (AI). The developments in AI are reshaping many industries, including transportation, healthcare and manufacturing. As a result, Nvidia’s chips are highly sought after.
In late May, the group released its first-quarter results for fiscal 2022. For financial reporting, the company’s fiscal year ends on Jan. 30. Revenue grew by 84% YoY to $5.66 billion. Net income was up 107% YoY and came at $2.31 billion. Diluted EPS more than doubled YoY, and increased from the $1.80 level achieved in Q1 FY21 to $3.66 in Q1 FY22. Cash and equivalents stood at $978 million.
“We had a fantastic quarter, with strong demand for our products driving record revenue,” CEO Jensen Huang said.
For the second quarter of fiscal 2022, the company expects to generate around $6.30 billion in revenue.
YTD, Nvidia stock is up 30% and hit an all-time high in June. Forward P/E and current P/S ratios of 42.74 and 21.28, respectively. Although the valuation is on the frothy side by historical measures, investors are willing to pay for the company’s growth prospects. After all, its products are part of the global digital transformation we’re witnessing.

2021-06-07 00:00:00+00:00,S.Korean retail firms Lotte and Shinsegae bid for eBay Korea,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/s.korean-retail-firms-lotte-and-shinsegae-bid-for-ebay-korea-2021-06-07,,,"SEOUL, June 7 (Reuters) - South Korean retailers Lotte Shopping 023530.KS and Shinsegae Group 023530.KS entered separate binding bids for eBay's EBAY.O South Korean business, the retailers' spokesmen said on Monday.
eBay Korea - South Korea's third-largest e-commerce firm with a 12.8% market share in 2020, according to Euromonitor - is on sale for what eBay hopes could be up to 5 trillion won ($4.5 billion), analysts said.
The retailers' spokesmen declined to comment on the terms of their bids. An eBay Korea spokeswoman also declined to comment.
Local retail giants Lotte and Shinsegae have struggled to catch up to leading competitors like South Korea's No. 1 e-commerce firm Coupang CPNG.N in the fast-growing online shopping sector, especially after the onset of COVID-19.
South Korea's online shopping transactions were worth 161 trillion won in 2020, accounting for a record 27.2% of total retail transactions, up from 21.4% in 2019.

2021-06-06 00:00:00+00:00,Switch Sales Lead the Way for Nintendo,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/switch-sales-lead-the-way-for-nintendo-2021-06-06,,,"Nintendo's (OTC: NTDOY) latest gaming console, the Switch, first debuted in 2017. With the pace of technology, it would seem that a four-year-old console would be on its last legs, but that's not the case at all. On a Fool Live episode recorded on May 12, Fool contributors Toby Bordelon and Brian Withers discuss the tremendous success it had with its console platform this past year and what investors should be thinking about going forward with this gaming platform company.
10 stocks we like better than Nintendo
When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, Motley Fool Stock Advisor, has tripled the market.*
David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now... and Nintendo wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys.
See the 10 stocks
*Stock Advisor returns as of May 11, 2021
Toby Bordelon: Nintendo had a great quarter, too. Well, this is actually their fiscal year. They're on a not a calendar year basis and this last quarter was the end of their fiscal year. Switch sales, their new handheld gaming console, up 37%, and that translates to 29 million units sold versus 21 last year. Game sales also up 37%. If you've been paying attention to the gaming market during the pandemic, Animal Crossing leading the way. No surprise there.
Revenue up 35%, operating profit, they report in yen, but it translates to about $4.4 billion. Great, they had a strong, solid quarter. My issue, what I alluded to back on the question to Brian was you got Switch sales, we got game sales, things that really work when you're holed up in your house and can't go anywhere. Does this continue post-pandemic? That's my wildcard for them. I don't know. We're going to have to see that. I think a lot of this is pandemic-driven increases, but it's still a very popular device so we could still see some legs here.
Brian Withers: Yeah, we're a Nintendo household too, Toby. The question is another fill-in-the-blank. The most exciting product from Nintendo is blank.
Bordelon: Let's say based on what we've seen this past couple years, got to be the Switch. That has been driving their growth. You couldn't find it. If you try to get one on Amazon on eBay, you were paying double, triple the price. Their problem was not making enough fast enough to sell. That's definitely the one.
Now interestingly, we've got rumors of a higher-end version coming later this year. That could help Nintendo compete against Microsoft and Sony who have recently announced new consoles themselves. Different ballpark, different market really. But they could hold their own with a higher-end Switch, especially if we're seeing supply chain issues on Microsoft and Sony, too. That's a theme with all these companies in manufacturing. But yeah, look for that new version. If they launch that this year, maybe the party keeps going a little bit longer. We'll see.
Withers: Both of my kids have a Switch. It's a huge leap forward from their last console for sure.
