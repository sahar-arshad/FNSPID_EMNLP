2021-12-17 00:00:00+00:00,First Week of March 2022 Options Trading For eBay Inc. (EBAY),EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/first-week-of-march-2022-options-trading-for-ebay-inc.-ebay,,,"Investors in eBay Inc. (Symbol: EBAY) saw new options begin trading this week, for the March 2022 expiration. One of the key inputs that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 91 days until expiration the newly trading contracts represent a potential opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the EBAY options chain for the new March 2022 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $62.50 strike price has a current bid of $3.45. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $62.50, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $59.05 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of EBAY, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $64.40/share today.
Because the $62.50 strike represents an approximate 3% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 60%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 5.52% return on the cash commitment, or 22.15% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for eBay Inc., and highlighting in green where the $62.50 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $65.00 strike price has a current bid of $4.10. If an investor was to purchase shares of EBAY stock at the current price level of $64.40/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $65.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 7.30% if the stock gets called away at the March 2022 expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if EBAY shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for eBay Inc., as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing EBAY's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $65.00 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $65.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 49%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 6.37% boost of extra return to the investor, or 25.55% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.
The implied volatility in the put contract example is 36%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 35%.
Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $64.40) to be 33%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

2021-12-17 00:00:00+00:00,4 Top E-Commerce Stocks To Watch In December 2021,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/4-top-e-commerce-stocks-to-watch-in-december-2021,,,"Top E-commerce Stocks For Your List This Month
The stock market has seen the rise of various industries over the past few years. Some of which greatly benefitted from the global pandemic that has kept people in their homes for long durations. An example of this would be e-commerce stocks that have been gaining popularity over the years. That said, the industry has been booming even before the coronavirus pandemic crisis. The idea of hassle-free shopping by clicking on a few buttons is just too enticing for shoppers. Furthermore, the pandemic has addressed whatever doubts that people had with e-commerce as many were forced to make purchases online. Since then, the adoption of e-commerce has skyrocketed. 
For instance, Southeast Asia’s leading ride-hailing and food delivery firm Grab (NASDAQ: GRAB) said this week that it is acquiring Malaysian supermarket chain Jaya Grocer. This appears to be part of Grab’s plan to scale up its grocery delivery business. Elsewhere, Latin American e-commerce giant MercadoLibre (NASDAQ: MELI) announced the acquisition of Redelcom earlier this week. Redelcom is a Chilean payment services provider of high-tech point-of-sale terminals focusing on small businesses. With that, MercadoLibre seems to be taking interest in smaller upcoming names in the region. Safe to say, the e-commerce space does not lack exciting developments for consumers and investors alike. With that said, here is a list of top e-commerce stocks to watch in the stock market now. 
Best E-commerce Stocks To Watch In December 2021
Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN)
eBay Inc (NASDAQ: EBAY)
Target Corporation (NYSE: TGT)
Global-E Online Ltd (NASDAQ: GLBE)
Amazon.com
First, on the list, we have the global e-commerce giant, Amazon. With the massive scale and reach of its online shopping division, Amazon is often the first to come to mind when thinking about e-commerce companies. In addition, it provides services such as advertising to sellers. Amazon’s vast operations also include cloud computing and video streaming, among others. 
Last month, the company announced plans for three new operations facilities in Alabama. In conjunction with that, Amazon also celebrates the launch of its new fulfillment center that will support customers across the state. Hence, Amazon has now created more than 9,000 direct jobs statewide and invested more than $1 billion in Alabama infrastructure. Also, the fulfillment and transportation jobs support communities of all sizes and offer wages that are more than double the federal-state minimum. 
Investors should also note that the company’s cloud services have been expanding rapidly. For instance, Amazon Web Services announced earlier this week the launch of the AWS Asia Pacific (Jakarta) Region. So, developers, startups, as well as governments can now run their applications and serve end-users from data centers located in Indonesia. These will leverage advanced AWS technologies to drive innovation. All things considered, is AMZN stock a buy right now?

eBay
Following that, we have another global e-commerce company, eBay. Essentially, the company’s technology allows sellers worldwide to offer their inventory for sale virtually anytime and anywhere. Its platforms are accessible through a traditional online experience, mobile devices, and its application programming interfaces. Notably, EBAY stock has risen more than 25% since the start of the year. 
November was a month packed with exciting developments for eBay. For starters, it announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Sneaker Con’s authentication business. Sneaker Con is a leading sneaker authenticator with operations in the U.S., U.K., Canada, Australia, and Germany. The acquisition is important for eBay as it has been critical to powering the company’s Authenticity Guarantee. In fact, more than 1.55 million sneakers have been authenticated globally on eBay in over a year. 
Furthermore, the company also launched eBay Refurbished. This is a new destination where shoppers can discover refurbished items from brands like Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Samsung, and Dyson. Also, there will be a one- or two-year warranty for all these products. Shoppers need not worry as there is a thorough vetting process that ensures every item meets eBay’s high-performance standards. Given these exciting developments, would you consider adding EBAY stock to your watchlist?
Target
Target is a general merchandise retailer offering a variety of products across several categories, including household essentials, food and beverage, and apparel. With over 1,900 stores in the nation, the company estimates that 75% of the U.S. population lives within 10 miles of a Target store. TGT stock has been up by over 30% just this year alone.
During the third quarter, Target recorded total revenue of $25.7 billion, an increase of 13.3% from the same period last year. One of the key contributors was digital sales, which grew 29% year-over-year. In fact, it’s worth pointing out that online sales has now risen to a commendable 17.6% of total sales. And this is arguably the fruits of Target’s labor in digital transformation.
In October, Target announced its limited-edition collection with the LEGO Group. In brief, the collection features a lifestyle assortment of joyful, colorful items. Certainly, the company was able to seize the opportunity to create something special for its customers ahead of the holiday season. With all these in mind, would you consider TGT stock as a top e-commerce stock to watch?

Global-E Online
To sum up the list, we have the Israel-based company, Global-E. Essentially, it provides an e-commerce platform that enables direct-to-consumer cross-border e-commerce. This means that retailers and brands can increase their international traffic conversion and sales through the company’s platform. Impressively, GLBE stock has more than doubled its value over the past year.
Recently, the company announced that it will be acquiring Flow Commerce, a tech-based cross-border e-commerce software solution for emerging brands. This move would strengthen Global-E’s offering and capabilities as it allows the company to access additional addressable markets of small merchants. By leveraging Flow’s robust API-based tech, the company will be well-positioned to provide small merchants with a best-in-class solution. 
On top of that, Global-E has also just come off a strong third quarter. During the quarter, the company posted a gross merchandise value of $352 million, an increase of 86% from the prior year’s quarter. Also, its revenue for the quarter was $59.1 million, up 77% year-over-year. All this is testament to the company’s strong business momentum as it continues to perform at record-breaking levels. Therefore, should you be keeping a close tab on GLBE stock now?

2021-12-16 00:00:00+00:00,Could This New Partnership Help Realogy Grow Its Bottom Line?,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/could-this-new-partnership-help-realogy-grow-its-bottom-line,,,"Real estate brokerage company Realogy (NYSE: RLGY) recently announced a new partnership with Sotheby's (NYSE: BID) to help build out its business at the higher end of the real estate market. In this Fool Live video clip, recorded on Nov. 19, Fool.com contributors Matt Frankel and Jason Hall, along with editor Deidre Woollard, discuss the news and what it could mean for the company.
10 stocks we like better than Realogy Holdings Corp.
When our award-winning analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, Motley Fool Stock Advisor, has tripled the market.*
They just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now... and Realogy Holdings Corp. wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys.
See the 10 stocks
*Stock Advisor returns as of November 10, 2021
Matt Frankel: Deidre sent me this news earlier. It's Realogy is partnering with Sotheby's. When I see Realogy is partnering with somebody, I always think back to remember when they partnered with Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) a few years ago and that ended up going nowhere?
Deidre Woollard: Yeah, that didn't work out very well.
Frankel: Yes. That was, no offense to Sotheby's, but Amazon is the bigger deal out of the two. Everybody was really excited about that and it ended up going nowhere. I know ""this time is different,"" is the worst thing you can hear in investing. But it definitely seems like that might be the case. Deidre, why don't you tell us a little bit about what this means?
Woollard: Well, I love Realogy. Certainly, the stock has taken it on the chin in recent years. I remember The Real Deal writing that you could get a share of stock for a cup of coffee at one point. It's better now, it's around $16, but it's not back when it used to be close to $50, like in the beginning of the decade. This deal, Realogy already has an arrangement with Sotheby's anyway, because they have, Sotheby's International Realty is a Realogy brand.
But they're partnering on a deal with buying Concierge or 80% of Concierge Auction. What Concierge Auctions is, it's luxury estate auctions. It was born out of the great financial crisis and certainly out of all of the properties that were up for sale in Florida and other areas. It's grown steadily over time. Full disclosure, I used to be part of their PR team for awhile, so it's a company I've known for awhile and I am a fan of.
Last year, they did around $3.5 billion in competitive bids. Their average home sold for like $3.5 million, but they've sold for far more than that. Then they sell internationally. They've ran into some controversy over the years about some of the pricing and things like that.
But overall, I think this is an interesting thing because we don't talk a lot about auctions in real estate, but it absolutely is a thing that happens, not just at the courthouse steps thing. Concierge has grown over time. I think this is a pretty smart deal.
It also shows me that Realogy is really thinking about just carving out the luxury end of the market. Most of their earnings are really coming from there lately. They're also doubling down on their Corcoran brand. They're really trying to expand that luxury end of the market, and I think that's why their earnings have been pretty strong the last couple of quarters. Does it worry me because luxury gets hit when things shift? A little bit, but I still like this deal.
Frankel: Yeah. I would agree. There's such kind of a negative connotation when you hear the word auction in real estate. It sounds like they're almost trying to become the eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY) of real estate in terms of having an auction style business model, which in a market like we're seeing today, makes total sense. I promise if some of these homes that you are seeing fly off the market in a day or two were put up for auction, the seller would make a lot more money. It makes sense.
I hope they don't just do it at the high-end of the market. I think that would be a mistake, I think that would be a very cyclical business. The auction model definitely makes sense, especially if you can cut out some of the middlemen involved in real estate transactions. I like this deal. I think that it's great brand recognition in terms of the auction space. It brings that high-end mentality to something that generally has a low-end mentality, like you mentioned the courthouse steps auctions.
It's something that a lot of investors or even pretty sophisticated real estate investors don't understand. I consider myself pretty well-versed real estate investor. I wouldn't want to show up at the courthouse steps for a property auction and pretend I know what I was doing.
Hall: Heck, no.
Frankel: It could really bring the concept of real estate auctions to the masses, and I think that can be a very valuable thing.
Woollard: It's interesting, because a lot of what Concierge does is, they have a really solid database of luxury buyers around the world, so they get repeat buyers and things like that. I don't know how easy it would be to take their model to the middle level, but it does make sense. It would be like just expanding what they do now because you're absolutely right. The amount of people that are buying houses in one or two days has increased dramatically. The amount of people that buy sight unseen keeps going up, and so there's really a lot of potential there.

2021-12-14 00:00:00+00:00,"UK lawmakers call for tougher crackdown on online scammers, cyberflashing",EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/uk-lawmakers-call-for-tougher-crackdown-on-online-scammers-cyberflashing,,,"By Huw Jones
LONDON, Dec 14 (Reuters) - Google, Facebook and other online services should be held legally accountable for advertisements on their platforms in order to prevent fraudsters scamming millions of consumers, a cross-party group of British lawmakers has said.
Britain has proposed a landmark online safety law to punish abuses such as child pornography, racism and violence against women, but a joint committee of lawmakers drawn from both houses of parliament said on Tuesday it should go a step further to cover paid-for adverts.
""Excluding paid-for advertising will leave service providers with little incentive to remove harmful adverts, and risks encouraging further proliferation of such content,"" the joint committee report said.
The Financial Conduct Authority also wants adverts on social media and search engines, currently excluded from the draft law, to be included after 754 million pounds ($999.65 million) was stolen from consumers in the first six months of this year.
The report also backed a Law Commission recommendation to make cyberflashing, or the unsolicited sending of obscene images or video recordings, which are often a feature of sexual harassment, illegal.
The draft law is due to be approved in 2022 and government has two months to say if it will back the recommendation, along with several others which lawmakers say are needed to ""call time on the Wild West online"".
""The era of self-regulation for big tech has come to an end. The companies are clearly responsible for services they have designed and profit from, and need to be held to account for the decisions they make,"" said Damian Collins, who chairs the joint committee.
Britain's communications regulator Ofcom should have powers to police mandatory codes of practice for the internet service providers and punish breaches, the report said. There must, however, be ""robust protections"" for freedom of expression, including an automatic exemption for recognised news publishers, it added.
Britain's financial services minister John Glen said last month he was ""very sympathetic"" to introducing online adverts into the bill or similar action.
Vim Maru, group director of retail banking at Lloyds LLOY.L said fraud is now Britain's most common crime and supported including paid-for online adverts in the bill.
""The proposed legislation is a golden opportunity to take on the fraudsters together,"" Maru said.
The FCA spent 600,000 pounds on Google to warn about scam adverts, though the online giant has since said it will only take adverts from firms regulated by the FCA, and offered a $3 million credit to the regulator.
""Without a decisive response from the government and the tech giants, many more individuals will sadly fall victim to these scammers,"" said Mel Stride, chair of parliament's treasury committee, which backs the recommendation to help remove fraudulent online adverts.
Geraint Lloyd-Taylor, a partner at the Lewis Silkin law firm, said the draft law leaves many unanswered questions and clearly poses a threat to democratic freedoms by introducing a new form of censorship without clear boundaries and safeguards.

2021-12-13 00:00:00+00:00,June 2022 Options Now Available For eBay,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/june-2022-options-now-available-for-ebay,,,"Investors in eBay Inc. (Symbol: EBAY) saw new options become available today, for the June 2022 expiration. One of the key data points that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 186 days until expiration the newly available contracts represent a potential opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the EBAY options chain for the new June 2022 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $65.00 strike price has a current bid of $4.95. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $65.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $60.05 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of EBAY, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $66.81/share today.
Because the $65.00 strike represents an approximate 3% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 59%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 7.62% return on the cash commitment, or 14.95% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for eBay Inc., and highlighting in green where the $65.00 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $67.50 strike price has a current bid of $5.70. If an investor was to purchase shares of EBAY stock at the current price level of $66.81/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $67.50. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 9.56% if the stock gets called away at the June 2022 expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if EBAY shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for eBay Inc., as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing EBAY's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $67.50 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $67.50 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 48%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 8.53% boost of extra return to the investor, or 16.75% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.
The implied volatility in the put contract example is 36%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 35%.
Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 251 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $66.81) to be 33%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

2021-12-13 00:00:00+00:00,Etsy vs. eBay: Which Stock is a Better Pick?,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/etsy-vs.-ebay%3A-which-stock-is-a-better-pick,,,"Online marketplaces are witnessing a significant uptick in visitors, a trend that has been accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic. As brick-and-mortar shops remained closed, people turned to online marketplaces, where products and services are offered by third-party vendors, to fulfill their needs.
According to a Statista report, while Amazon (AMZN) and eBay (EBAY) remain the most visited online marketplaces globally, other competitors are quickly catching up.
Let us compare two such online marketplaces, Etsy and eBay, using the TipRanks stock comparison tool and see what Wall Street analysts are saying about these stocks.
Etsy (NASDAQ: ETSY)
Shares of Etsy have seen a significant pullback as the stock has plunged 17.4% in the past month. This is even as the company is experiencing significant interest from buyers on its platform.
In Q3, the online marketplace acquired 11.1 million new and reactivated buyers. Reactivated buyers are those buyers who have not purchased from Etsy in the past year. The company stated in its press release that the number of additions of new buyers in the quarter “continues to be meaningfully elevated when compared to pre-pandemic levels.”
When it comes to revenues, Etsy posted revenues of $532.4 million in Q3, an increase of 17.9% year-over-year. However, diluted earnings came in at $0.62 per share versus $0.70 per share in the same period last year.
Guggenheim analyst Oliver Hu is also of the view that Etsy is “one of the best positioned companies this holiday” not only based on the above metric, but also based on other key strengths. Let us look at some of the key positives for the stock.
The analyst cited app usage data from Apptopia, showing that Etsy app sessions are up 54% quarter-to-date versus 50% in Q3. Hu believes that this “has positive multi-quarter implications.”
Joshua Silverman, CEO of Etsy, had commented on its Q3earnings callthat the company’s app is “the most used mobile channel for purchases on Etsy,” resulting in higher user engagement and user frequency.
Another positive for Etsy is that the company’s web traffic data is also looking up. Indeed, the TipRanks Website Traffic data supports this view. This data indicates that total unique visitors on all devices to the company's website year-to-date are up 19.39% in comparison to the same period last year.
Even analyst Hu added that there are strong indications that the website experience is improving, as after actively tracking “several website KPIs [key performance indicators],"" he sees ""declines in bounce rates [% of traffic that leaves after one page], tying in with a number of initiatives to improve content and the overall consumer experience.”
The analyst also pointed out that Etsy’s product supply is steadily increasing. By his estimate, there are currently 98.5 million items for sale, up 15% year-over-year.
Hu added, “Etsy remains a significant outlier within the consumer space, as it's been able to retain its pandemic gains and deliver growth on top of record levels, resulting in sustained triple-digit underlying growth.”
Moreover, the analyst believes that the recent fall in Etsy’s stock price could result in a buying opportunity for the stock. His “positive view centers more on the sustainability of momentum, with ample room for buyer growth and wallet share gains ahead.”
Hu is upbeat about the stock, with a Buy rating and a price target of $330 (46.5% upside) on the stock.
Other Wall Street analysts are cautiously optimistic about Etsy with a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 11 Buys, 2 Holds, and 1 Sell. The average Etsy price target of $274.54 implies 21.8% upside potential to current levels.
eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY)
eBay is currently going through a transition period, as it has sold several business segments over the past two years, including StubHub, Classifieds, and EBAY Korea. The company has made it clear that it intends to concentrate more on its Marketplace platform.
Guggenheim analyst Oliver Hu is “positive” about the strategic direction that the company has taken, and also about its management team, as they have simplified the business portfolio “and increased their focus on enhancing the experience across category verticals, driving higher value buyers, and creating new profit streams.”
But the analyst also pointed out that there is near-term pressure on the company’s growth, as indicated by its recent Q3 results. In Q3, eBay’s Gross Merchandize Volume (GMV) slid 10% year-over-year to $19.5 billion, while annual active buyers also fell 5% year-over-year to a total of 154 million.
However, Hu added that some of this decline was intentional, as eBay concentrated on higher value buyers, and “it may take a few more quarters to get comfortable with that vs. attrition from peak pandemic demand.”
While the analyst remained encouraged with the traction across a number of categories on eBay, including watches, sneakers, and collectibles, a key concern remained. This was, according to Hu, that eBay still lagged other online marketplaces when it comes to website traffic.
The analyst analyzed average monthly traffic for 12 marketplaces that indicated that page views have climbed on an average of 90% since 2018 for these 12 marketplaces. When including Etsy, there is a rise of 100%.  
In contrast, Hu mentioned that these page views have declined for eBay over that same time period. These metrics indicate that competitive dynamics are “elevated” for the company, the analyst concluded.
This is also borne out by analyzing the website traffic data using the TipRanks website traffic tool. This data, provided by SEMRush Holdings (SEMR), indicates that total estimated visits to the eBay site on all devices year-to-date are up only 0.24% from the same period last year.
Lastly, Hu added, “The stock may trade sideways for now, against difficult comparisons and as other parts of retail recover. We would expect to get a clearer view of eBay’s true run -rate over the next 6 -9 months, with the upcoming analyst day an important potential catalyst to lay a framework for long-term growth.”
As a result, the analyst was sidelined on the stock with a Hold rating and a price target of $80 with a 19.6% upside.
Rest of the Street is cautiously optimistic, with a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 7 Buys and 11 Holds. The average eBay price target of $78.59 implies 17.5% upside potential to current levels.
Bottom Line
It is important here to note that there is a difference between the kind of online marketplace that these companies aim to be. While eBay is concentrating more on its Managed Payments and advertising business when it comes to its marketplace, Etsy is looking at attracting potential buyers looking for niche everyday items or those for “special purchase” occasions.
While analysts are cautiously optimistic about both stocks, based on the upside potential over the next 12 months, Etsy seems to be a better buy.

See the 10 stocks
*Stock Advisor returns as of November 10, 2021
Rachel Warren: PayPal announced on Monday that it would be partnering with Amazon to allow customers to pay on Amazon.com and the Amazon mobile app using Venmo as of 2022. In the press release announcing the partnership, PayPal said that a recent Venmo behavior study revealed that 65% of Venmo users said they increased their online purchasing behaviors amid the pandemic and 47% are interested in paying with Venmo when checking out with merchants. This sounds like a fantastic partnership. CNBC reported on Tuesday though that PayPal was having its worst trading day in 20 months with shares dropping around 12% that day.
Now to be fair this seems to be less due to the partnership announced between Amazon and PayPal, and more to do with PayPal's recently released third-quarter earnings, which fell noticeably below Wall Street estimates.
Here's my question. What do you guys think about this deal? Both PayPal and Amazon recently released mixed quarterly earnings reports. Do you think PayPal or Amazon is a better stock to buy after this news? Connor, why don't you take this one first?
Connor Allen: Yes. I got to say, I'm extremely excited for PayPal, and PayPal's the company out of this deal or this partnership that I'm really excited about. I know Amazon could benefit as well. There's been some studies about people that actually wouldn't purchase something if PayPal wasn't offered.
If it's not offered in that purchase or something like that, they may not actually buy it. But I think overall this is going to be bigger news for PayPal than it is Amazon. I believe their contractual agreement with eBay just ended recently, which is what allowed them to do this partnership along with a bunch of other partnerships that they're doing. Another one is United Airlines.
They're actually allowed to do in-flight purchases using PayPal or using Venmo on United Airlines flight. So that's super cool and I think there's a lot of opportunity for PayPal in the future.
About PayPal's quarter that everyone freaked out about, I think that they had a good quarter. I think they underestimated the impact of eBay moving away from PayPal a little bit, and that's what their management said. Obviously they missed on revenue by a slight margin and that caused their stock price to drop at 12%.
But it's something that I saw Jason Moser for those who don't know, he tweeted yesterday and he said that, ""This is a business that will have $1.2 trillion of transaction volume next year.""
You're looking at a company that's obviously a huge player in the fintech industry. I think it is the player in the fintech industry personally. All that transaction volume along with monetizing Venmo is going to be huge for this business.
I think what I like to say is that PayPal fell victim to this theme of earnings season, which is what I like to call overreaction. It seems like there is a lot of overreaction going on this earnings season.
Rachel Warren: Yeah absolutely. What about you Taylor, what do you think? Oh, Taylor, I think you're muted.
Taylor Carmichael: Did it again. I do it every time.
Rachel Warren: All good, no worries.
Taylor Carmichael: I think Connor's right. I think he's totally right. It was an overreaction. I don't know why people are surprised. I expected bad numbers from PayPal because Square had bad numbers and so much of PayPal's revenues now are coming from crypto trading. Crypto trading has been big for them, it was big in the fourth quarter, big in the first quarter, bigger in the second quarter, and we knew it was down in the third quarter.
I wasn't surprised at all. I was expecting it really, but I guess the market was just some people are, watch the quarter and buy and sell. I never do that. I look at the business not so much what happens on the quarter.

2021-12-09 00:00:00+00:00,Interesting EBAY Put And Call Options For January 2022,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/interesting-ebay-put-and-call-options-for-january-2022,,,"Investors in eBay Inc. (Symbol: EBAY) saw new options become available today, for the January 2022 expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the EBAY options chain for the new January 2022 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $67.00 strike price has a current bid of $2.25. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $67.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $64.75 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of EBAY, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $67.42/share today.
Because the $67.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 3.36% return on the cash commitment, or 24.51% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for eBay Inc., and highlighting in green where the $67.00 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $68.00 strike price has a current bid of 86 cents. If an investor was to purchase shares of EBAY stock at the current price level of $67.42/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $68.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 2.14% if the stock gets called away at the January 2022 expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if EBAY shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for eBay Inc., as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing EBAY's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $68.00 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $68.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 1.28% boost of extra return to the investor, or 9.31% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.
Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $67.42) to be 34%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

2021-12-09 00:00:00+00:00,3 Stocks to Add to Your Portfolio in a Market Pullback,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-stocks-to-add-to-your-portfolio-in-a-market-pullback,,,"Over long periods (like decades), the stock market has always gone up. It hasn't done so in a straight line, though, as it has pulled back to a small or great degree every few years. All investors need to expect that there will be occasional stock market corrections and crashes -- which can last a few months or a few years. That's why you should never invest in stocks with short-term money.
It's worth keeping some cash on hand for such downturns, as many great stocks will be on offer at discounted prices. Here are three stocks you might consider adding to your portfolio when there's a market pullback.
Image source: Getty Images.
1. PayPal
PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL) is more than you probably think it is. Yes, it's the online payment platform spun off by eBay in 2015. But it has grown into a fintech giant -- recently sporting a market value near $217 billion -- and now encompasses brands such as Venmo, Xoom, Honey, Paidy, Happy Returns, Hyperwallet, and more.
PayPal recently sported 416 active consumer and merchant accounts, employed 27,700 workers, and processed nearly 37,000 payment transactions per minute -- for a total volume of about $1.2 trillion over a year.
With a recent price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio near 44 and a price-to-sales ratio near 9, the stock doesn't look cheap, though it's more reasonably priced than many popular growth stocks these days. Regardless, a pullback in price will be welcome for investors who see PayPal as having a very promising future.
2. Waste Management
Waste Management (NYSE: WM) has long tempted many investors -- while often seeming too richly valued. Meanwhile, though, over the past 10 years, the stock has surged some 572% (an annualized rate of 21%), assuming dividends were reinvested, and 472% without reinvesting dividends (which is 19%, annualized). Clearly, there's money in garbage.
Waste Management is North America's premier trash collection and recycling business, offering everything from collection, transfer, and disposal services, to recycling and resource recovery. The company also owns and operates multiple landfill gas-to-energy facilities, making lots of lemonade from lemons. One of the great things about the company is its defensiveness. We're not likely to stop needing garbage and recycling services anytime soon, so its future seems assured.
With a recent P/E ratio near 40, Waste Management's stock seems pricey, but a stock market pullback will render its shares more attractive.
3. Roku
Roku (NASDAQ: ROKU) has grown rapidly into a streaming giant, going from being mostly a hardware specialist to now offering lots of content, including original content. As of 2021's third quarter, the company boasted 56 million active accounts (up 23% year over year), 18 billion hours of streaming (up 21%), and $680 million in quarterly net revenue (up 51%). Management noted:
While the pandemic has had different impacts on different parts of our business, the secular shift to streaming remains intact. Our Q4 outlook is for strong growth with total net revenue of $893 million at the midpoint (up 37% year-over-year), and total gross profit of $385 million at the midpoint (up 26% year-over-year).
In a little over four years, Roku's stock has surged close to 800%, averaging annual growth of close to 70%. The stock is down 57% from its 52-week high as of this writing, but it still recently sported a price-to-sales ratio of 11 and a P/E ratio of 98, suggesting it's not exactly inexpensively priced yet. Still, some see the stock as a screaming buy. If you agree, consider buying some shares now -- or, better still, waiting for a market pullback.
These are just a few of many great companies you might consider for your long-term portfolio. If any interest you, dig deeper into them to see if what they offer is what you're looking for.

2021-12-03 00:00:00+00:00,Why Investors Should Not Ignore PayPal's Advantages Amid Square's Competitive Moves,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-investors-should-not-ignore-paypals-advantages-amid-squares-competitive-moves,,,"PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL) pioneered the fintech industry in many respects when it facilitated payments via email in the 1990s. However, Square (NYSE: SQ) emerged as an increasingly visible competitor after introducing its smartphone credit card reader and steadily expanding its ecosystem.
But, amid this rivalry, investors may not notice that PayPal has taken more of a consumer focus than its peer. Through an emphasis on that target market, the fintech stock has become well-positioned to continue to drive long-term stock gains.
Image source: Getty Images.
How Square and PayPal compete
Investors tend to assume that Square directly competes with PayPal. Although Square designed a more business-oriented ecosystem than PayPal, that assertion is undoubtedly true when it comes to social-payment platforms. Venmo (owned by PayPal) and Cash App (owned by Square) remain locked in a competitive battle for market supremacy. Cash App recently claimed 70 million users, only slightly lagging the 80 million claimed by Venmo. Cash App's usage surged quickly during its move into Bitcoin trading. This move eventually forced Venmo to offer cryptocurrency trading on its platform.
Research and Markets forecasts the fintech industry will increase at a compound annual growth rate of 27% through 2026. If this prediction proves accurate, both PayPal and Square can continue to benefit from industry expansion for years to come.
Additionally, outside of social payments, PayPal often holds the advantage on the consumer side. PayPal entered the interest-free, buy now, pay later (BNPL) market first then expanded it by $2.7 billion for Japanese BNPL company Paidy. Square responded but only by paying a much higher price, $29 billion, for Afterpay. Furthermore, PayPal's purchase of Honey brought discounts from more than 30,000 retailers to its platform. In contrast, Cash App requires the use of a company-issued debit card to earn discounts.
PayPal's financials
PayPal's approach helped it generate $18.5 billion in the first nine months of 2021. This was a 20% increase from the same period in 2020. The rising revenue helped the company earn $3.4 billion in net income in the first three quarters of 2021, 28% more than in the first nine months of 2020. Limiting the operating expense growth to 17% along with a 96% reduction in income tax expenses helped offset the approximately 80% reduction in income from non-core sources.
The company also stated on its third-quarter 2021 earnings call that it expects this pattern to continue as it forecasts 2021 revenue of approximately $25.4 billion, an 18% year-over-year increase. PayPal also predicts a 2021 earnings per share (EPS) at $4.60, 19% higher than in 2020.
This steady growth has not stopped PayPal stock from taking a bigger hit than Square over the last year. During that time, it lost 13% of its value versus just 5% for Square. This occurred as PayPal has fallen by almost 60% from its 52-week high. Despite that drop, PayPal has risen by more than 400% since the spinoff from eBay returned it to the public markets in 2015.
Moreover, while Square has become risky at around 180 times earnings, PayPal trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 45. PayPal also maintains a lower sales multiple, selling for seven times sales versus nine for Square. That price-to-sales (P/S) ratio does not account for the fact that 60% of Square's revenue in the first nine months of fiscal 2021 was Bitcoin payment volume. Without the payment volume, Square would trade at a substantially higher sales multiple, making PayPal a significantly more affordable stock.
The PayPal edge
PayPal's different take on fintech provides an opportunity to investors. Even between the competition in social payments and business customers, PayPal stands out with its fintech offerings directly for consumers, allowing it to take the lead in specific fintech segments.
Lastly, PayPal has grown rapidly since it returned to the public markets, offering rising profits with a relatively low multiple. Given this valuation and its competitive advantages, PayPal should continue to play a key role in this burgeoning industry.

The put contract at the $65.00 strike price has a current bid of $4.60. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $65.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $60.40 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of EBAY, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $67.02/share today.
Because the $65.00 strike represents an approximate 3% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 60%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 7.08% return on the cash commitment, or 19.43% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for eBay Inc., and highlighting in green where the $65.00 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $67.50 strike price has a current bid of $5.15. If an investor was to purchase shares of EBAY stock at the current price level of $67.02/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $67.50. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 8.40% if the stock gets called away at the April 2022 expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if EBAY shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for eBay Inc., as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing EBAY's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $67.50 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $67.50 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 48%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 7.68% boost of extra return to the investor, or 21.10% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.
The implied volatility in the put contract example is 37%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 36%.
Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $67.02) to be 34%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

2021-12-01 00:00:00+00:00,The Implied Analyst 12-Month Target For QMJ,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/the-implied-analyst-12-month-target-for-qmj,,,"Looking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at ETF Channel, we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. For the Direxion S&P 500— High minus Low Quality ETF ETF (Symbol: QMJ), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $76.43 per unit.
With QMJ trading at a recent price near $69.18 per unit, that means that analysts see 10.47% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of QMJ's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are eBay Inc. (Symbol: EBAY), Berkley Corp (Symbol: WRB), and Lilly (Eli) & Co (Symbol: LLY). Although EBAY has traded at a recent price of $67.46/share, the average analyst target is 12.92% higher at $76.18/share. Similarly, WRB has 12.54% upside from the recent share price of $76.64 if the average analyst target price of $86.25/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting LLY to reach a target price of $278.62/share, which is 12.33% above the recent price of $248.04. Below is a twelve month price history chart comparing the stock performance of EBAY, WRB, and LLY:
Below is a summary table of the current analyst target prices discussed above:
NAME SYMBOL RECENT PRICE AVG. ANALYST 12-MO. TARGET % UPSIDE TO TARGET
Direxion S&P 500— High minus Low Quality ETF ETF QMJ $69.18 $76.43 10.47%
eBay Inc. EBAY $67.46 $76.18 12.92%
Berkley Corp WRB $76.64 $86.25 12.54%
Lilly (Eli) & Co LLY $248.04 $278.62 12.33%
Are analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past. These are questions that require further investor research.

2021-12-01 00:00:00+00:00,PayPal Stock: Multiple Levers for Growth,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/paypal-stock%3A-multiple-levers-for-growth,,,"Despite the ongoing shift towards the digital economy, 2021 has proven to be a challenging year for PayPal (PYPL).
Shares of this financial technology company are down about 21% on a year-to-date basis compared to 22.4% growth in the Nasdaq composite index. 
PayPal’s underperformance stems from tough year-over-year comparisons, eBay’s (EBAY) payment migration, and management’s cautious outlook. PayPal’s management expects tight labor market and retail supply chain disruptions to negatively impact holiday sales and its financial performance.  
Now What?
While PayPal stock underperformed the market averages this year, could 2022 change its course?
UBS analyst Rayna Kumar initiated coverage on PayPal stock with a bullish outlook. She stated that the recent selloff in PayPal stock represents an opportunity to buy. 
It’s worth noting that PayPal struck a deal with Amazon (AMZN) that would enable American consumers to shop on Amazon with PayPal’s Venmo account. In response to the deal, PayPal’s CEO, Dan Schulman, stated that Amazon’s large market share will significantly boost “the addressable market for Pay with Venmo.” 
He added that “Pay with Venmo is one of the key revenue drivers for Venmo going forward.”
Besides the Amazon deal, the acquisition of Paidy and the rapid adoption of PayPal’s BNPL (buy now pay later) offering bodes well for future growth. PayPal stated that since the launch of its BNPL offerings, it has processed $5.4 billion in TPV (total payment volume). Meanwhile, PayPal plans to expand its global pay later portfolio in the first half of 2022.
Further, PayPal stock has positive indicators from insiders and investors. TipRanks’ insider trading activity tool shows that insiders bought $2.3 million worth of its shares in the past three months. Meanwhile, about 10.5% of investors who hold portfolios on TipRanks have raised their exposure to PayPal stock in the last 30 days.
Wall Street’s Take
Wall Street analysts continue to show confidence in PayPal stock. On TipRanks, PayPal sports a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 24 Buys, 5 Holds, and 1 Sell. The average PayPal price target of $276.04 implies 49.3% upside potential to current levels.
Moreover, PayPal stock scores a “Perfect 10” on TipRanks’ Smart Score system, indicating that it could outperform market averages.

As December comes into view, should investors be watching e-commerce stocks in the stock market right now? It is safe to say the answer could be a resounding yes. While consumer spending at brick-and-mortar stores is poised to pick up through the holidays, it’s highly likely that the discovery of the new Omicron variant could make people more cautious about venturing out. And this could bode well for investors looking for top e-commerce stocks to buy.
In light of this, it appears that the near-term outlook for e-commerce sales for both discretionary items and necessities is looking more positive. Regardless of the severity of the new variant, e-commerce trends are likely here to stay. No doubt, there may be global supply chain issues that will affect the timeline of your shipment. But that doesn’t mean there’s no more opportunity in the space. For instance, online resale retailers such as The RealReal (NASDAQ: REAL) and ThredUp (NASDAQ: TDUP) bucked the trend by posting strong revenue growth in the third quarter.
In total, by 2023, the resale market is expected to reach $51 billion, according to a recent report from ThredUp. You may be unfamiliar with the two resale retailers I’ve just mentioned, but Etsy’s (NASDAQ: ETSY) significant growth during the pandemic is not something you want to miss. Many are even banking on ETSY stock given its significant potential to scale. Even though recent trends suggest that more shoppers are buying from resale retailers, traditional online retailers are not faring too bad either. With all that being said, let’s check out some of the top e-commerce stocks to watch in the stock market today.
Best E-Commerce Stocks To Watch Ahead Of December 2021
Shopify Inc. (NYSE: SHOP)
eBay Inc. (NASDAQ: EBAY)
Sea Limited (NYSE: SE)
Walmart Inc. (NYSE: WMT)
Shopify
Shopify is making waves in the e-commerce space right now. This came after the Canadian-based online shopping platform recorded over $2.9 billion in sales during Black Friday this year. This represents a 22% increase from last year at a time when many consumers were reluctant to shop in person due to coronavirus concerns.  More impressively, Shopify President Harley Finkelstein said its Shopify merchants have now surpassed last year’. For starters, Shopify offers technology that powers online stores for other businesses, and it also offers point-of-sale systems.
The company’s third fiscal quarter results showed this growth. Its revenue reached $1.1 billion, up 46% year over year. Shopify president Harley Finkelstein said merchants on the platform took 15 years to achieve $200 billion in cumulative gross merchandise value (GMV), but just 16 months to double that to $400 billion. For this latest quarter, GMV reached $42 billion for the period, up 35% from last year. With such strong results, it is safe to say that SHOP stock is one of the top e-commerce stocks to watch in the stock market.

eBay
What started as an auction site has become a thriving online marketplace. With its focus on secondhand items, eBay has become indispensable for many during the ongoing supply chain crisis. Why wait for months for a new item to ship from abroad, when you can purchase it secondhand and have it shipped within days? This shift in shopping trend is a boon for eBay, which takes a portion from every sale made on the site. The company recently launched eBay Refurbished, where shoppers can find refurbished items from popular brands such as Dyson and Samsung. The refurbished items go through a thorough vetting process that ensures every item meets the company’s high-performance standards. Not to mention, these items will also come with a one- or two-years warranty.
Besides that, it is worth noting that eBay will be acquiring Sneaker Con Digital’s authentication business. This is a leading sneaker authenticator with operations in the U.S., U.K, Canada, Australia, and Germany. Ultimately, the deal further solidifies eBay’s vertical expansion strategy in sneakers and increases the confidence of customers in the purchase of high-value items. With all these in mind, EBAY stock could be an interesting one to watch in the stock market.

Sea
While relatively unknown on these shores, Sea is no doubt a household name in Asia. The Singapore-based company owns Shopee, one of the leading e-commerce sites in Southeast Asia, and Garena, an online games developer and publisher. This year, Shopee saw over 2 billion items sold on the site over the 11.11 sales period which is one of the biggest sales periods in Asia. Earlier this year, the company also launched Shopee in Poland, France, and Spain. Safe to say, the company’s e-commerce arm is expanding globally at an incredibly fast pace.
Sea’s latest fiscal quarter results are a reflection of this. The company recorded $2.7 billion in revenue, a surge of 122% year-over-year. CFO Tony Hou credited the rise in revenue to its e-commerce business and its self-developed game, Free Fire. Sea also raised its full year revenue guidance to $5 billion to $5.2 billion, up from the previous $4.7 billion to $4.9 billion. Keeping in mind Sea’s rapid expansion, could SE stock be one of the best e-commerce stocks to buy now?

Walmart
Last but not least, we have the retail giant that needs no introduction, Walmart.  With the Omicron variant making an appearance, the multinational retail corporation could see shoppers make another beeline to its physical and online stores. Walmart also plays its part by continuing to innovate for its customers. Earlier this month, the company announced that it is acquiring “select technology assets” from Botmock. The start-up offers a set of tools for designing, prototyping, testing, and deploying conversational applications across platforms. Walmart plans to use this technology to enhance its conversational commerce services.
Walmart’s track record of keeping its customer’s satisfaction a priority would likely have a long-term positive impact. The company recorded $140.53 billion in revenue for its latest quarter, a rise of 4.3% year-over-year. On top of that, CEO Doug McMillon recently hinted that its holiday season has started on a solid note. In a meeting with President Joe Biden, McMillion said, “We think we are going to have a really good holiday season.” Considering all these, could WMT stock be worth watching right now?

2021-11-30 00:00:00+00:00,My Top 2 Growth Stocks to Buy in December,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/my-top-2-growth-stocks-to-buy-in-december,,,"With 2021 wrapping up, some investors evaluate their performance over the year. I prefer looking forward and searching for investment opportunities. Two stocks I own and will add to during December are PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ: PYPL) and MercadoLibre (NASDAQ: MELI).
The stock prices of both are down nearly 40% from all-time highs, yet their businesses are strong. Why are two high-profile names struggling lately to provide returns for investors?

1. PayPal
PayPal provides a payment platform to process consumer and business transactions. It also owns Venmo, a popular app for sending money; and Honey, the browser add-on that saves customers money through automated coupon searches. The tailwinds behind e-commerce and digital payments blew hard throughout the pandemic, and PayPal benefited significantly.
One area that bears have focused on is eBay's (NASDAQ: EBAY) transition away from PayPal. Although eBay used to own PayPal and was the sole payment processor, the agreement no longer exists. But eBay's payment volume was only 3% of PayPal's total third-quarter volume.
As for payment volume, it was up 26% to $310 billion in the third quarter, which brings PayPal's trailing-12-month volume to $1.2 trillion. Removing eBay transactions from the calculation accelerates its growth to 31%. Revenue grew 13% counting eBay-derived revenue and 25% without it. While losing a consistent revenue stream isn't a positive for PayPal, it is still executing well without it.
Replacing PayPal's eBay partnership, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) recently began accepting Venmo as a payment form on its website. This is significant, as PayPal's flagship product isn't accepted as a payment form during Amazon's checkout process. After the Venmo partnership was reached, PayPal can realize new revenue streams from Amazon, the world's largest e-commerce retailer.
PayPal was rumored to be buying Pinterest (NYSE: PINS), sending share prices tumbling 10% in late October. PayPal's stock price has not recovered even after it released an official statement noting it was not pursuing the acquisition. Its Venmo partnership with Amazon coincided with its third-quarter earnings release, but it wasn't enough to keep the market from selling off another 10%. With the stock now down more than $100 a share from its all-time high, the market seems to have forgotten PayPal's potential.
PayPal's valuation is also low, trading at a level not seen since March 2020.
PYPL P/E ratio data by YCharts.
With fourth-quarter guidance of 12% to 14% revenue growth and payment volume rising another 33%, PayPal is still a solid growth stock. Nothing in the financials suggests this stock should be down nearly 40%.
2. MercadoLibre
MercadoLibre is bringing aspects of e-commerce that U.S. consumers love to Latin America. It has PayPal's payment element, Amazon's e-commerce platform, and shipping solutions to 18 countries across North and South America. It also has a small but growing credit platform for lending to businesses and consumers.
The pandemic gave MercadoLibre a huge boost. Revenue grew year over year at more than 100% during the previous four quarters. Its third-quarter revenue overlapped these incredible results, and growth is slowing, but revenue still increased 73% in the quarter.
None of MercadoLibre's business segments are lagging; all are executing. While nowhere near PayPal's payment volume, Mercado Pago processed $20.9 billion, growing 59% on a currency-neutral basis. The logistics division, Mercado Envios, shipped 32% more packages year over year. Currency-neutral gross merchandise volume sold on its e-commerce platform rose 30% to $7.3 billion. Mercado Pago added an option to buy, sell, and hold cryptocurrencies in Brazil beginning at the end of November.
Its price-to-sales ratio is as cheap now as it was during the low point of the pandemic-driven sell-off.
MELI P/S ratio data by YCharts.
Investors should be taking advantage of MercadoLibre's depressed prices. It's not often the market holds a sale like it has now. Latin America's digital transformation is not complete, and MercadoLibre will continue being the transition's driving force.
PayPal and MercadoLibre are two growth stocks down significantly. While market price fluctuations may result in 20% swings periodically, 40% drops must be examined for business weakness or market inconsistency. I believe market inconsistency is the case for both companies, which is why their stocks are my December top buys.

2021-11-29 00:00:00+00:00,The News of Omicron is Dominating the Market: What to Do Now,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/the-news-of-omicron-is-dominating-the-market%3A-what-to-do-now,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Last Friday was a bad way to end a great holiday break. The S&P 500 tanked 2.27% on news that a discovered COVID-19 variant called Omicron could threaten the economic recovery and lead to more lockdowns and travel restrictions.
Source: Shutterstock
It will be a few weeks before we know for sure what to expect from the variant and how current vaccines will fare against the virus, which means prices are likely to remain volatile and choppy this week at a minimum.
This has already been a pretty good year for stocks, so investors taking some profits off the table would not be a surprise, and that could compound some short-term selling before Wednesday.
However, because the data we have right now is still very positive, we recommend going with the historical odds rather than running from the market.
Does a big daily loss like this tell us anything about the next 30 days? Is this a good buying opportunity or should traders hang back and wait for the market to consolidate at support? We have been studying the market for 20 years, and history can help set our expectations if we take a closer look at the numbers.
Avoid This Mistake AND Get $1,375 Instant Cash Payouts?
Over the last 12 years, there have been 107 days where the market lost more than -2%, and those losses have been followed by a positive return over the next 30-day period 75.7% of the time.
The average profit for the month following a big day to the downside is +2.918%, which may not sound like much, but helps put Friday’s market volatility in perspective.
What to Do Now
It is unlikely that Friday’s selling will be the end of any bearishness. We think that this week will continue to be choppy while traders settle down and we all wait to get a little more information about the new COVID variant.
However, later this week, we recommend looking at this pullback as a buying opportunity once prices have started to slow. A bearish market drives interest rates lower which makes this an ideal time to consider tech, real estate, and retail.
We like:
Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT): As in prior updates over the last few weeks, we still think this is a winner, and if there is to be more distance work/learning due to COVID, then demand for MSFT’s collaboration software and cloud services will remain strong.
Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE): Like MSFT, ADBE is a big player in collaboration and subscription software that will be in even more demand if traders want to hedge against business travel restrictions. Prices between $620 and $640 look like a strong buy to us.
eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY): eBay has been able to hold onto the edge it developed during the pandemic last year, and more online retail spending is only likely to send the stock higher. Any dips below $70 per share are a great buy opportunity.
Should You Buy Pandemic Stocks?
The short answer to the pandemic stocks question is: no… and yes.
When traders think about stocks that did well in the pandemic, the first names that come to mind are Zoom Video Communications Inc. (NASDAQ:ZM), Chegg Inc. (NYSE:CHGG), Peloton Interactive Inc. (NASDAQ:PTON), and similar firms.
However, these stocks were unable to hold onto their gains when travel restrictions started to ebb, and the stocks tanked. For example, ZM is down 60% from its pandemic highs, and big institutional investors are unlikely to want to jump right back into the big names from the pandemic.
Still get trading ideas from Reddit? There’s a much better way…
For now, we recommend steering clear of the ZM, CHGG, PTON, Roku Inc. (NASDAQ:ROKU), and Logitech International S.A. (NASDAQ:LOGI) crowd. Any gains in that group are likely to evaporate quickly if the variant news is less bad than expected.
However, stocks like Microsoft, Adobe, eBay, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), have done very well defending their gains from the pandemic and will attract the big investors who want to hedge against risks again this time.
We also recommend adding to your list a few retail firms that never gained a rep for being a “pandemic stock” but were able to leverage and hold their position over the last two years to grab more market share. In addition to eBay and Amazon, we would include Target Corp. (NYSE:TGT) and Best Buy (NYSE:BBY) on that list.
From a pandemic/retail perspective, BBY is risky, but we think they may also offer the best short-term returns of the bunch. BBY reported earnings earlier last week and tanked despite crushing estimates because costs are rising, however, online sales are higher margin, and management is responding well to improving in-store sales.
What Else is Coming?
News about the pandemic will likely dominate the market all week, however, there are a few highlights to look out for.
The monthly labor report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) is due on Friday, and it will be a market mover. When we compare the official reports (full of guestimates) over the last few months with the data being reported during earnings season, we still feel that the BLS has been undercounting jobs and could make a big correction this month.
The BLS does its best to reconcile the data gathered through surveys with seasonality adjustments and their own best estimates of hiring. However, over- or under-counting can happen when there are so many unique factors. In our view, a surprise to the upside seems very likely, which could come at the perfect time to push the market higher on Friday.
Final Thoughts
If you thought Friday’s selling was bad for stocks, just look at oil prices. WTI Crude dropped 13% on Friday, bringing it down to the prices we went on record saying were inflated back in September. It seems likely that OPEC will try to boost prices by reducing supply, but pandemic fears will probably overwhelm anything the big producers try to do in the short term.
For now, we recommend staying clear of energy stocks. However, if worries about the new variant fade quickly, there could be some discounted stocks in the group. But that is a conversation for when prices start to settle down.
Sincerely,
John Jagerson & Wade Hansen

2021-11-27 00:00:00+00:00,3 Leading Software-as-a-Service Stocks to Buy in 2021 and Beyond,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-leading-software-as-a-service-stocks-to-buy-in-2021-and-beyond,,,"Software-as-a-service (SaaS) stocks can be quite lucrative investments. The business model is subscription-based, which keeps customers paying monthly fees. Because the software often becomes integral to the operations of organizations that use it, customers are likely to stick with the providers they sign with, and expand their business with them over time. Also, software has minimal costs for physical production and distribution, allowing these companies to operate with high gross margins.
Three top SaaS stocks that investors should consider today are Shopify (NYSE: SHOP), Procore (NYSE: PCOR), and Twilio (NYSE: TWLO).
Image source: Getty Images.
Shopify
This Canadian e-commerce giant provides businesses with an online presence. With options well-priced for businesses of any size, Shopify provides even the humblest start-ups with an affordable way to reach customers across the internet. It also provides marketing and payment processing tools.
According to eMarketer, Shopify's platform facilitated the second-largest share of U.S. e-commerce sales last year -- behind only Amazon, and ahead of even huge retailers like Walmart or marketplace operators like eBay.
While it's still far behind Amazon in terms of market share, during the third quarter, Shopify grew its revenue by 46% as its gross merchandise volume (GMV) grew by 35% to $41.8 billion. Additionally, it has more than $7.5 billion of cash on its balance sheet -- money it can put to work growing its operations.
Shopify has been a remarkable stock over the last five years, up over 3,500%. Yet, management expects its GMV to increase faster than commerce Q4 commerce in general. It also has long-term goals to create a fulfillment network and develop a business-to-business platform. With ambitious expansion plans and growth ahead, every growth investor should consider owning Shopify.
Procore
Procore's SaaS offering targets the construction industry. It allows owners, contractors, and sub-contractors to connect with each other and gather all the information about a project in a single location. Construction is one of the last industries to join the SaaS revolution and Procore is leading the way.
Its revenue grew at a solid 30% rate in Q3 to $132 million, and it produced free cash flow of $6.5 million. Unlike many SaaS companies, Procore is not putting its focus on expanding as quickly as possible. Instead, it lets customers find its platform organically. It does this by letting paying customers add non-paying users to a project. After those businesses realize the benefits of managing projects with Procore, they are more likely to join up and become paying customers.
Procore is at a much earlier stage of its growth than Shopify; it believes it has captured 2% of its potential customers, and less than half of its current customers subscribe to four or more of its 13 products. Its worldwide expansion is progressing; Procore will begin operating in France and Germany next year, for example.
Autodesk (NASDAQ: ADSK) competes against Procore with its Construction Cloud product. However, Procore expects global construction spending to reach $14 trillion in 2025. As such, the construction management software space has plenty of room for multiple players. If it can channel even 5% of spending through its platform, Procore will be a successful investment.
With a large growth runway ahead, Procore is a great SaaS stock for the future.
Twilio
If you've ever communicated with a business through text messages, chances are Twilio assisted with that. It provides application programming interfaces (APIs) so businesses can build communication tools without needing their own software engineers. It features a usage-based pricing model that generates more revenue for Twilio as its customers grow.
Twilio is growing the fastest of these three companies, with Q3 revenue up 65% year over year. It also has an impressive revenue net expansion rate of 131%, meaning existing customers spent 31% more in the quarter than in the prior-year period. And while some of Twilio's growth did come via acquiring companies, its organic growth rate sits at a still-impressive 38%. Concentration risk is being reduced as only 11% of total revenue is attributed to its top 10 accounts down from 14% during Q3 last year.
Businesses' desire and need to communicate with customers will only increase, and Twilio is making that easier for them. Management is committed to achieving organic growth of 30% or more annually over the next three years, which would increase its revenue to more than $5.5 billion using Q3 trailing-twelve-month revenue.
Twilio shows no signs of slowing down and investors should take note.
With all three of these stocks, valuation is a concern. While Twilio and Procore stock's price-to-sales ratio has recently come down, Shopify's has remained fairly steady. Shopify is also valued higher than the other two because the market believes its e-commerce opportunity is massive. Even at these levels, valuation still represents a potential investment risk. However, each deserves a high multiple because of strong execution and future expectations. Should one of the companies begin failing, the valuation will fall to reflect forward sentiment. Exciting growth prospects often come with valuation risks, and it's up to the companies to fulfill their long-term promise.
SHOP PS Ratio data by YCharts
As the world becomes more connected, SaaS offerings provide businesses with powerful tools they can use to increase their effectiveness and productivity. Wise investors should consider purchasing all three of these stocks but must beware of the risks. Holding onto these stocks looks like a great way to beat the market over the long term.

It’s going to be a record holiday shopping season like none before it.

That’s the message being passed on to us from every major retail analytics firm in the world. The National Retail Federation, for example, is predicting that retail sales will rise about 10% year-over-year this holiday season – versus an average gain of about 4% over the past five years.
Adobe is calling for a 10% rise in e-commerce sales this holiday season to a new record – an impressive rise considering last year’s 33% surge.
Klarna’s 2021 holiday shopping survey found that more than a third of shoppers expect to spend more on gifts in 2021 than in 2020, while a Deloitte report found that holiday sales will rise a very impressive 8% this year, paced by particularly high spending among younger generations.
The big picture? It’s going to be a big holiday shopping season.
Pent-up demand is real. Interest rates are low. Savings rates are up. Consumer confidence is strong. You have exactly what you need for a surge in holiday spending.
So, as investors, we must ask the question: How do we play this surge? What are the top retail stocks to buy this holiday season?
At the top of my list are resale platforms, because of this little thing you’ve probably heard of called “supply chain challenges.” Ring a bell? Pretty much every retailer is talking about supply chain challenges these days. Well, it’s more than just talk. The prevalence of out-of-stock messages has risen a whopping 172% going into the holiday season, according to Adobe.
I don’t know about you, but I hate getting out-of-stock messages. So do most consumers.
That’s why most consumers this holiday season are going to shift to shopping platforms where such messages don’t exist: Resale platforms, like Etsy (NASDAQ:ETSY), Poshmark (NASDAQ:POSH), ThredUp (NASDAQ:TDUP), The RealReal (NASDAQ:REAL), and eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY). Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) and BigCommerce (NASDAQ:BIGC) could win big here, too, as they presumably power some resale platforms.
So, that’s the first big trend I’m focused on this holiday season. Resale. Resale. Resale.
The second is social shopping. Multiple surveys suggest that younger generations are poised to spend big this holiday season, maybe because they saved a ton of money during Covid by living at their parents, and/or because they made a ton of money by betting it all on Ethereum.
Either way, young people are going to spend a lot of money this holiday season.
Now, it’s very well-documented that these young folks like to shop online, and in particular, like to shop through social media channels. It looks like this holiday season will only accentuate that preference, as a McKinsey survey found that 87% of Gen Z shoppers will use social media for holiday shopping inspiration this year.
That’s why I’m bullish on social shopping platforms this holiday season – platforms like Snap (NYSE:SNAP), Pinterest (NYSE:PINS), Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), and Meta (NASDAQ:FB).
A third big retail trend to watch this holiday shopping is the metaverse. Some of the top toys this holiday season include AR-enhanced toys like the Tamagotchi Pix and Got2Glow Fairy Finder. Meanwhile, VR headsets have been so popular that they’re basically sold out everywhere now.
So, if you’re a big believer in the metaverse, now may be as good a time as any to buy Roblox (NASDAQ:RBLX) – since we see adoption and usage of the Roblox platform soaring this holiday season as general consumer awareness of the metaverse rises.
The fourth big retail trend I’m watching is the explosion of Buy Now, Pay Later services. These services have seen their usage soar in 2022, and most surveys indicate this surge will persist into the holiday season. One survey from PYMNTS, for example, found that BNPL usage is expected to nearly double this holiday season.
Some strong picks in the BNPL space include Affirm (NASDAQ:AFRM), PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL), and Square (NASDAQ:SQ) – the last of which looks really attractive at current levels.
Other, smaller retail trends I’m following this holiday season include a surge in TV buying thanks to some pretty big price cuts over at Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU), the launch of the Switch OLED from Nintendo (OTCMKTS:NTDOY), the continued red-hot popularity of AirPods from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and a renewed interest in buying experiences-as-a-gift in what could be a big tailwind for Live Nation (NYSE:LYV) and Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE).
Now, let’s be clear on something: We think these 20 retail stocks represent good investment opportunities – but not the best investment opportunities.
That’s because the best investment opportunities don’t emerge out of a holiday shopping trend that may come and go; rather, they emerge out of a world-changing technological innovation that will evolve over the next several years, impact people’s personal and professional lives, and ultimately create a ton of economic value for shareholders.
The best investment opportunities, in short, are in early-stage tech disruptors.
Like this tiny, $3 stock that is behind what I believe to be the biggest technological breakthrough of our lifetimes: The creation of a forever battery that will allow EVs to drive for thousands of miles, your phone to hold a charge for weeks, and your home to run exclusively on clean energy.
It’s a technological breakthrough like no other – and an investment opportunity that could mint millionaires.
So, buy yourself a gift this holiday season, and for just $3, potentially buy yourself a ticket to financial independence.

2021-11-25 00:00:00+00:00,UK software firm Blue Prism agrees to Vista's $1.63 bln final takeover offer,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/uk-software-firm-blue-prism-agrees-to-vistas-%241.63-bln-final-takeover-offer,,,"Adds details of deal, background
Nov 25 (Reuters) - British robotics software company Blue Prism PRSMB.L has agreed to a 1.22 billion pound ($1.63 billion) final takeover offer from U.S. private equity firm Vista Equity, the parties said on Thursday, topping a proposal from SS&C Technologies SSNC.O.
The increased 1,250 pence-per-share cash offer from Bali Bidco Ltd, a firm indirectly owned by Vista, comes amid objections from activist investor Coast Capital, which has supported U.S.-based SS&C's proposal.
Bali Bidco said it will fund the deal through existing cash resources.
Blue Prism directors have unanimously recommended shareholders to vote in favour of the Vista deal at meetings scheduled for Dec. 9.
SS&C last week made a 1.16 billion pound takeover approach to the British software firm.
Blue Prism, which counts automaker Daimler DAIGn.DE, eBay EBAY.O and Britain's National Health Service among its customers, initially agreed to be taken over by Vista in September for 1.09 billion pounds.
U.S.-based Coast Capital, which holds a stake of around 2.8% in Blue Prism, objected to Vista's proposal, saying the sale process was flawed. Blue Prism defended the deal, saying it was better than continuing as a standalone firm.
Shares of Blue Prism ended about 0.6% higher at 1,215 pence on Thursday, before Vista's revised offer was made after the market close.
