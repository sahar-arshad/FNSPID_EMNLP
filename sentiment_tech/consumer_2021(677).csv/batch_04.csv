2021-09-30 00:00:00+00:00,Best Retail Stocks To Buy Now? 4 To Know In October 2021,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/best-retail-stocks-to-buy-now-4-to-know-in-october-2021-2021-09-30,,,"4 Top Retail Stocks To Watch Ahead Of October 2021
As we head into the final trading day of September, retail stocks appear to be kicking into high gear. Because of this, retail stocks could be among the most active stocks in the stock market today. Despite concerns over global supply chain woes, retailers are hard at work expanding and refining their offerings. After all, the holiday season is fast approaching and supplies, as mentioned earlier, are on the low end now. The question now is whether or not this tailwind would be enough to get investors’ attention.
Regardless, there is no shortage of action in the retail space now. Just yesterday, retail giant Target (NYSE: TGT) announced its latest offering for this year-end. Namely, customers who make purchases between October 10 and December 24 are eligible for price adjustments. In essence, Target will match its prices to its competitors within two weeks of a particular purchase. Safe to say, this would make for an enticing offer to consumers looking to get their holiday shopping done now.
At the same time, new players continue to emerge in the industry as well. As of yesterday, online eyewear retailer Warby Parker (NYSE: WRBY) is now trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The company’s shares soared by over 30% on its public debut. Given all the focus on retail stocks, here are four to know in the stock market now.

Michael Witynski, President and Chief Executive Officer, stated, “For decades, our customers have enjoyed the ‘thrill-of-the-hunt’ for value at one dollar – and we remain committed to that core proposition – but many are telling us that they also want a broader product assortment when they come to shop. We believe testing additional price points above $1 for Dollar Tree products will enable us over time to expand our assortments, introduce new products and meet more of our customers’ everyday needs.” With that being said, will you add DLTR stock to your portfolio?

Analysts at Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS) upgraded their rating on AN stock to the equivalent of buy and upped their price target on the stock to $116 from $70. The firm says that it is bullish on the auto retailer’s management changes. Notably, AutoNation named Mike Manley, a former Fiat Chrysler chief executive as its CEO, replacing Mike Jackson who is retiring after more than 20 years with the company. The appointment has been dubbed as a significant narrative change and Morgan Stanley’s new target reflects the potential for AutoNation to be a stronger player in the new mobility ecosystem. For these reasons, should investors consider adding AN stock to their watchlist right now?

2021-09-29 00:00:00+00:00,Can AI Beat the Market? 10 Stocks to Watch,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/can-ai-beat-the-market-10-stocks-to-watch-2021-09-29,,,"Artificial intelligence (AI) isn't new to the world of stock picking, but it hasn't really been an option for retail investors. That is, until now.
Traditionally, powerful artificial intelligence systems – and the high-octane brain power needed to develop and operate them – that target stocks to watch have been available only to institutional investors. We're talking hedge funds, quant funds and a select group of asset management firms.
Danelfin, a financial advice company formerly known as Danel Capital, is trying to change all that. 
Danelfin has developed an analytics platform that harnesses the power of big data technology and machine learning. The goal is to level the playing field by giving regular investors access to institutional-level technology that helps them make smarter decisions with their tactical stock picks.
A particularly attractive part of Danelfin's recently redesigned platform is that it's now free to use for retail investors. Premium plans unlock access to additional features. 
SEE MORE All 30 Dow Jones Stocks Ranked: The Pros Weigh In
What's going on under the hood, however, remains the same. The company's AI algorithms analyze more than 900 fundamental, technical and sentiment data points per day for 1,000 U.S.-listed shares and 600 stocks listed in Europe. Danelfin says that in total, its AI predictive scoring capability churns through 10,000 daily indicators. The platform then analyzes that ocean of inputs to predict the future performance of each stock, calculating its probability of beating the market over the next 90 market days.
Once the algo determines which stocks to watch, it spits out a rating known as an AI Score, which ranges from 1 to 10. In a backtest run from January 2017 through March 2021, U.S.-listed stocks with perfect 10 AI Scores generated average yearly returns of 35.2%, while stocks with the lowest AI Scores of 1 generated average yearly returns of 11.8%.
A more recent test was likewise encouraging. Danelfin's top 10 U.S. stock picks as of June 23 delivered an average return of 4.4% through Sept. 28. That beat the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY, $433.72) by nearly 2 percentage points.
Here are 10 stocks to watch with perfect 10 AI Scores as of Sept. 25. For good measure, we also took a look at what Wall Street analysts had to say about these names.
And remember: We're talking about the probability of a stock beating the market over the next few months or so, not days, and not years. That means the platform is moreso pointing out the best stocks to buy for tactical investors, but not necessarily day traders nor long-term investors.

Share prices and other data are courtesy of S&P Global Market Intelligence as of Sept. 28, unless otherwise noted. The AI Score comprises three subcategories for fundamentals, technicals and sentiment, but it is not an average of those other scores; rather, it is a predictive score based on all the data available for a stock. AI Scores are as of Sept. 25.

10. Dollar Tree
Market value: $19.4 billion
Fundamental score: 8
Technical score: 7
Sentiment score: 7
Shares in Dollar Tree (DLTR, $86.28) are off by roughly a fifth for the year-to-date, trailing the broader market by close to a whopping 40 percentage points. But if the signals picked up by Danelfin's AI algorithms are correct, this could be a good time for tactical investors to pick up DLTR on the cheap.
As with all the stocks to watch on this list, DLTR gets a perfect AI Score of 10, suggesting it is poised for outperformance over the next 90 market days. Importantly, the stock has maintained that top AI rating on a weekly basis since Aug. 30.
Where the low-cost retail chain stands out is in its fundamental score of 8 – a level it hasn't fallen below on a weekly basis since June 28. The stock's technical score, meanwhile, has been in an uptrend since Aug. 23, as has its score for sentiment.
The Street skews bullish on DLTR, giving it a consensus recommendation of Buy, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. However, the market is down on the stock – and some analysts remain cautious on the name in the near term – because of supply-chain headaches and labor shortages.
""All-in, while we see the long-term potential, the near-term operating environment still appears very challenging in our view, with meaningful labor and transportation inflation,"" writes Raymond James analyst Bobby Griffin, who rates shares at Market Perform (the equivalent of Hold). 
Of the 27 analysts covering DLTR tracked by S&P Global Market Intelligence, seven rate it at Strong Buy, two say Buy, 17 have it at Hold and one says Sell.

9. PulteGroup
Market value: $12.2 billion
Fundamental score: 8
Technical score: 8
Sentiment score: 8
Homebuilder PulteGroup (PHM, $47.19) stock has lost about 14% over the past month, hurt by an industry-wide moderation in consumer demand from unprecedented levels. Analysts note that sticker shock – national home prices jumped a record 19.7% year-over-year in July – and a return of seasonality is no doubt playing a role. 
But a perfect 10 AI Score makes PHM poised for a rebound over the next few months, per Danelfin's AI algos. 
The stock's fundamental score of 8 – which it has maintained for seven of the past eight weeks – is driven by some attractive valuation metrics, long-term assets and gross profit, among other factors. PHM's technical score has hit 7 in three of the past four weeks, and the sentiment reading of 8 has been steady for four straight weeks, having bounced up from 5 at the end of August.
The Street is likewise bullish, giving PHM a consensus recommendation of Buy, per S&P Global Market Intelligence. Five analysts rate the stock at Strong Buy, three say Buy and seven call it a Hold. 
Raymond James analyst Buck Horne counts himself among the analysts in the bulls' camp. 
""We continue to find the risk/reward equation extremely asymmetric for this exceptionally capital efficient homebuilder,"" writes Horne, who rates shares at Strong Buy.
As much as Danelfin likes PHM stock for short-term outperformance, the Street's assessment of the homebuilder's long-term growth prospects is even more encouraging. Analysts expect the company to generate average annual earnings per share growth of 35% over the next three to five years, per S&P Global Market Intelligence.

8. Lear Corp.
Market value: $9.6 billion
Fundamental score: 8
Technical score: 9
Sentiment score: 7
Lear Corp. (LEA, $159.86) stock has lost more than a fifth of its value since peaking on June 3, leaving it just barely positive for the year-to-date. 
It's not hard to understand the market's reasons for turning on the name. As CFRA Research analyst Garrett Nelson says, ""LEA is just the latest auto supplier to lower full-year guidance, which reflects the impact of semiconductor and parts shortages that continue to impact industry volumes and higher commodity costs.""
Lear, which specializes in automotive electrical systems and seating, now assumes global auto production will increase 6% year-over-year, down from a prior assumption of 9%, adds Nelson, who rates the stock at Hold.
The Street's consensus recommendation comes to Buy, albeit with fairly low conviction. Of the 20 analysts covering LEA, five say Strong Buy, five rate it at Buy, nine call it a Hold and one says Sell. 
The view of where LEA is headed in the shorter term, however, is far more bullish, per Danelfin's AI assessment. 
Lear's perfect 10 AI Score is led by a technical grade of 9 and a fundamental score of 8, putting it firmly on the radar of stocks to watch over the next few months. As for the technical metric, LEA scored a perfect 10 as recently as Aug. 30 and has never fallen below 8 since then. The fundamental reading has remained unchanged for seven of the past eight weeks, bolstered by strong metrics for quarter-over-quarter sales growth and valuation. 
Perhaps most promising is sentiment, which has earned positive grades for two consecutive weeks after spending most of the summer stuck in neutral territory.

7. Gap
Market value: $9.3 billion
Fundamental score: 8
Technical score: 7
Sentiment score: 8
Gap (GPS, $24.60) stock had a hot first half thanks to its standing as a recovery play, but once the Delta variant reignited anxieties about mall-based retailers, the fun was over.
True, GPS is still outpacing the broader market by about 5 percentage points for the year-to-date, but that's after losing about a third of its value from its May peak.
Happily for shareholders, Danelfin's AI says the bleeding stops here, with Gap on the platform's stocks to watch. 
GPS' perfect 10 AI Score is led by fundamental and sentiment grades of 8. The fundamental reading has been in a slow weekly uptrend since mid-July, when it bottomed out a neutral level of 5. The sentiment score has remained steady at 8 for three consecutive weeks. And the technical grade has maintained its current level of 7 for four straight weeks. That's a vast improvement from where the technicals stood in early August, when they dipped into negative territory.
The Street has become incrementally more bullish on GPS over the past couple of months, as well. Analysts' consensus recommendation stands at Hold, but some pros are increasingly optimistic about the company's prospects. In addition to its namesake stores, Gap also operates the Banana Republic, Old Navy and Athleta apparel chains. 
""We are encouraged by current momentum across much of the portfolio and believe a mix shift to OldNavy/Athleta should improve margins long term,"" writes Jefferies analyst Janine Stichter (Hold). 
Interestingly, while the Street's Hold recommendation suggests GPS stock will only match the performance of the S&P 500 over the next 12 months, analysts' average target price of $33.74 gives shares implied upside of 37% from current levels. 
Meanwhile, Danelfin's algos predict GPS to beat the market over the next 90 trading days.

6. KAR Auction Services
Market value: $1.9 billion
Fundamental score: 7
Technical score: 7
Sentiment score: 10
The global chip shortage is curtailing the production of new cars, and that's had a knock-on effect at KAR Auction Services (KAR, $16.01).
KAR, you see, provides auction services for used cars, and a lack of new vehicle supply has driven used vehicle prices higher. In turn, that has ""dramatically reduced the number of off-lease vehicles reaching KAR platforms,"" notes Baird analyst Craig Kennison.
As a result, shares in KAR are down 14% so far this year. Kennison thinks it's time to pounce, rating the stock at Outperform (the equivalent of Buy). Danelfin, albeit for more quantitative reasons, wholeheartedly agrees with the analyst's call – featuring KAR Auction Services as one of its top stocks to watch.
KAR's perfect 10 AI Score is led by a sentiment grade of 10. Data points boosting that sentiment reading include valuation, relatively high short interest – or the percentage of shares outstanding sold short – and KAR's implied upside to the Street's average 12-month price target.
Meanwhile, the stock's fundamental score hasn't dropped below 7 since the end of 2020, and the technical grade has scored at 7 or higher since early May. 
While Danelfin's AI likes KAR stock for outperformance over the next few months, the Street is bullish for the long term too, giving shares a consensus recommendation of Buy. 
BofA Securities (Buy) notes the U.S. vehicle population ""aged 10 years old and younger should grow at a faster rate than the 11-plus year-old vehicle population until about 2024, when their growth rates converge."" This should benefit KAR, as well as other service providers in the automotive value chain, the analysts write.

5. Foot Locker
Market value: $5.1 billion
Fundamental score: 10
Technical score: 7
Sentiment score: 8
Foot Locker (FL, $49.31) stock shares a similar trajectory to that of GPS, above: strong first-half outperformance as a recovery play, followed by a slump on renewed COVID-19 fears.
But now a perfect fundamental score and strong marks on technical and sentiment factors should return shares in the footwear retailer back to their market-beating ways, according to Danelfin, landing it on the platform's top stocks to watch.
As for what AI says regarding the stock's three-month outlook, FL's fundamental score has been in a strong uptrend since Aug. 23. The technical grade has remained steady at 7 for four consecutive weeks, while sentiment vaulted from a low of 3 as recently as late August to hit 8 for two straight weeks. 
As encouraging as the outlook is for tactical investors, the Street is bullish on FL for longer-term investors, as well. Of the 20 analysts covering the stock tracked by S&P Global Market Intelligence, 11 rate FL at Strong Buy, three say Buy and six call it a Hold. That works out to a consensus recommendation of Buy, with fairly high conviction.
Argus Research analyst Kristina Ruggeri (Buy) cites FL having ""posted five quarters of solid earnings despite pandemic-related challenges"" among her reasons for being bullish on the stock.
""The company has benefited from strong trends in comfort and fitness apparel, pent-up demand and stimulus-driven spending,"" Ruggeri adds. ""The company is planning to launch its own brands later this year. We also have a favorable view of FL's recent acquisitions which will allow them to target new demographics and geographic regions.""

4. Herbalife
Market value: $5.1 billion
Fundamental score: 7
Technical score: 9
Sentiment score: 10
Herbalife (HLF, $43.77) was lagging the broader market for the year-to-date through Sept. 13, but at least shares were positive. An earnings warning issued after the market closed on that day took care of that, however.
The multi-level-marketing company that sells nutritional and wellness products said ""lower than expected levels of activity among its independent distributors has led to a decrease in expected third-quarter and full-year net sales.""
HLF stock plunged the following session, and is now down more than 8% in 2021.
The bright side for tactical investors is that the selloff has done wonders for Herbalife's sentiment and technical scores, per Danelfin's AI platform, setting HLF up for market-beating returns in the months ahead and making it one of the top stocks to watch. 
HLF's sentiment score stood at 8 prior to the drawdown on the earnings warning. It has marked perfect 10s ever since. The technical reading bounced even more dramatically. It was sitting at a negative grade of 4 before the bottom fell out of HLF shares. But now the grade has hit a near-perfect 9 for two consecutive weeks. Even the fundamental assessment got a mild boost, to a score of 7 from 6 prior to HLF's mid-September dive.
It certainly doesn't hurt sentiment that HLF insiders went on a buying spree after the share-price plunge.
Only four analysts cover HLF, but they are as bullish as can be. Each and every one rates the stock at Strong Buy. 
""While the earnings warning took us and investors by surprise, the positives were no remarks were made to indicate anything structurally wrong with HLF's business or model,"" writes CFRA Research analyst Arun Sundaram (Strong Buy), ""and third-quarter sales are still tracking double-digit growth versus pre-pandemic levels, indicating long-term upward momentum.""

3. Reinsurance Group of America
Market value: $7.6 billion
Fundamental score: 10
Technical score: 8
Sentiment score: 10
As one of the world's largest group life and health reinsurance companies, Reinsurance Group of America (RGA, $111.23) has taken more than its fair share of lumps from the pandemic.
RGA is negative for the year-to-date, but an improving fundamental backdrop and Danelfin's AI assessment suggest the stock is poised for outperformance as we close out 2021.
As for that fundamental backdrop, analysts note that quarterly results suggest the worst of the impact of coronavirus deaths appear to be behind the reinsurance company.
""Excess COVID mortality was down significantly quarter-over-quarter, as general population deaths declined in major markets,"" writes UBS Global Research analyst Brian Meredith (Buy). 
Moreover, the company recently lifted its suspension of share buybacks and raised its dividend, both of which are ""a strong indication of RGA's confidence despite Delta variant fears (for which cases are rising, but mortality remains low),"" the analyst adds.
Optimism like Meredith's regarding RGA is clearly showing up on Danelfin's AI radar. The stock gets perfect marks in fundamental and sentiment scores, and an 8 for technical signals. 
A favorable valuation and balance-sheet strength help bolster RGA's fundamental grade, which has notched a perfect 10 for four consecutive weeks. Sentiment has graded a perfect 10 for 12 of the past 14 weeks. Meanwhile, the technical component of Danelfin's AI Score has been in a steady uptrend since Aug. 9, when it stood at a neutral level of 5.
Despite RGA's short-term potential as one of Danelfin's stocks to watch, the Street remains split on the name longer term, giving it a consensus recommendation of Hold. Of the eight analysts covering Reinsurance Group of America tracked by S&P Global Market Intelligence, one says Strong Buy, one rates it at Buy, three call it a Hold, one says Sell and one has it at Strong Sell.

2. Unum Group
Market value: $5.1 billion
Fundamental score: 10
Technical score: 7
Sentiment score: 10
Unum Group (UNM, $24.78) is another insurance sector stock upon which analysts cast a cautious eye.
As the nation’s largest provider of individual and group disability insurance products, the Street – with a consensus recommendation of Hold – remains leery of what COVID-19 means for Unum's top line going forward.
""We forecast operating revenues to be flat to up 2% in 2021, and to rise 1% to 2% in 2022,"" writes CFRA Research analyst Catherine Seifert (Hold). ""The degree to which operating revenues and sales rise will depend on UNM’s ability to leverage opportunities for growth amid an economic and labor market recovery, offset by some financial and competitive challenges.""
Danelfin's AI algos, however, share no such concerns – at least over the next 90 or so trading days – with UNM among the platform's top stocks to watch. Unum's perfect 10 AI Score, led by equally perfect fundamental and sentiment grades, should allow shares to catch up to the broader market before the year is out.
Although UNM stock is positive for the year-to-date, its 8% gain trails the S&P 500 by about 8 percentage points. But a perfect sentiment reading in 10 of 12 past weeks, three consecutive weeks of steady and positive technicals, and seven straight weeks of perfect 10 fundamental readings have shares set to break out.
As noted above, analysts are mostly on the sidelines when it comes to UNM's longer-term prospects. Of the 10 pros issuing opinions on the stock tracked by S&P Global Market Intelligence, one says Strong Buy, eight have it at Hold and one calls it a Sell.

1. Kemper
Market value: $4.3 billion
Fundamental score: 10
Technical score: 8
Sentiment score: 9
Kemper (KMPR, $67.10) stock is off nearly 13% for the year-to-date, hurt by a nation getting back to business and life as usual after a prolonged period of pandemic-induced hunkering down at home. 
Kemper is one of the largest writers of specialty personal lines of insurance in the U.S., with property casualty insurance accounting for approximately 86% of its premiums. The issue with the company these days is that its PC insurance business is predominantly personal auto.
""Auto losses are rising due to a rebounding economy, inflationary pressures and a tougher litigation environment,"" writes William Blair equity research analyst Adam Klauber (Market Perform). ""While the company is taking corrective actions to turn the tide in auto, this will likely take several quarters to produce results, and earnings should remain under pressure in the near term.""
Happily for shareholders, tactical investors or anyone else feeling opportunistic, Danelfin says the stock is ready to rebound in a big way over the next few months. 
KMPR's perfect 10 AI Score is bolstered by a 10 for fundamental factors – a level it's maintained for eight consecutive weeks. Technicals have ranged between 8 and 9 for four straight weeks, while sentiment hasn't fallen below a grade of 8 on a weekly basis since late May.
Add it all up, and KMPR leads Danelfin's list of stocks to watch with perfect 10 AI Scores as of Sept. 25.  
The Street is mostly bullish on the name, as well. True, only five analysts cover the stock, but their consensus recommendation stands at Buy. One rates KMPR at Strong Buy, three say Buy and one has it at Hold. Their average price target of $80.75 gives KMPR stock implied upside of about 20% in the next 12 months or so.

After getting hammered on Tuesday, the stock market tried to find its footing on Wednesday. But the market isn’t doing a very good job convincing investors that it has bottomed. With that in mind, let’s look at a few top stock trades for Thursday.
Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 1: Lucid Motors (LCID)

I have not been all that optimistic on Lucid Motors (NASDAQ:LCID) when it comes to the business, but we have been hammering this thing on the technicals.
Remember, we were buyers on the aggressive long setup as LCID stock reclaimed $17.50. Then, the stock reclaimed the key $21 level, followed by its key moving averages. Now, we’re finding resistance right where it’s been drawn for an entire month.
See that the 10-day moving average continues to buoy Lucid stock and let’s see if we get a push up toward $30. Above $30, and this stock could run even further.

At this point, though, investors should have been or should be locking in at least some profit, in my opinion.
Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 2: DraftKings (DKNG)

Like other growth stocks, DraftKings (NASDAQ:DKNG) has been under pressure. However, the company’s intention to go for a $22 billion mergers and acquisitions (M&A) move — when it itself only has about a$20 billion market capitalization — has clearly convinced some investors to de-risk by selling the stock.
It’s now down in seven of the past eight sessions.
With Tuesday’s decline below $50.72, we technically had a monthly-down rotation in DKNG stock. So that’s a level bulls need to reclaim if they want to squeeze the stock back up to the 50-day and 200-day moving averages.
Above that opens the door back to $60-plus.
On the downside, however, let’s see if the stock can fetch a bounce at uptrend support. Below that mark may put the 21-month moving average on the table.
Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 3: Dollar Tree (DLTR)

Source: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider
Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR) ripped higher on Wednesday, climbing more than 16% to $100. That said, it’s a fairly messy chart, which is why I used the weekly instead of the daily.
Back above the key $97 level and the 200-week moving average now, shares are struggling with the weekly VWAP measure and the 21-week moving average.
If the stock can push above those measures, it puts the 50-week in play. Above the 50-week and the third-quarter high is on the table near $107.

On the downside, though, a move below $97 bulls may having bulls wanting to exercise some caution. Otherwise, buyers can be long against this level.
Top Trades for Tomorrow No. 4: Editas Medicine (EDIT)

Click to Enlarge
Source: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider
Editas Medicine (NASDAQ:EDIT) is enjoying the opposite price action from DLTR, down almost 19% and crashing through several key levels and moving averages. The most recent of which was uptrend support (blue line).
Now down four days in a row, Editas has fallen more than 31% in that span.
If it can reclaim uptrend support, look for a move back up toward the 200-day moving average and the gap-fill area. Above that could put the second gap-fill in play near the 50-day moving average.
On the downside, however, the $37.63 level and 21-month moving average could be on the table.

It put a lid on technology stocks (-0.1%), which finished with the day's second-worst sector performance. Instead, investors were interested in defense. Utility stocks (+1.5%), consumer staples (+0.9%) and healthcare (+0.8%) led the markets higher, with notable gains coming from the likes of Eli Lilly (LLY, +4.0%), Sempra Energy (SRE, +3.1%) and ConAgra (CAG, +3.0%).
Even so, the major indices coughed up much of the day's progress during the session's final hour. The result was small gains for the Dow (+0.3% to 34,390) and S&P 500 (+0.2% to 4,359), while the tech-heavy Nasdaq finished with a 0.2% loss to 14,512.

NEW YORK, Sept 29 (Reuters) - Wall Street ended firmer on Wednesday in a partial rebound from the previous day's broad sell-off, with remarks from U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and the ongoing debt ceiling debate keeping a lid on gains.
The S&P 500 index .SPX and the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI advanced, but the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC closed lower as Treasury yields halted their ascent. Defensive sectors took the lead as investors sought stability in the volatile market.
All three remain on course to post monthly declines, with the bellwether S&P 500 snapping a seven-month winning streak.
""The same story we've seen for a couple of weeks,"" said Oliver Pursche, senior vice president at Wealthspire Advisors, in New York.
""Investors are concerned about three things: the eventual taper of bond purchases by the Fed, ongoing inflation with Chairman Powell saying it's going to stick around longer than initially expected, and the debt ceiling issue that congress is grappling with.""
Powell, speaking at a European Central Bank event, expressed frustration over persistent supply chain woes which could keep inflation elevated for longer than expected.
The stock market strengthened following his remarks.
""Powell has been very good at delivering the news officially that everyone knows is coming,"" Pursche said.

NEW YORK, Sept 29 (Reuters) - Wall Street seesawed in choppy trading on Wednesday, regaining some of the ground lost in the previous session's broad sell-off although initial gains were capped by concern over remarks from U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and the ongoing debt ceiling debate.
All three major U.S. stock indexes ticked higher as Treasury yields halted their ascent, with defensive sectors taking the lead as investors sought stability in the volatile market.
Still, all three remain on course to post monthly declines, with the bellwether S&P 500 .SPXsnapping a seven-month winning streak.
""We've had a rough patch, and you can't say we're done with these volatile days. September and October are weak for the market,"" said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia.
""We've had seven 'up' months, so having a down month on what's usually the weakest month of the year, especially with cross-currents of inflation and the prospect of higher taxes, doesn't seem that concerning to me.""
Powell, speaking at a European Central Bank event, expressed frustration over persistent supply chain woes which could keep inflation elevated for longer than expected.
Extended wrangling on Capitol Hill over funding the government even as the Friday deadline approached, and concerns over potential shutdowns and a U.S. credit default.
""The biggest negative surprise over the next couple of days could come from Washington and that could result in weakness until they raise the debt ceiling because there really is no alternative,"" Tuz added.
U.S. Treasury yields paused after a runup in recent days as the debt ceiling debate unfolded in Washington.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 256.64 points, or 0.75%, to 34,556.63; the S&P 500 .SPX gained 28.41 points, or 0.65%, at 4,381.04; and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 56.88 points, or 0.39%, at 14,603.56.

That's what we saw Wednesday morning as investors seemed more comfortable taking a more optimistic stance about the longer-term prospects for the economy and the market. Nevertheless, the gains weren't all that large compared to the size of Tuesday's declines. As of 11:30 a.m. EDT, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES: ^DJI) was up 195 points to 34,495. The S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) moved higher by 24 points to 4,376, and the Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) regained 53 points to 14,599.
Helping to pave the way higher were a couple of stocks that have been under pressure lately. Dollar Tree (NASDAQ: DLTR) announced a big strategic shift that could have huge implications for its business going forward. Meanwhile, Boeing (NYSE: BA) appears to be taking steps to shore itself up even in the face of ongoing challenges for its airline customers.

Dollar Tree breaks the buck
Shares of Dollar Tree jumped more than 16% on Wednesday. The discount retailer is looking to go beyond its name, adding new price points that could dramatically expand its addressable market.
Dollar Tree has been testing new ideas, including its Combo and Dollar Tree Plus store formats, in an effort to figure out how best to respond to changing consumer behavior. After seeing positive customer reactions from its efforts, Dollar Tree has now decided to make more merchandise available at prices greater than $1 in a select set of its original Dollar Tree-branded locations.
Dollar Tree Plus is slated to have $1, $3, and $5 products, with the goal of having 500 locations by year end and 2,000 stores by the end of fiscal 2022. In the long run, the company expects 5,000 Plus store locations by 2024. Meanwhile, the Combo store concept takes the lessons of Plus and applies them by offering multiprice product assortments to traditional Dollar Tree customers. Either way, adding higher price points makes it possible for the company to pass through higher costs while still offering good value to consumers.
At the same time, Dollar Tree signaled that it believes its own stock is a discount value as well. It added more than $1 billion to its existing stock buyback program, boosting the total authorization to $2.5 billion. That could provide some upward support for Dollar Tree stock that will be especially welcome after the decline in the share price over the past several months.
Boeing gains altitude
Elsewhere, shares of Boeing were up nearly 5%. The aerospace manufacturing giant got some good news from China and received favorable comments from stock analysts.
Boeing announced that its latest 737 MAX test flight in China went well. The flight happened last month, but Boeing's comments came amid hopes that the aircraft could finally get off the ground in the world's most populous nation. Even though the 737 MAX has resumed flying in the U.S. and elsewhere, China has thus far failed to follow suit, extending its grounding beyond the two-year mark.
Boeing also earned an upgrade from Bernstein, which boosted its rating from market perform to outperform and increased its price target by $27 to $279 per share. Bernstein believes that global travel activity is finally set to rebound sharply, and rising commercial airline traffic should help not only the airlines themselves but also manufacturers like Boeing.
Even so, Boeing still faces internal challenges. With orders starting to come in again, Boeing must get its deliveries back on track to restore confidence among its customers. Otherwise, the company faces a highly uncertain future despite its status as one of two giants in the duopolistic industry.

Sept 29 (Reuters) - Gains in defensive shares and Boeing helped the Dow and the S&P 500 index recover some lost ground on Wednesday after concerns over inflation and rising Treasury yields sparked one of Wall Street's worst selloffs this year.
Eight of the 11 major S&P sectors advanced, with healthcare .SPXHC, consumer staples .SPLRCS, utilities .SPLRCU and real estate .SPLRCR rising between 0.7% and 1.6%.
Investors stuck to relatively stable sectors as concerns over economic growth and a possible government shutdown rattled sentiment.
Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell on Wednesday also warned of economic uncertainty in the medium-term, and that inflation was likely to remain elevated this year.
A 3.3% jump in shares of Boeing Co BA.N also lifted the blue-chip Dow .DJI and the benchmark S&P 500 .SPX.
Boeing said its 737 MAX test flight for China's aviation regulator last month was successful and the planemaker hopes a two-year grounding will be lifted this year.
The Nasdaq lagged its peers as major technology stocks including Alphabet Inc GOOGL.O and Facebook FB.O remained under pressure from relatively high Treasury yields. Expectations of higher inflation are likely to keep yields elevated this year.
""I think there was a very rapid adjustment to what was a more hawkish Fed (last week) and the realization that inflation might be a little stickier than transitory,"" said Bob Shea, chief executive officer at TrimTabs Asset Management in New York.
""We are going to have short-term volatility around dysfunction of our very divided government. In the end they usually are forced to do the right thing, but watching that typically is an uncomfortable and volatile time period for the market.""
The U.S. Congress has just two days left before the federal government begins shutting many of its operations unless Democrats manage to pass a bill providing new funding for the fiscal year that begins on Friday.
JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N Chief Executive Jamie Dimon also cautioned a U.S. credit default would be a ""potentially catastrophic"" event.
The S&P 500 index is now set to break its seven-month winning streak as fears about China Evergrande's default, potentially higher corporate taxes and a sooner-than expected tapering by the Fed clouded investor sentiment in what is usually a seasonally weak month.
At 12:27 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI was up 102.30 points, or 0.30%, at 34,402.29, the S&P 500 .SPX was up 6.90 points, or 0.16%, at 4,359.53, and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC was down 37.51 points, or 0.26%, at 14,509.17.
Among other movers, Dollar Tree Inc DLTR.O jumped 15% after the discount retailer boosted its share buyback plan to a total of $2.5 billion.
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 1.42-to-1 ratio on the NYSE. Declining issues outnumbered advancers for a 1.13-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.
The S&P index recorded three new 52-week highs and two new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 21 new highs and 108 new lows.

But if you pay close attention, you might find that its key financial indicators look quite decent, which could mean that the stock could potentially rise in the long-term given how markets usually reward more resilient long-term fundamentals. Specifically, we decided to study Dollar Tree's ROE in this article.
Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits.
How To Calculate Return On Equity?
The formula for ROE is:
Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity
So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Dollar Tree is:
21% = US$1.5b ÷ US$7.0b (Based on the trailing twelve months to July 2021).
The 'return' is the yearly profit. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.21.
Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?
So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.
A Side By Side comparison of Dollar Tree's Earnings Growth And 21% ROE
To start with, Dollar Tree's ROE looks acceptable. Even when compared to the industry average of 19% the company's ROE looks quite decent. As you might expect, the 2.7% net income decline reported by Dollar Tree is a bit of a surprise. We reckon that there could be some other factors at play here that are preventing the company's growth. Such as, the company pays out a huge portion of its earnings as dividends, or is faced with competitive pressures.
We then compared Dollar Tree's performance with the industry and found that the company has shrunk its earnings at a slower rate than the industry earnings which has seen its earnings shrink by 8.0% in the same period. This does offer shareholders some relief
NasdaqGS:DLTR Past Earnings Growth September 29th 2021
Earnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Is DLTR fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value has everything you need to know.
Is Dollar Tree Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?
Because Dollar Tree doesn't pay any dividends, we infer that it is retaining all of its profits, which is rather perplexing when you consider the fact that there is no earnings growth to show for it. So there could be some other explanations in that regard. For instance, the company's business may be deteriorating.
Summary
Overall, we feel that Dollar Tree certainly does have some positive factors to consider. Yet, the low earnings growth is a bit concerning, especially given that the company has a high rate of return and is reinvesting ma huge portion of its profits. By the looks of it, there could be some other factors, not necessarily in control of the business, that's preventing growth. With that said, we studied the latest analyst forecasts and found that while the company has shrunk its earnings in the past, analysts expect its earnings to grow in the future.

Emily Flippen: Welcome to Industry Focus. My name is Emily Flippen, and I'll be joined by Asit Sharma today, as we dive into America's favorite publicly traded convenience store, Casey's General Store. If you're listening today, it's Sept. 14th, but we're actually pre-recording today's episode. Hey, Asit, how are you?
Asit Sharma: I'm good Emily. I'm happy to be a generalist today as we talk about Casey's General Store.
Flippen: I loved the read in for today's show because I did say this is America's favorite publicly traded convenience store, and I think that sounds like a really wonderful thing to say about Casey's General Store. But I'm not confident that anybody listening, and I'm happy to be proven wrong, can name another publicly traded convenience store. In part because I feel like convenience stores just aren't the most interesting investment, and I'm happy to be proven wrong during today's show. But what I do know is that I am a loyal Wawa fan. If Wawa was publicly traded, I am convinced Casey's would lose its title as America's favorite. But I think until we get to the point of that long-awaited Wawa IPO, we'll have to settle to talk about Casey's today.
Sharma: Yeah. You stumped me on that lead in, Emily, because I can't think of another publicly traded C-store in America. Now, a couple came to mind that are foreign, I think it is Couche-Tard, if I remember correctly, there's a Canadian convenience store chain. There's also a 7-Eleven in Japan. I think they're still publicly traded. But yeah, in the wide world of convenience stores, there's so many fascinating ones strung across the United States. We've got one in your area and in mine a little bit further South, Sheetz, that's rapidly growing, and I think they're also in the Midwest. There's so many but the one we're going to talk about today is one of the more fun convenience stores to walk into and to experience.
Flippen: Yes. This is a Midwestern powerhouse, and I imagine my comments about Wawa and your comments about Sheetz. Maybe you are irritating some people, especially those around areas like Iowa, who possibly love Casey's General Store. They really do have a cult following in the Midwest. They have more than 2,200 stores across 16 states, and they're really centralized in locations that have less than 5,000 residents. Management thinks that by positioning Casey's General Stores which sell things like grocery items, and food, but also obviously fuel, which makes up a large majority of their revenue. By selling these items, they are actually filling a need in these local communities where national chains aren't available.
Sharma: I buy that argument, actually. I think this is something that the management of chains like Dollar Store and Dollar Tree also believe in, because they fill this niche needs. When you're in a rural area, as you say, an area with fewer than 5,000 residents, there's a high probability that's a food desert, there is a high probability, it's a fuel desert, and a high probability which we'll get to in a moment that it's a pizza desert. But maybe you could talk a little bit as I just tease that. Are they making all of their money, their gross revenue from fuel being a convenience store or is there a more diversified story here, Emily?
Flippen: Yes. Around 40% of their gross revenue over the past three years did come from non-fuel items. That's good because the non-fuel item, so again, things you go into the store to buy: grocery or food items, they carry a higher margin, and they represented more than 70% of net revenue in 2020. But it's still worth noting that more than 50% of that gross revenue is coming from fuel. This is a very low margin for them. It tends to be very volatile because as people know, while they may look at their quarterly performance and see revenue up 50% year over year. We're coming off of 2020 where fuel prices were very low and travel was much lower than it was in prior years, so it's an element of their business that's a little bit outside of their control. I'm happy to be corrected, but when I look at this business and analyze its performance, I'm much more focused on that 40% of gross revenue coming from things that are inside of their control, so anything that's happening inside the Casey's stores themselves.
Sharma: I agree. I think that Casey's management also sees it this way. They have been attuned to working with more volume on the fuel side and incrementally improving the margins, which we can talk about in a bit. But all the excitement for Casey's happens when you walk in from the customer side and for management's perspective as well. They've invested a lot in their store presentations over the past couple of years, and they're using technology to a greater degree than they had in the past. In fact, Casey's management team sees part of their food service in the store as a QSR concept, a quick-service restaurant concept. They take their best practices from the quick-service industry. They modeled themselves after companies like McDonald's. In fact, they just launched a breakfast line and this gives you an idea if you're not from the Midwest, what Casey's is. Because if I told you that this is a convenience store chain. In many parts of the country, you're thinking there's some items on the shelf when I walk in. There's maybe one person behind the cash register. There's a fountain for coffee and drinks, maybe there's a little hot dog stand on the counter, this type of thing, or a kiosk with Dunkin Donuts. But Casey's is so much more. They strive to be, as I said, a company that's supplying you food options if you happen to be in these rural areas.
Flippen: I know you've looked at Casey's maybe two, three years ago, I'm curious was that thesis a few years ago for Casey's as well, is that people are going to come in and have a great experience with prepared food, or was it still more your traditional old-school convenient store? Has that changed over the past few years?
Sharma: I think that it was the case then, and it's only more the case now. I looked at this company in 2019, and at that point, they had a new CEO whose name is Darren Rebelez. I hope I'm pronouncing that correctly. Darren Rebelez was very focused at that time on the two big-picture things that you've alighted on Emily. He spoke to investors about improving those gross fuel margins, which were, at that time, around $0.25, $0.26 per gallon, or just think of this as 26% margins on fuel, he wanted to improve those every year. Now, there is a lot that goes into improving your margins on fuel. It's a very complicated business. Volumes can play a part where you promote your higher fuel pricing, that is as a district gets a little more urban, you've got more ability to charge a cent higher and still not lose to competition. It's really hard to explain how long-term their margins are going to fluctuate. But the bottom line is in those two years, fuel margins are up by about 20 percentage points. I don't know how sticky that's going to be.
The other thing that Darren Rebelez has talked a lot about was improving the food service, improving technology. Think of our ability to order via mobile devices that was key in 2019. I think it helped them during COVID where they saw some of their traffic decline. They have a much better digital experience today. The other thing that I will mention about their food is that their loyalty program now is much more robust under Rebelez's leadership. He's finding ways to make sure you get in store when you might not even be thinking about it. The broad strategy looks like this. They've got what they call curation. They hit everyone who's in the loyalty program with a big offer. Then they go down another level, which is more of a targeted promotional message for certain groups. They get the data and they say, here's a big cohort. These are the Emilys who come in twice a week. We know that the Emilys usually do X and so they hit that group. But those make up about 80% of their promotional targeting, 20% is individualized, or they go directly to Emily and say, ""Emily, just come in today, we're going to give you 10% off this really nice pizza because we know you love pizza.""
Flippen: I do.
Sharma: I do, too. Part of the investment here in the coming years, we're going to see that flip. They are going to use individual targeting. That'll be 80% of how they market and the other forms of marketing, the curation, the segmentation, those are going to dwindle down to about 20%. I really like the long-term things that Rebelez has done since he's come in. Like this introduction of breakfast, which we know has been very lucrative for companies like McDonald's and Wendy's that have nothing to do with the convenience business. The edge here is that Casey's has people preparing food, they say from scratch, I don't think it's from scratch, but it's a lot closer than what's going on in the Sheetz, which also has some people behind what looks like kitchen equipment. It sounds comical to say these things, but they're the types of initiatives that drive margin when your customer base doesn't have a lot of other options. I think that's part of the reason why Casey's is so beloved. I didn't mean to go on this long extended digression here on the strategy, but I think it's genius.
Flippen: I agree with you in part because I think I've had this firsthand experience with Wawa. I know this is a similar experience that people have at Buc-ee's, B-U-C-C-E-E-S, not the Bucky's that was actually acquired by Casey's General Store earlier this year. But people have the experience where they walk in and they almost view the convenience stores as, I'm going to call it, my happy place. They get fancy drinks made like lattes, cappuccinos. They can order specialized food and it's an experience within itself and honestly, I buy into it as an opportunity for convenience stores. I will say I'm a little surprised that their strategy hasn't performed better over the past couple of years. I don't have a lot of businesses to compare it to again, because Casey's is really the only pure-play publicly traded U.S.-based convenience store that is pursuing this strategy. But when I looked at their same-store sales for things like prepared food and fountain, it's actually been negative so far in 2021, negative throughout 2020, and been on a general decline since 2017. I'm surprised it's not performing better. I want to be generous here and say, I'm sure the pandemic has a lot to do with how their business has been handled the last couple of years, but I do wish those numbers were ticking upwards.
Sharma: Well, one of the things that we don't expect out of convenience stores is they'll have a lot of pricing power. Some of the initiatives that I talked about can contribute pricing power, but you need volume, too. The idea of same-store sales declining is surprising in this picture. The other thing that I'll note along that line when I looked at this business a couple of years ago, they were getting a lot of profit from prepared foods, which they still are. I think the prepared food and beverages segment had at that time about 62% gross profitability, just leading the business in gross profitability. It's still really high today, but it's trailed down by a couple of percentage points, I think now it's about 60.5%. I was a bit surprised because my expectation was that they would be able to improve gross margin with these types of loyalty investments, with the mobile investments. Part of this may have to do with some gas competition, though. We do know that the C-store space is competitive, so more competitors are coming in. As soon as you get within a couple of mile radius of another gas station, that's the driver of traffic into your store. If price is normalized among two gas stations, once you're not the only player in town in a population of 5,500, you might lose some traffic that normally would be yours. You can do a lot of these, what I call near-genius moves, but still not see the benefits.
I'm wondering if some of the encroaching independent gas stations and other chains are now forcing Casey's to compete on price on that fuel level in a bigger way than they were before. If that's what's hurting traffic, then this might be something that doesn't get solved overnight and I haven't really followed this company. So great that you were proposing to do this one, Emily, because I looked at it in 2019 and I wrote about it. But at that point, maybe something in my mind was telling me, I like this. It's such a great brand in the Midwest, but it seems like it could be vulnerable to some competition. I'm really curious to know if that's actually what's happened over the past couple of years.
Flippen: I think there is a silver lining here and they did have their quarterly reports on the 8th of September, so pretty recently. One of the things that stood out to me with their private-label sales. To your point, I think this is something that Casey's launched, I believe it was a year or two ago because of maybe losing a bit of margin on the pricing power. When you go private label as inherently a larger margin for yourself as a retailer, and so they're seeking private label items, things like chips and snacks and nuts, Casey-branded items in their stores. They had a goal of over the next three, four years, reaching 10% private-label sales in their store. That's the industry average. They expected to have to build up to that over a number of years. I'll tell you what the private label sales have just taken off. I think they are around 1% after the year they launched, their most recent quarter was over 4%, and they're ahead of target in terms of expanding that private label business of getting to 10% in 2-3 years. Amazing performance in terms of their private-label sales. That says something positive to me about some of the loyalty, I guess. When you walk into a Casey's and you trust buying the Casey's nuts as opposed to the Planters peanuts, for instance. Maybe there's some loyalty there and maybe they can expand that private label up to 10%, which could make a meaningful change in terms of their margin profile.
Sharma: Absolutely. If the drivers of same-store sales really start to pick up, then you get some momentum. This episode I think is going to air roughly close to two years to the date that I wrote about the new CEO coming on board and his initiatives, his thoughts at that time. Largely they've executed on that front, but looking at the stock chart, since then, the company has only appreciated 15% in those two years. Sometimes, however, you fix one lever and make it so strong that when the next lever is just pulled at equal weight, you double the effect. What if they start to see better traffic if let's say some of the pulls into the business, like this individually targeted marketing message, they're going to be rolling out to various customers in their loyalty program. If those things start to drive more traffic versus having to pull people in via competitiveness of gas prices against competitors, then maybe the stock has some fuel not to overuse a word we've said a lot today that will help Casey's realize the fruit of all this labor, investment in technology, investment in food, in doing breakfast, all the kinds of really innovative looks that management has thrown at this company.
They need one good piece of momentum and whatever that is, that's dragging down the same-store sales, I believe part of that's probably traffic. Once that normalizes, if it does, I think you can see some better results. But Emily, you mentioned when we were prepping for this episode that if you look on an earnings basis, they're looking good, that margin profile is coming through. They had the highest adjusted EBITDA -- earnings before income, taxes, depreciation, amortization -- in Casey's history in this last quarter and they had their highest earnings per share this past quarter. Put that in the context of what looked like really big revenue growth for us was like 50% year-over-year revenue growth?
Flippen: It was.
Sharma: Is that going to stick around or what's going on there?
Flippen: I don't expect it will, and I think that's maybe where I struggle with this business looking forward. Again, when you think about more than 50% of their revenue coming from things like gas demand and fuel prices. That's a bit unpredictable, especially over the short term, over the long term, probably stabilizes out. But I also just think it comes down to execution on the part of Casey's management. You've been following this business longer than I have. Maybe there's a bit more, I think trust built up in this new CEO in terms of their ability to execute. I think I find myself getting a little bit concerned over things like labor shortages. They had a really good year last year because of the pandemic. They cut back on staff, they cut back on hours. But as those people started coming back to work into 2021, labor costs and operating expenses have expanded. There's a 24% expansion in operating costs year over year, and nearly 40% of that came from labor expenses alone. Convenience stores in general, somewhat low-margin business. I think whether or not this ends up being the type of business that beats the market over the next five years comes entirely down to some aspects of things that are outside of their control, like fuel demand. But also can management execute on generating store traffic and customer loyalty at the same level we've seen other private convenience stores perform in? I don't know if I have a great answer to that, but they're certainly trying.
Sharma: I think for me, the external factors are really hard to deal with so I'm not a buyer of Casey's. Again, this is maybe why I took a deep look into it a few years ago. Haven't really followed it closely, but I want to put us in the shoes of someone who already owns the stock, who maybe lives in the Midwest and is a fan of this really popular brand and just interested in owning a local business. What would you say to that person looking forward to the next five years? My part of it would be, hold onto those shares. I know they've underperformed the market for the last couple of years, but I don't feel here that they are in a declining position. I think those external factors you mentioned are really strong. I am wary of gas price competition, but I think this is a management team that is executing pretty well. I think they've got decent chances, all things considered to make money. By that, we mean that if you're holding the stock, it should rise. That's all we mean by making money. That's different from maybe beating the S&P 500 index. I think it could perform alongside the index if certain things fall in place. That is, they can get some yield off of the private label. They start to see yield from having basically kitchens in-house that attracts more of a non-gas-related or a non-fuel-up-related visit.
There are ways over time they can have more of a dependable revenue stream. But to me, despite the fact that the stock hasn't really performed very well, It's not a sell if you're holding the stock. I would say, I'll go out on a limb and say my advice is, you can hang on to it, especially if you are a fan of Casey's store. You would know the brand better than we do. If Emily was in the same position, she owns some Wawa shares, I'm guessing, maybe she would consider hanging onto those if this had been your experience, but I'll be quiet now to hear your perspectives before we head out the door.
Flippen: We've been doing this too long because I had this whole thing prepared about how I was in no position to judge because if I was holding Wawa shares, I would certainly continue to hold them if they were in this exact position. I'm a huge fan of that business. I'm right there alongside you if you're a big fan of Casey's and it's a place that you also visit on a nearly daily basis as I do Wawa. Shout out to Wawa. Then not a bad business by no means a bad business. It'll definitely be one to watch, though. I'm really excited to see how management executes, but until then, Asit, thank you so much for always coming on and providing your insights. I know this one's pre-recorded palooza. We have a lot of taping to do before we all head out on vacation so there's a lot of work. I and our listeners appreciate it.
Sharma: Well, Emily, it's been great fun for me as it always will. My parting shots for you and listeners, I'm going to get some coffee this afternoon because we've been doing our pre-taped palooza, and you and I are going to be apart. I think you're away next week. I'm away the week after. I'm going to get some coffee to fuel up, but shout out to Casey's because they are putting in new coffee in their convenience stores with a grind to drip machine. It's a little higher end, it's going to be that much better.
Flippen: Higher end than Wawa.
Sharma: Yeah. Wawa, you better bring your game in the coming quarters.

2021-09-21 00:00:00+00:00,June 2022 Options Now Available For Dollar Tree (DLTR),DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/june-2022-options-now-available-for-dollar-tree-dltr-2021-09-21,,,"Investors in Dollar Tree Inc (Symbol: DLTR) saw new options begin trading today, for the June 2022 expiration. One of the key inputs that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 269 days until expiration the newly trading contracts represent a potential opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the DLTR options chain for the new June 2022 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $85.00 strike price has a current bid of $7.45. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $85.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $77.55 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of DLTR, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $86.71/share today.
Because the $85.00 strike represents an approximate 2% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 100%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 8.76% return on the cash commitment, or 11.89% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Dollar Tree Inc, and highlighting in green where the $85.00 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $90.00 strike price has a current bid of $7.45. If an investor was to purchase shares of DLTR stock at the current price level of $86.71/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $90.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 12.39% if the stock gets called away at the June 2022 expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if DLTR shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Dollar Tree Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing DLTR's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $90.00 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $90.00 strike represents an approximate 4% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 8.59% boost of extra return to the investor, or 11.66% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.
Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $86.71) to be 30%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

But Miniso says it's moving quickly to take advantage of lower rents in the pandemic-hit U.S. economy, and Vincent Huang, a company vice president responsible for overseas business, told Reuters he ultimately sees potential for ""thousands"" of U.S. stores.
The plan highlights the vaulting ambition of a company founded just eight years ago in Guangzhou that now reels in about $1.41 billion in annual revenue, and is listed in New York with a $4 billion market value. Shares have dropped 2.3% since its October 2020 float, amid a broad COVID-induced retail slump, but it counts the likes of Chinese tech giant Tencent 0700.HK and Hillhouse Capital among investors.
The expansion also comes at a pivotal moment for malls across the United States, with many storied retail names having succumbed to the scything downturn in sales that swiftly followed the first wave of the coronavirus pandemic in 2020.
Among brands that disappeared from the U.S. retail landscape was Flying Tiger Copenhagen, a Danish variety store chain that is a rival to Miniso in many markets around the world, but closed its 13 U.S. outlets in November last year.
With some 4,800 stores around the world in more than 90 countries, Miniso will have 54 outlets in the United States by the end of this year, up from 30 at the start, Huang said.
""We choose to expand our presence in the U.S. now for several reasons, including that the cost of a new store opening following COVID-19 is lower,"" Huang said in a recent interview.
The new stores include the November opening in the recently launched Tangram mall in Flushing, New York - an area known for a vibrant Asian-American community - of Miniso's first outlet in the city, what Huang called a ""flagship"" store taking up 3,300 square feet of space, slightly bigger than a tennis court, selling everything from neck pillows to notebooks and make-up.
'STRATEGIC MARKET'
Expansion costs in the United States had fallen by about 20% mainly due to rental cuts and the pandemic had also made it easier to secure good locations, he said.
""We have always believed that we are an international business and North America is our strategic market,"" he said.
Miniso describes itself as ""a Japanese-inspired lifestyle product retailer"", and has in the past been compared to the Muji chain operated by Tokyo-listed Ryohin Keikaku 7543.T.
But Miniso's busy stores and bargains place it in a segment occupied by Japan's renowned $1 store chain, Daiso Industries - present in the United States since 2005, with a network of nearly 80 stores including a first East Coast branch also in Flushing.
Miniso doesn't disclose exact sales numbers for stores in the United States, where it opened its first outlet in California in 2017, but last month it reported it booked about 20% of its 9.07 billion yuan ($1.41 billion) overall revenue for the fiscal year ended June from its 1,800 overseas stores, in countries such as Mexico, Indonesia and India.
Huang said Miniso's U.S. sales have recovered to pre-COVID-19 levels, with sales in the first half of 2021 seeing a rise of 73% year on the year. ""We are more popular than ever since the pandemic,"" he said.
Helping drive that popularity have been product collaboration collections in recent years with leading trademark holders including Disney DIS.N, Coca-Cola KO.N and Marvel Entertainment, resulting in items like Mickey Mouse facial cream, Coca-Cola ceramic mugs and Spider Man mouse pads.
""Ultimately, consumers do not care whether we are Chinese or Japanese, American or European,"" said Huang. ""What concerns consumers is whether they can buy good value products with the least amount of money.""

2021-09-14 00:00:00+00:00,First Week of January 2024 Options Trading For Dollar Tree (DLTR),DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/first-week-of-january-2024-options-trading-for-dollar-tree-dltr-2021-09-14,,,"Investors in Dollar Tree Inc (Symbol: DLTR) saw new options begin trading this week, for the January 2024 expiration. One of the key data points that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 857 days until expiration the newly trading contracts represent a possible opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the DLTR options chain for the new January 2024 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $85.00 strike price has a current bid of $12.50. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $85.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $72.50 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of DLTR, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $88.11/share today.
Because the $85.00 strike represents an approximate 4% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 63%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 14.71% return on the cash commitment, or 6.26% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Dollar Tree Inc, and highlighting in green where the $85.00 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $90.00 strike price has a current bid of $14.40. If an investor was to purchase shares of DLTR stock at the current price level of $88.11/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $90.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 18.49% if the stock gets called away at the January 2024 expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if DLTR shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Dollar Tree Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing DLTR's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $90.00 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $90.00 strike represents an approximate 2% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 42%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 16.34% boost of extra return to the investor, or 6.96% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.
The implied volatility in the put contract example, as well as the call contract example, are both approximately 34%.
Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $88.11) to be 30%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.
