2021-02-24 00:00:00+00:00,Dollar Tree is Now Oversold (DLTR),DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/dollar-tree-is-now-oversold-dltr-2021-02-24,,,"Legendary investor Warren Buffett advises to be fearful when others are greedy, and be greedy when others are fearful. One way we can try to measure the level of fear in a given stock is through a technical analysis indicator called the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which measures momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30.
In trading on Wednesday, shares of Dollar Tree Inc (Symbol: DLTR) entered into oversold territory, hitting an RSI reading of 28.4, after changing hands as low as $99.73 per share. By comparison, the current RSI reading of the S&P 500 ETF (SPY) is 56.5. A bullish investor could look at DLTR's 28.4 RSI reading today as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side. The chart below shows the one year performance of DLTR shares:
Looking at the chart above, DLTR's low point in its 52 week range is $60.20 per share, with $115.45 as the 52 week high point — that compares with a last trade of $100.83.

2021-02-24 00:00:00+00:00,Is Dollar General Stock a Buy?,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/is-dollar-general-stock-a-buy-2021-02-24,,,"If you're thinking Dollar General's (NYSE: DG) best days are behind it, you're not alone. Analysts are calling for sharply slowing sales growth this year, leading to an outright contraction in earnings. This is a key reason its stock has been moving lower since October: Investors are simply taking things at their face value.
But the recent pullback is more likely to be an opportunity than an omen. This discounter has a few more growth cards to play against rival dollar stores like Big Lots and Dollar Tree than it's currently getting credit for, and it's better equipped to handle a looming increase in the nation's minimum wage than most people appreciate.

A tough act to follow
Although three-fourths of Americans live within five miles of a store, three-fourths of the retailer's more than 17,000 locations are in communities with populations of less than 20,000. This strategy means Dollar General doesn't have to compete head to head with companies like Walmart in many of its markets.
Less obvious but perhaps more important, discounters like Dollar General cater to lower-income consumers, and most of their new stores are opening in lower-income areas.
Still, the company's growth has been impressive. While not reaching Amazon-like levels of coronavirus-driven growth, Dollar General's year-to-date sales were up 23% year over year through its fiscal 2020 third quarter (which ended Oct. 30). Net income was up more than 70% over the same period, and the company's fiscal fourth-quarter is expected to show similar top and bottom-line growth.
But with the anniversary of COVID-19's arrival in the U.S. upon us, consumer goods retailers have a problem: Year-ago comparable-store sales are on the verge of looking much less impressive. After a likely 21% uptick in fiscal 2020 sales, Dollar General's revenue growth is projected to slide to just over 1% in the current year. And the consensus earnings estimate of $10.71 per share for fiscal 2020, up 59% from the prior year, is expected to slide back to $10.07 in the current year.
In light of this tough comparison, the stock's recent weakness comes as no real surprise. However, this mindset underestimates what Dollar General will be able to do once the pandemic finally abates.
Smart initiatives
Although buried by more riveting headlines, the growth plans Dollar General had made before the pandemic disrupted everything are still in place.
Case in point: The company intends to build 1,050 new stores this year and remodel 1,750 more. That's a tall order given COVID-19-related complications, except maybe it isn't. Dollar General reported with its third-quarter results that it was on pace to build around 1,000 new stores in fiscal 2020 and remodel about 1,670 locales.
In the same vein, around 600 more locations will begin selling fresh produce this year, up from the roughly 1,000 DG Fresh stores now. Meanwhile, many stores that don't sell perishables will still be getting an upgrade. A non-consumables initiative put in place all the way back in 2018, as a means of enhancing sales of higher-margin goods, has been implemented at more than 5,600 stores thus far.
Less than half of Dollar General's stores have been improved in at least one way or another within the past several years, but that's not a liability. It simply means most stores have yet to be equipped to make the most of their square footage.
Other new growth-driving initiatives include DG Pickup and DG GO. The former allows customers to make online purchases and retrieve them at a nearby store. It's now offered nearly nationwide, previously being available at only 2,500 stores as of the end of July. DG GO is a self-checkout option allowing for a completely contactless shopping experience.
So we've never actually seen the new-and-improved Dollar General compete with the likes of Big Lots and Dollar Tree in a post-pandemic retail environment. The lackluster 2021 outlooks from analysts arguably discount just how competitive this company was already becoming before the pandemic began and continued to become during the crisis (those outlooks call for growth to pick back up in 2022 and beyond, by the way).

A higher minimum wage helps more than it hurts
There's an 800-pound gorilla in the room that calls the company's growth prospects into question. That's the effort to pump up the nation's minimum hourly pay to $15 by 2025. Dollar General employs 157,000 workers, many of whom currently earn considerably less. Jefferies analyst Randal Konik believes a large cohort of the company's employees only earn a bit more than half that, posing a huge cost risk to the brick-and-mortar chain.
Such concerns may be overblown, though. Selling, administrative, and general expenses only account for about 21% of the retailer's costs as a percentage of revenue, while merchandise amounts to 68%. And even then, not all of those selling and administrative costs are linked to employees currently earning less than $15 per hour.
Indeed, a nationwide increase in minimum hourly pay would ultimately put more disposable income into consumers' pockets without necessarily lifting those workers into the middle of the middle class. A full-time employee earning $15 per hour brings home around $31,000 per year, which is still Dollar General's demographic sweet spot. The company's core customers are families living in households with an average annual income of $40,000 or less. If anything, a minimum-wage increase would do more net good than harm by better empowering these consumers.
All of a sudden, the sell-off since October's peak looks like a mistake and a chance to step in at a discount before things pick up again in the near future.

2021-02-22 00:00:00+00:00,EXCLUSIVE-Discount retailer Dollar General takes steps to find possible CEO successor -sources,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/exclusive-discount-retailer-dollar-general-takes-steps-to-find-possible-ceo-successor,,,"By Jessica DiNapoli
Feb 22 (Reuters) - Discount chain Dollar General Corp DG.N, one of the few U.S. retailers thriving during the COVID-19 pandemic, is taking steps to find a potential successor to Chief Executive Todd Vasos, people familiar with the matter said on Monday.
While no decision has been made about Vasos stepping down, Dollar General has started conversations with headhunting firms and is considering candidates, the sources said.
Dollar General has been looking within its ranks and will assess the performance of its top executives against those at rival companies, the sources said. Dollar General Chief Operating Officer Jeff Owen is under consideration, one of the sources added.
The sources requested anonymity because the matter is confidential.
A Dollar General spokesman said Vasos had not communicated any plans to the company regarding a potential departure after his contract ends in June, noting it was ""merely good governance"" to plan for a transition. Vasos' contract renews automatically on an annual basis in June unless terminated or renegotiated.
""We have been speaking with management consulting firms related to executive development programs and as part of our succession planning process. We have not entered into a contract with any such firm to date,"" the spokesman said.
Vasos has expanded Dollar General's offerings to include more fresh produce and is wooing higher-income shoppers with new products in categories such as home decor, in a bid to stave off competition from large rivals such as Walmart Inc WMT.N and Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O.
Dollar General has also invested heavily in private label brands, developing lines for items ranging from cat food to shampoo. It has added more distribution centers to supply its stores with dairy products, deli meats and frozen entrees. It has more than 16,000 stores, often in areas underserved by other retailers.
Dollar General shares have risen 170% since Vasos became CEO in 2015, compared to a 115% rise in the S&P 500 General Merchandise Stores index over the same period.
The COVID-19 outbreak has boosted Dollar General's sales, as shoppers stay home more and buy more household necessities. Dollar General operates in small communities with few retailers.
The Goodlettsville, Tennessee-based company has taken steps to protect its more than 157,000 workers during the pandemic, and announced last month that it would pay its hourly and salaried workers for receiving COVID-19 vaccines.
It also said it would award $50 million in appreciation bonuses to its frontline workers in its fourth quarter, for a total of up to about $173 million for fiscal 2020.

2021-02-20 00:00:00+00:00,3 Stocks to Buy Ahead of the Next Market Crash,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-stocks-to-buy-ahead-of-the-next-market-crash-2021-02-20,,,"We might not know exactly when the next market crash is coming, but we know it's a certainty to occur at some point. Accepting market cycles is part of investing, but preparing your portfolio for downturns can be an important part of protecting your gains. If your allocation is too risky, you might want to consider adding stocks that perform well during recessions and market downturns. These usually won't give you spectacular growth during bull markets, but they probably won't tank nearly as hard as the high-flyers.
Stability with utilities
Utilities is one of the classic defensive sectors that is known to perform well during recessions. When people reign in spending on housing, big-ticket items, vacations, and dining, they are less likely to turn off the electricity, water, or heating in their homes. As a result, utility providers have relatively stable businesses that tend to have slow growth and limited disruptions across economic cycles.
Eversource Energy (NYSE: ES) provides natural gas, electricity, and water utility services to 4.3 million customers in Connecticut, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire. The stock's forward P/E ratio of 21.9 and enterprise value-to-EBITDA of 14.1 are low enough in the current market to provide a relative cushion if valuations were to drop in a market crash. Eversource also pays a 2% dividend yield to provide returns while you ride out a downturn. Risk-averse investors will also like the fact that Eversource carries relatively low debt among utilities, with debt-to-equity ratio of only 1.17 and a 3.88 interest coverage ratio.

Consumer staples
During tough times, consumers still purchase groceries, household items, and home-care goods. Companies that own popular consumer staples brands are often less volatile during recessions and market crashes. They'll never be great sources of growth, but they're stable.
Procter & Gamble (NYSE: PG) offers consumer packaged goods in the home care, cleaning, beauty, grooming, and personal care categories. The company's portfolio includes numerous well-known brands, including Bounty, Crest, Dawn, Downy, Febreeze, Gain, Gillette, Head & Shoulders, Oral-B, Olay, Pampers, Pantene, Tide, and Vicks. A broad portfolio of basic goods sold in 70 countries is going to hold up well in any recession, so Procter & Gamble's fundamentals will remain steady.
This isn't the type of stock that will ever attract soaring valuation multiples, so there's less room to fall when the market crashes. P&G trades at a modest forward P/E ratio of 22.9 and EV/EBITDA of 16.2, so the share prices are anchored by the company's profits. The stock also pays a healthy 2.5% dividend yield at a sustainable 59% payout ratio. That's a decent return for when the market tanks.
Discount stores experience more demand during recessions
Consumers become more discerning during income insecurity. Total retail spending usually decreases during recessions, and budget-conscious households start bargain shopping. Retailers that can provide basic goods at attractive value actually experience increasing demand as people substitute away from more expensive items.
Dollar Tree (NASDAQ: DLTR) operates more than 15,000 dollar stores in 48 U.S. states and Canada. While the S&P 500 was falling more than 40% from 2007 into early 2009, Dollar Tree shares were actually roughly where they started. General merchandise of basic goods at the lowest price point brings obvious value to consumers. If the next market crash is caused by weak economic conditions in the U.S., then Dollar Tree's financial performance is likely to remain steady.
Dollar Tree shares trade at a 17.2 forward P/E ratio and EV/EBITDA of 16. Investors looking to limit risk in their equity portfolios are likely to increase holdings in this stock, which should limit losses during the next market crash.

2021-02-17 00:00:00+00:00,3 Reasons Dollar Tree Is a Buy,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-reasons-dollar-tree-is-a-buy-2021-02-17,,,"Dollar Tree's (NASDAQ: DLTR) business was strong in 2020, as consumers spent more on staples like groceries and household goods. The stock-up effect created by the coronavirus pandemic helped many necessities-focused retailers, and Dollar Tree saw its results boosted, with a 28.7% increase year over year in earnings per share during its third-quarter report (for the quarter ended Oct. 31, 2020). The prior quarter saw earnings per share increase by 44.7%.
While the current macro drivers will likely ease as coronavirus cases continue to decrease, Dollar Tree is still positioned to perform well over the long term.
Here are three reasons Dollar Tree's shares are worth a look.
Image source: Getty Images.
1. The Instacart partnership is a positive for the company
The Family Dollar division announced on Feb. 4 that it would partner with Instacart to offer same-day delivery of goods from more than 6,000 Family Dollar stores. This follows the successful pilot delivery program in 275 Family Dollar stores in late 2020.
While part of Dollar Tree's strategy is to have its 15,000-plus stores located in convenient areas near other stores and in dense neighborhoods, shoppers are increasingly expecting even more convenience. Offering delivery and buy-online-pickup-in-store options (BOPIS) allows the retailer to remain competitive with other discount retailers like Walmart and Target, which have strong omnichannel and same-day delivery options, as well as drive additional sales.
2. It's successfully executing a turnaround in the Family Dollar segment
Dollar Tree is continuing to invest in improving business at its Family Dollar stores. CEO Michael Witynski detailed the plan on the third-quarter earnings call: ""The key elements of our improvement plan include: improved merchandising and marketing, raising [the] stock, ... upgrading brand standards, creating a selling culture and refining our format strategy."" He also mentioned recent initiatives to boost sales like buy online, pickup in-store (BOPIS) and e-commerce.
Management's ongoing strategic improvement plan for Family Dollar, which comprised 46.5% of total company sales in the most recent third quarter, is bearing fruit. During fiscal year 2019 (ended Feb. 1, 2020), Dollar Tree closed over 400 Family Dollar stores and converted 200 Family Dollar stores into Dollar Trees as part of the plan. The company also renovated over 1,100 mature Family Dollar stores during that time. During the third quarter of 2020, Dollar Tree renovated 371 Family Dollar stores.
For the first nine months of 2020, Family Dollar's operating margin improved to 5%, from 2% during the same period a year ago. During the third quarter, the segment's net sales increased by 7.5% year over year.
3. The company is well-positioned given COVID-19 and economic uncertainty
As restrictions and cases of the coronavirus subside, Dollar Tree will continue to be well-positioned as a convenient and value-focused retailer. Even after a return to ""normalcy,"" there may be lingering economic uncertainty, which will likely boost business at retail outfits offering discount merchandise.
Furthermore, the company is implementing improvements to increase revenue in the competitive retail space. These efforts around merchandising and innovation should help with revenue and margins. The company's merchandising initiative of Dollar Tree Plus! (beginning in 2019), which offers additional products at multi-tiered prices points mostly between $3 and $5, should help margin expansion in the future. The discounter plans to roll out Dollar Tree Plus! to about 500 stores in 2021.
""We like the sales that these are the product that we're putting in there at the $3 and $5 price point are selling,"" Witynski said on the third-quarter earnings call. ""It's also selling at a much higher margin because it's discretionary product and we're able to manufacture these products and bring value to the customer.""
Overall, Dollar Tree looks well-positioned in the long term, with a reasonable valuation: 16.8 times forward P/E, below the S&P 500's average of 22.7. Given its ongoing strategic initiatives and positioning as a leader in value-focused retail, shares look like a solid investment.

2021-02-08 00:00:00+00:00,Forget Walmart: Here Are 3 Better Dividend Stocks,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/forget-walmart%3A-here-are-3-better-dividend-stocks-2021-02-08,,,"There are plenty of good things to say about Walmart (NYSE: WMT) from an investment perspective, but there are some better alternatives out there. Walmart investors love the company's stability, cash flows, and dividends. That's completely fair, but what if you discovered that there were similarly stable stocks that currently pay higher dividends and might even deliver better growth?
Walmart's wide geographical footprint and enormous breadth of product categories create a diverse set of revenue sources. It's a defensive and mostly recession-proof stock, and the company's investment in online sales channels in recent years has been an excellent development for long-term competitive positioning with constant pressure from the likes of Target (NYSE: TGT) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN).
Walmart is a dividend aristocrat that pays shareholders a 1.5% dividend yield, which is slightly below the S&P 500 average. The company has a low 31% dividend payout ratio, indicating that cash is being managed very conservatively and that the quarterly dividend could conceivably be at least doubled without negatively affecting operations.
Walmart shares have a 24.5 forward P/E ratio and a 5.0 price-to-book ratio. Everything about this company screams stability, there's very limited opportunity for any sort of rapid growth, and none of the valuation metrics seem especially cheap or expensive. I have nothing bad to say here, but I still think there are better alternatives. Here are three.

Johnson & Johnson
Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) is a fellow dividend aristocrat that makes money across a wide swath of the healthcare sector including a large portfolio of branded pharmaceuticals, medical and orthopedic devices, over-the-counter medications, home health products, and cosmetic and beauty items for consumers. These business lines make J&J a recession-resistant behemoth, though that level of diversification also limits the company's growth potential.
In that regard, J&J is very similar to Walmart. However, the stock differs in two very important ways. First, Johnson & Johnson pays a much higher dividend yield at 2.5%. The market does seem to be acknowledging that the healthcare giant's 72% payout ratio means that it is more likely to cut (or at least less likely to raise) its distributions if financials suffer in the future, but a 72% payout ratio is still completely manageable. Furthermore, J&J's forward P/E ratio is only 17, and other valuation metrics indicate a similar discount to Walmart's pricing, despite the companies having comparable growth outlooks.
Johnson & Johnson is a diverse and stable company with positive demand catalysts in coming years due to demographics and growing middle classes around the globe. It will pay you higher dividends and is more likely to appreciate, based on valuation.
PepsiCo
PepsiCo (NASDAQ: PEP) maintains a large portfolio of well-known beverages, snacks, and food brands that are sold around the world. Pepsi can't boast the same level of diversification as Walmart or J&J, but its broad offering and global footprint are enough to make this a stable defensive stock. Income investors who want steady dividends should love the fact that this company is unlikely to endure fluctuating sales or rapid declines in demand.
Pepsi sets itself apart from Walmart with a 2.9% dividend yield, nearly double that of the big-box company. The 78% payout ratio might be on the high end for investors who are worried about long-term dividend growth, but Pepsi has been a Dividend Aristocrat for 47 years with an extensive history of steady growth. That's a great company to own, with nearly double the yield.
Realty Income
Realty Income (NYSE: O) is a REIT that primarily leases single-tenant retail properties. Retail real estate isn't the most stable place to plant your flag these days, with coronavirus keeping people out of stores and e-commerce challenging brick-and-mortar everywhere. Still, Realty Income Corp does as well as you can in this space. The company targets recession-resistant tenants with Walgreens (NASDAQ: WBA), Dollar General (NYSE: DG), 7-11, Dollar Tree (NASDAQ: DLTR), CVS (NYSE: CVS), and Walmart among their top 20 tenants by revenue. However, they are also heavily exposed to AMC and Regal Cinemas, as well as multiple gym chains.
Realty Income is a riskier proposition than the companies mentioned above, but investors are compensated with a much higher 4.65% dividend yield, and distributions are monthly rather than quarterly. The REIT managed to collect about 93% of rent due in the most recent quarter, despite the challenges presented by the coronavirus. Even with all the operational hardships, dividends over the past quarter were still only 85% of FFO. Modest growth is forecast for 2021, so this is a great recovery play for income investors who aren't scared to take on some risks.

A dominant online giant
Amazon has become so important to our everyday lives that it is hard to believe the company started as an online bookseller in 1994. With a relentless focus on innovation and serving the customer, it has become the dominant online retailer.
It has done so by providing buyers with low prices and fast delivery. With its popular Amazon Prime subscription, you receive free online shipping on numerous items and a streaming service for a $119 annual fee. It also sells devices like Alexa and the Kindle. And it's not just an online retailer anymore, with a physical presence that includes its own Amazon stores and Whole Foods shops.
Beyond retailing, Amazon Web Services (AWS) is its cloud-computing business that enables companies to use massive amounts of data to lower costs and make better decisions. This division is growing rapidly, with revenue reaching $45.4 billion in 2020, about 30% higher than 2019's figure. AWS also generates a high operating margin, nearly 30% for the period.
Even before the pandemic created higher online shopping demand, Amazon was a sales and profit growth machine. Sales went from $107 billion in 2015 to $280.5 billion in 2019. During that same period, operating income jumped from $2.2 billion to $14.5 billion.
In the fourth quarter, sales grew by 44% to $125.6 billion while operating income rose by 77% to $6.9 billion.
Growth isn't likely to slow down with the rollout of coronavirus vaccines and hopefully, a return to more normalcy. People are going to still order goods online now that they've seen how cheap and easy it is to do. AWS is also growing in importance as companies continue to include data in their decision-making.
Even though founder Jeff Bezos recently announced his decision to step down as CEO, he will still remain involved. Besides, Amazon is far from a one-person show. He'll be handing the reins over to longtime employee Andy Jassy, who heads the AWS division.
Can the retailer sustain momentum?
Dollar Tree has two brands: its namesake that offers all items for $1, and Family Dollar, which sells goods for up to $10 and was acquired in 2015. The businesses have had their issues, not the least of which is confronting significant competition from behemoth Amazon along with higher tariffs imposed by China on imported goods. Heading into 2020, Dollar Tree's same-store sales (comps) increases were about 2% for the last five years, and its operating income went from $1 billion to $1.3 billion. However, its margin contracted from 6.8% to 5.3%.
Last year was a different story, however. With the pandemic and resulting economic recession increasing demand for its low-cost offerings, Dollar Tree's fiscal third-quarter comps increased by 5.1%, with the previously lagging Family Dollar brand experiencing a 6.4% increase. The company's operating margin expanded from 6.2% to 7.5%. This period ended on Oct. 31.
It wasn't just the circumstances that drove the improvement. A couple of years ago, management introduced H2, a plan to improve Family Dollar's results. According to the company, those stores that have been renovated have comps that are more than 10 percentage points higher than those that haven't been updated.
The decision
While Dollar Tree's results have improved, it is still facing stiff competition that could rear its ugly head, hurting profits and the stock. Considering Amazon's dominance in online retail, that's the stock I'd put my money in.

2021-01-28 00:00:00+00:00,Analysts Expect RTH Will Reach $177,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/analysts-expect-rth-will-reach-%24177-2021-01-28,,,"Looking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at ETF Channel, we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. For the Retail ETF (Symbol: RTH), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $176.96 per unit.
With RTH trading at a recent price near $158.29 per unit, that means that analysts see 11.79% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of RTH's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are L Brands, Inc (Symbol: LB), The Gap Inc (Symbol: GPS), and Dollar Tree Inc (Symbol: DLTR). Although LB has traded at a recent price of $37.54/share, the average analyst target is 20.85% higher at $45.37/share. Similarly, GPS has 20.58% upside from the recent share price of $19.54 if the average analyst target price of $23.56/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting DLTR to reach a target price of $119.00/share, which is 17.17% above the recent price of $101.56. Below is a twelve month price history chart comparing the stock performance of LB, GPS, and DLTR:
Below is a summary table of the current analyst target prices discussed above:

The Gap Inc GPS $19.54 $23.56 20.58%
Dollar Tree Inc DLTR $101.56 $119.00 17.17%
Are analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past. These are questions that require further investor research.

While congress dithered over whether people should get another coronavirus stimulus check while states were forcing businesses to close or operate at less than capacity, consumers suffer to make ends meet.
The situation has clarified just how important the dollar store chains are to American consumers, and perhaps none more so than Dollar General (NYSE: DG), the leading deep discount retailer.
Yet its stock jumped over 34% in 2020 as many investors saw the value proposition inherent in its positioning, which raises the question of whether Dollar General can still be a millionaire-maker stock.
Image source: Dollar General.
Know your customer
Dollar General is the largest deep discount chain operating almost 17,000 stores at the end of October compared to over 15,200 by primary competitor Dollar Tree (NASDAQ: DLTR). It also has an enviable record of posting 30 consecutive years of comparable-store sales gains, and there's no reason to think it won't notch its 31st when it finally reports fourth quarter results.
For a chain with such massive sprawl to keep having customers come back again and again is a feat few other retailers of not even a similar size could hope to achieve.
It's been able to earn such loyalty from its customers because it understands them well. It locates its small-box stores in rural, suburban, and urban communities nearest to its core customer of low- and fixed-income residents who are all too often underserved by other, bigger retailers.
By focusing its product selection on quality name brands, and offering them at everyday low prices that are competitive with even the largest discount retailers like Walmart (NYSE: WMT) and Target (NYSE: TGT), it has carved out a niche for itself that's proven attractive to both consumers and investors.
Give them what they want
It's been a long time since dollar stores actually sold goods for just a dollar, though Dollar Tree continues to be unique in that manner, but even it is expanding its selection of higher priced goods.
What it learned from Dollar General was that customers still appreciate, and will respond to higher prices so long as the perceived value is still good. Most of Dollar General's prices are $10 or less, and though it sells home goods, apparel, and seasonal items, consumables are its primary focus, accounting for 78% of total sales.
Yet these also tend to be the lowest margin items, especially free produce, which has become a distinction for Dollar General among its competitors. Its DG Fresh initiative, a self-distribution model for fresh and frozen products, is designed to help boost sales and lower costs while ensuring it has enough product in stock. Even so, the discounter's profits surged 57% from last year in the third quarter.
Dollar General continues to expand into new markets and announced plans to open over 1,000 new stores in 2021, while renovating another 1,750 and relocating an additional 100 stores.
Is the stock a good value as the stores?
At 21 times next year's estimated earnings and 20 times the free cash flow it produces Dollar General's stock isn't a deep discount but it is a fair value for the potential it provides investors.
It offers a stable business model that is producing robust growth as its offerings resonate to keep consumers coming back. Despite its large existing footprint, the retailer still has plenty of markets to grow into and the conditions that have made it such a success this past year (let alone years past) unfortunately seem as though they will exist well into the future.
Even if conditions markedly improve, Dollar General will have developed renewed bonds of loyalty with its customers that it should be a millionaire-making stock for investors.

2021-01-07 00:00:00+00:00,Where Will Dollar Tree Be in 1 Year?,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/where-will-dollar-tree-be-in-1-year-2021-01-07,,,"Dollar Tree (NASDAQ: DLTR) has offered enough bargains to grow into a leading company in its retail niche. It debuted in March 1995, coincidentally at the split-adjusted price of just over $1 per share. Trading at about $107 per share today, Dollar Tree stock may have become the store's best dollar-store bargain.
However, retail remains a competitive industry, leading to questions about whether the company can deliver for investors over the next year. Let's take a closer look at the company to see whether it could become a great buy.
The state of Dollar Tree's business
Dollar Tree is a retail stock competing in the ultra-discounting business. It operates more than 15,600 stores under the Dollar Tree and Family Dollar names across the U.S. and Canada. Since it is a discounter among discounters, stores such as Dollar General (NYSE: DG) and Big Lots (NYSE: BIG) are its most direct competition.
Image source: Getty Images.
Dollar Tree is well-positioned for the current economic climate. Due to the COVID-19-induced economic decline, demand for low-cost products has risen. But the company has shown it can also grow in good times. Net sales growth was being reported before the coronavirus pandemic dominated the news as many better-heeled consumers were looking for bargains then as well.
However, Dollar Tree's competition continues to intensify. Even Amazon has begun to offer items in Dollar Tree's price range. Also, the company's performance has lagged that of Dollar General and the S&P 500 index since it acquired the Family Dollar line of stores in July 2015.
DLTR data by YCharts
Moreover, geopolitical forces have cheapened the company's value proposition. With increased government tariffs introduced over the past two years on products sourced from China, finding items to sell profitably for $1 has become more challenging.
To this end, it introduced a pilot program called Dollar Tree Plus!, which features items at $3 and $5 price points. Additionally, it has begun to address the problems associated with its Family Dollar stores. In 2019, it unveiled its H2 plan, which began the process of renovating Family Dollar's stores.
Financials point to massive growth, uncertainty
The investment in Family Dollar seems to have produced positive results. Since the pandemic began, this struggling subsidiary has now posted higher comparable sales growth than the Dollar Tree stores. Moreover, the increased need for discounts has helped boost profits. Consolidated net sales rose by almost 8% year over year, helping to take diluted earnings per share higher by 29%.
Dollar Tree stock rose by approximately 15% this year. Additionally, the stock sells for a forward P/E ratio of about 17. This forward multiple has changed little over the last two years. Uncertainty about future sales growth may explain the relative lack of investor reaction to the profit increase. The uncertainty could also be a result of the company declining to offer any forward guidance in its most recent earnings report. Moreover, at some point, investors know COVID-19 will fade, leading to a rise in employment. Even if net sales growth remains positive, higher incomes could dampen demand for low-cost goods.
Dollar Tree one year from now
Dollar Tree continues to register growth in good times and bad. Since discounting does not seem to go out of style, I think Dollar Tree's growth can continue.
However, its performance has lagged the S&P 500 in recent years, and investors have no reason to expect this to improve over the next year. With Amazon becoming a more direct peer, rising pressure on Dollar Tree's margins could limit profits. Furthermore, an economic recovery could reduce net sales growth during the year as more shoppers again turn to higher-priced items.
Dollar Tree will probably continue to deliver bargains to its customers. Nonetheless, investors looking for outsized stock gains in 2021 would probably earn higher returns elsewhere.

2021-12-30 00:00:00+00:00,Better Fintech Stock: Robinhood Markets vs. PayPal,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/better-fintech-stock%3A-robinhood-markets-vs.-paypal,,,"Robinhood Markets (NASDAQ: HOOD) and PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ: PYPL) represent two very different ways to invest in the growing fintech market.
Robinhood is the disruptive online brokerage that popularized commission-free stock and cryptocurrency trades. Its streamlined smartphone app and gamified user interface also made it a popular choice for younger investors.
PayPal is one of the largest online payment platforms in the world. It also provides ""buy now, pay later"" (BNPL) services, peer-to-peer payments through its Venmo app, cryptocurrency purchases, and other services.
Image source: Getty Images.
Investors treated these two stocks very differently after their public debuts. Robinhood went public in July 2021 at $38 per share, but it now trades roughly 50% below its IPO price. Meanwhile, PayPal's stock price has rallied more than 400% since it was spun off from eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY) in July 2015.
Will PayPal's scale and stability make it a better fintech investment for 2022? Or will Robinhood recover and outperform its larger industry peer?
Why did investors abandon Robinhood?
Robinhood's stock tumbled as investors fretted over its decelerating growth, its steep losses, and its looming regulatory challenges.
Robinhood's revenue surged 245% in 2020 as more retail investors loaded up on meme stocks and cryptocurrencies throughout the pandemic. But for 2021, it expects its revenue to grow by about 88%.
That's still an impressive growth rate, but Robinhood's number of monthly active users (MAUs), funded accounts, assets under custody (AUC), and average revenue per user (ARPU) all declined sequentially last quarter.
Robinhood blamed that slowdown on the market's waning interest in Dogecoin (CRYPTO: DOGE), which accounted for 40% of its cryptocurrency transaction-based revenue during the quarter. Competition from other free trading platforms also likely exacerbated that slowdown.
After squeezing out a slim profit in 2020, Robinhood racked up steep losses throughout the first nine months of 2021. Those losses can be attributed to an offering of convertible notes it issued to stay solvent during the Reddit-fueled short squeeze in early 2021, as well as massive stock-based compensation expenses for its top executives and insiders.
Robinhood still served 18.9 million MAUs last quarter, but its average account size was only about $3,500. Schwab (NYSE: SCHW), which served 32.9 million active brokerage accounts in its latest quarter, has an average account size of about $240,000. Therefore, Robinhood might have plenty of users, but its platform is still dwarfed by the traditional brokerages.
Meanwhile, U.S. regulators have been scrutinizing the payment for order flow (PFOF) model that subsidizes Robinhood's commission-free trades. PFOF trades are already banned in several countries, and a ban in the U.S. would inevitably force Robinhood to start charging commissions.
Analysts expect Robinhood's revenue to rise 91% in 2021, but decelerate to just 22% growth in 2022 as it remains deeply unprofitable. On the bright side, its stock trades at less than seven times next year's sales -- so its downside potential could be limited at these levels.
But PayPal also generated dismal returns in 2021
PayPal's growth since its split from eBay has been impressive, but the stock still shed nearly 20% of its value over the past 12 months.
Investors turned against PayPal after it posted two mixed earnings reports with soft guidance. PayPal's revenue rose 21% in 2020, while its adjusted earnings grew 31%. But for 2021, it expects its revenue and adjusted earnings to grow roughly 18% and 19%, respectively.
That deceleration, while mild, raises concerns about PayPal's ability to hit the ambitious growth targets it set at its investor day in early 2021. Specifically, PayPal believes it can more than double its annual revenue, from $21.45 billion in 2020 to over $50 billion in 2025, while increasing its earnings per share at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 22%. It also said it would increase its number of active accounts to 750 million -- representing a whopping 80% jump from its 416 million active accounts in its latest quarter.
PayPal's rumored interest in buying Pinterest (NYSE: PINS), which it subsequently denied, also suggests it might rely on costly acquisitions to hit its 2025 targets. That strategy would squeeze its operating margins, which already declined both sequentially and year over year last quarter.
Nonetheless, PayPal insists the growth of its new ""super app"" for various financial services, the rising acceptance of mobile payments globally, and Venmo's expansion into new markets -- such as its partnership with Amazon -- will help it hit those long-term targets.
Analysts expect PayPal's revenue and earnings to grow 18% and 14%, respectively, in 2022. Those estimates indicate PayPal's growth rates should remain stable, and its stock still looks reasonably valued at 35 times forward earnings and seven times next year's sales.
The obvious winner: PayPal
PayPal isn't a perfect fintech stock. It might have set the bar a bit too high for 2025, its rumored interest in Pinterest raises red flags, and it faces plenty of competition from other innovative fintech players like Block and Adyen.
However, it's definitely a better investment than Robinhood, for five simple reasons: Its growth is more stable, it's consistently profitable, it has a larger and more geographically diversified base of users, it doesn't rely on speculative cryptocurrencies, and it doesn't face any meaningful regulatory headwinds.

2021-12-29 00:00:00+00:00,Is eBay Stock a Smart Buy for 2022?,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/is-ebay-stock-a-smart-buy-for-2022,,,"eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY) was one of the prime beneficiaries of the coronavirus pandemic. Hundreds of millions of people worldwide were looking to avoid shopping inside stores and turned to online marketplaces like eBay to fill the void.
However, now that nearly 9 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines have been administered and world economies are reopening by removing restrictions on businesses, eBay is shedding customers. Despite the customer losses, eBay's stock is up 29% year to date, but that does not ensure it will have similar success in 2022. Let's look at the business and determine if it's a smart buy for the new year.
Image source: Getty Images.
eBay is taking a more significant share of sales
In its second quarter of 2020, eBay had 161 million active buyers, which increased to 166 million by the first quarter of 2021. That's when economic reopening gained momentum, and eBay started losing buyers. As of its most recent quarter ended Sept. 30, eBay was down to 154 million active buyers.
Note, eBay does not sell its customers any items. Instead, it is a platform that allows buyers and sellers to transact together. eBay takes a percentage of each transaction, and that's primarily how it earns revenue. The value of those transactions (gross merchandise value) has unsurprisingly declined as eBay has lost millions of buyers over the last few quarters -- falling from $21.7 billion in the third quarter of 2020 to $19.4 billion in Q3 2021.
Still, eBay managed to increase revenue during that same time from $2.2 billion to $2.5 billion. eBay achieved this feat by increasing the percentage it takes from each sale. Overall, eBay's take rate increased from 9.7% in Q3 last year to 12.1% in Q3 this year. That can partly explain eBay's stock price rise in 2021 despite the lower buyer totals.
A higher take rate is a structural improvement that could increase its revenue-generating potential over the long term. For instance, if eBay's gross merchandise volume can rebound to the same level as last year, and you combine it with the higher take rate, eBay's revenue will be higher.
eBay's management made another strategic decision -- to focus on higher-value customers. For instance, eBay would formerly send me a coupon for 15% off my total purchase every quarter. The promotion sometimes enticed me to make a purchase. However, management has all but eliminated such practices. As a result, sales and marketing expenses fell to 18.8% in its most recent quarter, down from 22.3% last year. Interestingly, the reduction in promotions may be another cause for eBay's customer losses mentioned earlier.
Overall, eBay management has made moves that reduce the customer value proposition and favor its revenue and profits. There is already evidence of buyers reacting negatively and leaving the platform. It would not be surprising if, in response to eBay's higher take rate, sellers start leaving the platform as well.
eBay's focus on profit margins is attractive
The company has done an excellent job on profitability -- it averaged a pre-tax income margin of 28.3% in the last decade. Meanwhile, eBay is challenged on revenue, which grew at a compounded annual rate of 1.2% in that same time.
eBay has not done as well on innovation; the site is essentially the same in 2021 as it was in 2010. Listing an item for sale is still a slow and tedious process.
That being said, eBay's stock is not expensive, trading at a price-to-free cash flow ratio of 17. Consistent profits, an inexpensive valuation, and an asset-lite business model trounce the lack of innovation and make eBay a stock to buy for 2022.

2021-12-28 00:00:00+00:00,Is PayPal Still a Buy After Falling 18% in 2021?,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/is-paypal-still-a-buy-after-falling-18-in-2021,,,"PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL), which has been at the forefront of digital payments for two decades, is not immune to the market's whims. Growing sales and profits aren't going to be enough to prevent the stock from finishing 2021 in the red.
As is the case with pandemic winners like Roku, Teledoc, and Zoom, investors have become pessimistic about PayPal's prospects in a post-pandemic world. Since hitting an all-time high of $308.53 in July, PayPal's stock has dropped 38%.
Is this fintech leader a buy after its poor performance in 2021?

The market is pessimistic
During the most recent quarterly update, management's disappointing guidance certainly hurt the stock. Forecasts of fourth-quarter revenue of $6.9 billion (at the midpoint) and 2022 estimated sales of close to $30 billion weren't well-received by Wall Street.
John Rainey, PayPal's CFO, admitted that coming up with a financial outlook in this environment is proving to be very challenging. ""If it weren't difficult enough to forecast with the reopening of the economy, we overlay eBay on top of the supply chain issues and inflationary pressures and the impact that can have on our business. And it makes it very complex to forecast,"" he said on the Q3 earnings call.
The extreme uncertainty in the economy today, propelled by the fast-spreading coronavirus omicron variant, definitely makes the near-term outlook unclear. Nevertheless, PayPal's revenue and net income continue marching higher with each passing quarter, making the stock's underperformance this year unwarranted.
PayPal is still dominating
I think it's best to take a step back and consider the bigger picture and long-term outlook for PayPal. The business has some positive developments working in its favor as we look ahead to 2022 and beyond.
By being the pioneer of the digital-payments space for more than 20 years, this long history has resulted in massive scale. PayPal currently has 383 million active individual accounts and 33 million active merchant accounts on its platform. This huge user base is a significant competitive advantage. Perhaps even more remarkable is that PayPal processed a whopping $310 billion in total payment volume during the third quarter, up 26% year over year.
PayPal is widely recognized as the leading payments brand when it comes to innovation in the industry. Earlier this year, the leadership team introduced an updated PayPal mobile app, with features like a full digital wallet, high-yield savings account, shopping deals and rewards, and bill pay. The functionality and ease of use is unmatched. Stock-trading capabilities are anticipated to be coming soon.
The potential for new acquisitions and partnerships also provide a nice tailwind for the business. PayPal's recent purchase of Japanese buy now, pay later enterprise Paidy extends the company's reach to the world's third-largest e-commerce market that still conducts 70% of purchases with cash. Additionally, the recently announced partnership with Amazon will allow U.S. customers to use Venmo as a checkout option on the e-commerce juggernaut's website and mobile app.
Consider buying shares
Despite missing Wall Street's revenue estimates for two straight quarters, PayPal's numbers still look solid. The user base is growing rapidly, engagement keeps ticking up, and the innovative culture is robust. Let's also not forget just how profitable this business is, generating a 21% free cash flow margin in Q3.
There are still a few trading days left, but 2021 is shaping up to be PayPal stock's first down year since it spun off and became a public company in July 2015. Nonetheless, it has produced a market-crushing return of more than 400% during that 6 1/2-year stretch. Even though the fundamentals remain intact, sentiment has soured on PayPal.
Smart investors should view this as a fantastic opportunity to buy shares right now.

The last six months of 2021 have not been kind to investors in PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) stock.
PYPL) logo overlays daylight photo of corporate building"" width=""300"" height=""169"">
Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com
From its peak closing price of $310.16 per share, PYPL stock has dipped nearly 40% (39.8% as of this writing) and now sits at $186.54.  
Investors have some reason to believe that PYPL stock was overvalued. For example, investors are becoming concerned that PayPal’s supremacy in digital payment solutions is being successfully eroded by competition.  
Also, the company’s long-anticipated breakup with eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) reached its conclusion in June. This was really a case of two companies that are moving in different directions.
As Dana Blankenhorn points out, PayPal is now a “fully grown banking operation.” Although the company delivered a solid first earnings report with significantly reduced eBay revenue, investors may be concerned about two consecutive quarters of slowing growth.  
The company is also facing questions about the consumer protections (or lack thereof) in its push into the buy now pay later (BNPL) arena.
Specifically, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) is  looking into how PayPal and other BNPL companies may be using user data and how these companies may be getting around existing consumer protection laws.  
7 of the Best Long-Term Stocks to Buy in 2022
That’s a lot for investors to process. As a company still recognized as part of the technology sector, PayPal faces the same headwinds that all tech stocks are enduring. 
With that said, the sell-off in PayPal looks overdone. And that’s why opportunistic investors should consider PYPL stock a solid choice as they look ahead to 2022. 
The Business Model is Sound 
The biggest reason I believe that the sell-off in PayPal is overdone is that none of the issues mentioned above changes the overall narrative for PayPal. The company remains one of the unquestioned leaders in the digital payment sector. In fact, it has an enviable market penetration rate of around 75%.  
And, as its recent partnership with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) shows, it has no problem adding clients to its roster. Specifically, starting in 2022 Amazon will offer the Venmo payment option at checkout on its webpage as well as the Amazon shopping app.  
Another reason to be bullish about PYPL stock can be found in the company’s financials.
In the first three quarters of 2021, PayPal has reported revenue of $18.45 billion. That’s 13% higher on a year-over-year basis and puts the company well on pace to eclipse the $21.46 billion in revenue it recorded in all of FY 2020.
The company is forecasting revenue to come in at $25.36 billion. And a similar story is on display with the company’s earnings which are up 17% on a year-over-year basis.  
Looking ahead to 2022, PayPal estimates its revenue will increase 18%. That’s slightly less than the 19% analysts were forecasting. That isn’t the growth of a struggling company.   
If you’re a fan of free cash flow (FCF) as a metric of financial health, you should pay attention to what Mark Hake recently wrote about how PayPal’s strong FCF makes the stock an undervalued option.  
PYPL Stock Is a Clear Buy-the-Dip Candidate 
If you don’t buy into that from a technical standpoint, consider the reaction of the analyst community. Since PayPal reported earnings, at least 20 analysts have lowered their price target for PYPL stock. However, it’s important to note that in every case the new price target is higher than the stock’s current price.  
As any investor knows, that doesn’t mean that PYPL stock doesn’t have further to drop. Investors will do what they want. However, it does seem that the stock has absorbed all the bad news.  
PayPal needs a bullish catalyst, and that might come when it reports earnings at the beginning of February. That’s a long winter’s night away, but it shouldn’t stop you from opening or adding to your position in PYPL stock.

2021-12-24 00:00:00+00:00,2 Top Tech Stocks to Buy During a Recession,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/2-top-tech-stocks-to-buy-during-a-recession,,,"We're days away from the end of 2021, and the S&P 500 has put on a master class in outperforming expectations. Even with its pullback in recent days, the broad market index has gained nearly 30% this year, more than double its long-term historical average.
Yet that just means we're another day closer to the inevitable market correction. Just as night follows day, a stock market crash is inevitable because market declines are a natural part of the normal business and investment cycle. No one can forecast exactly when it will strike, but smart investors realize it's best to prepare for the eventuality.

For as long as people have been investing, stretching even as far back to the Dutch tulip mania in the 1600s, busts have followed booms. And what a boom we've enjoyed! Since the bottom of the Great Recession, the S&P 500 has quadrupled in value.
2020's pandemic-driven 34% drop in the stock indexes within the span of just a few weeks was the worst on record. But savvy investors don't have to worry. These events are not a problem when you're invested in the right companies. Being prepared for the worst and hoping for the best means when the next stock market crash or correction occurs, you'll want to have your money invested in stocks that will help lead the way forward. Here are two tech stocks you'll want to buy.

1. Apple
The burden that inflation is imposing on consumers also poses a threat to some of the biggest, best-run businesses, like Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), which is currently benefiting from the smartphone upgrade cycle and the rollout of 5G network infrastructure. Any attempt by the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates to contain runaway inflation could cause an economic slowdown by making money more expensive to borrow. Stock valuations would also turn lower.
That's not necessarily bad news for investors who might find Apple's $2.8 trillion valuation a bit rich to buy into at the moment. The stock trades at 30 times trailing earnings, or about double its typical multiple. A correction would bring Apple back into the realm of the attainable, even as its business continues jogging forward.
Sales of the iPhone 13 are outpacing those of the iPhone 12 at the same time, but Apple reportedly warned suppliers that demand is waning as the calendar year progresses. It's not necessarily for a lack of consumer desire, but rather the global supply chain constraints that have made it difficult to find the product. Apple previously cut its iPhone production target by 10 million units from its original goal of 90 million.
Analysts think many consumers may choose to forgo the iPhone 13 and wait for the next upgrade. Coupled with a market crash, that could put Apple stock at a very attractive entry point with pent-up demand for the next iteration of the iPhone.

2. Amazon
Few companies are as essential to the working of the U.S. economy as Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN). It will account for 41.4% of all online spending in the U.S. this year, according to eMarketer estimates. At the same time, Amazon Web Services (AWS), its cloud infrastructure business, is on track to generate over $60 billion in annual revenue in 2021 based on its year-to-date performance. The company is responsible for thousands of web-based businesses and the federal government's ability to remain online, making Amazon crucial to a well-functioning economy.
That won't change if the stock market collapses. Its share of U.S. retail e-commerce sales will be more than 50% larger than the shares of the next nine e-commerce companies combined. Amazon's piece of the online market is nearly six times more than Walmart's second-place share at just 7.2%, and 10 times greater than third-place eBay. E-commerce data tracker Edge by Ascential expects Amazon will see $26.7 billion just in online grocery sales five from now years, or nearly double its current amount.
Amid rising prices and supply chain woes, Amazon has become a lifeline for many, and that will continue long after any financial restructuring. The stock gained 76% during the first year of the pandemic and took a breather during the reopening of the economy. Amazon shares have been relatively flat all year long. A correction would allow investors to buy a tech stock at a more reasonable valuation even as its crucial role only gets reinforced.

2021-12-23 00:00:00+00:00,Interesting EBAY Put And Call Options For February 2022,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/interesting-ebay-put-and-call-options-for-february-2022,,,"Investors in eBay Inc. (Symbol: EBAY) saw new options become available today, for the February 2022 expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the EBAY options chain for the new February 2022 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $64.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.84. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $64.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $62.16 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of EBAY, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $64.60/share today.
Because the $64.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 2.88% return on the cash commitment, or 24.40% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for eBay Inc., and highlighting in green where the $64.00 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $70.00 strike price has a current bid of 51 cents. If an investor was to purchase shares of EBAY stock at the current price level of $64.60/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $70.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 9.15% if the stock gets called away at the February 2022 expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if EBAY shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for eBay Inc., as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing EBAY's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $70.00 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $70.00 strike represents an approximate 8% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 0.79% boost of extra return to the investor, or 6.70% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.
Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $64.60) to be 33%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

2021-12-23 00:00:00+00:00,Is PayPal a Buy?,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/is-paypal-a-buy,,,"It's been a rough year for shareholders of digital payments leader PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ: PYPL). At Wednesday's close, PayPal's stock price was down 18% in 2021, but investors have weathered a 38% decline since the stock peaked in July.
And it's not like technology stocks or financial stocks -- the two sectors this fintech straddles -- are having bad years, generally speaking. Each sector is up roughly 30% this year, compared to a nearly 24% gain for the S&P 500. But payments companies like PayPal are struggling.
So why is PayPal down, and what does this mean for investors?
Image source: Getty Images.
Why PayPal's stock is down since July
There are several factors that have caused PayPal to pull back so sharply. The stock had been richly valued, coming off a strong year in 2020, when its price jumped 116%. The payments industry had been one of the segments of the economy that carried the market last year through a difficult period. With lockdowns and pandemic-related restrictions in place for most of the year, PayPal surged, with record revenue and huge gains in total payments volume (TPV) and net new users, as more people used digital payments due to social distancing rules and other restrictions.
That momentum carried over into the first half of 2021, as the stock closed at a high of $308.53 on July 23. But it started declining from there, as PayPal missed second-quarter earnings estimates, even though it still posted solid revenue and earnings growth. Part of that miss might have been from the fact that its former parent, eBay, was transitioning to a new payment provider.
In the latest quarter, PayPal was a mixed bag, as it beat earnings estimates but fell short of revenue estimates. TPV was also down compared to a year ago, but net new accounts were up. They were solid numbers overall, but were up against record performance in the third quarter of 2020.
The slower growth trajectory caused at least one Wall Street firm, Bernstein, to downgrade PayPal from buy to market perform. Among the concerns, the analyst cited increasing competition in the space, both from rivals like Block and other payment providers, as well as from the growing number of buy now, pay later (BNPL) companies. In fact, Block -- then called Square -- acquired one of the bigger BNPL players, Afterpay.
There were other factors that caused the stock to plunge further when the weather got colder. Rising inflation and the omicron variant raised new concerns about an economic slowdown, and that hit all payment providers. Also, the U.S. Justice Department launched an investigation into alleged financial incentives provided by Visa to top payment companies, including PayPal, which might have also scared investors.
PayPal looks good right now
The rapid run-up that PayPal experienced during the pandemic caused the stock price to run a little too hot, as the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio soared to over 100 in 2020 and was about 75 in July before it began to plunge. Now the stock's P/E ratio is around 46, which is more typical for PayPal since it re-entered the public markets in 2015. Its forward P/E is even lower, around 39. For investors, this presents a great buying opportunity.
Certainly, PayPal is facing greater competition than ever, but it is in a great position to continue its success over the long term. One reason is its efficiency, with a 24% return on equity and a 20% profit margin. It also has sound financials, with $5 billion in free cash flow and $7.8 billion in cash and cash equivalents. That gives it the foundation to not only ride out the downturn but to also invest to stay ahead of the competition. It has invested in its own in-house BNPL service, PayPal Credit, and it also bought Paidy, a BNPL firm from Japan to crack that market. PayPal also launched a service to invest in cryptocurrency and is exploring the idea of creating its own online stock trading platform.
In addition, while it lost eBay, which had accounted for only about 3% of TPV, the company signed a deal with Amazon that will allow consumers to use PayPal's Venmo at checkout starting next year. Venmo is already the largest mobile payment app, with more than 80 million users, and this should increase its market share.
Also, the company recently launched its PayPal ""super app,"" which includes all of its services in one place, which will help solidify its massive network of users and present better opportunities for cross-selling, promotions, and growth. Ultimately, its 430 million active PayPal users and 80 million Venmo accounts, along with its huge brand recognition, are the company's biggest advantages.
It all adds up to a stock that's likely going to be a long-term winner. And the recent pullback makes PayPal look even more attractive right now.

This video was recorded on Dec. 14, 2021.
Chris Hill: It's Tuesday, December 14th. Welcome to Market Foolery. I'm Chris Hill and before I welcome in a familiar voice, I want to share a little bit of news and that is producer Dan Boyd and I are moving. Later this month will be the last episode in this podcast feed because, to borrow from the great LeBron James, we're taking our talents to The Motley Fool Money feed. Starting in January, we're going to be turning Motley Fool Money into a daily show. Whether you started listening to this show in the past month, the past year, or you've been one of the dozens since we started this show in 2011, I really think you're going to like what's coming in January.
If we're not already following Motley Fool Money on whatever podcast platform you use, please do that because that is where you're going to be hearing from me and the other people that you're used to hearing on this show, starting in January. We want you to weigh in, we want to get your thoughts on the topics that you enjoy hearing about. We have a short four-question survey that we have put in the episode description, you can just click that link, it shouldn't take more than one minute to fill out. We do want to hear from you, so thank you for doing that. More details to come, but I am really excited for the next phase of Motley Fool podcasting. With that, let me welcome Asit Sharma. Thanks for being here.
Asit Sharma: Thank you for having me as always, Chris.
Chris Hill: We're going to dip into the Fool Mailbag. We've got two very different business types to discuss and we're going to start with Beyond Meat (NASDAQ: BYND) because shares are up more than seven percent this morning. The maker of plant-based meat substitutes got an analyst upgrade based on the potential for Beyond Meat's national launch with McDonald's (NYSE: MCD) possibly happening in the next few months. When I read this, I immediately thought of our colleague Emily Flippen because we talked about Beyond Meat briefly on the most recent episode of Motley Fool Money. In that case, it was the fact that Taco Bell had essentially rejected, they were going to have a little bit of a partnership with Taco Bell, Taco Bell essentially rejected the product that Beyond Meat had sent. We made the obvious joke that, ""Boy, when Taco Bell is rejecting you on quality, that's really saying something."" Emily immediately lead with, ""Hey, look, they've got partnerships with McDonald's and some other big national outfits."" This seems like for people who are bullish on Beyond Meat, this is the type of deal they want to see happen sooner rather than later.
Asit Sharma: I agree, Chris, if you're a Beyond Meat shareholder, this is good news. If you're the first mover in an industry and you bringing new technology to the market, whether we're talking software or here we have alternative meat or plant-based meat, it takes a lot of partnerships to get your brand accepted, it takes years of development, so much investment. In this case, you've got a business which has trouble making money, they have to spend on several fronts in new distribution, in the experimentation with new items, they build manufacturing capacity in Asia, a lot of new people to have to hire on.
Beyond Meat is in this long-term game of extending its brand while it's going to lose money. When you see something like this that McDonald's is going to move forward potentially in about 3-5 months with the McPlant and that the tests are going well as far as the analysts who recommend the stock this morning has been able to note with channel checks, I think you have that beginning of long-term traction coming. But it's always one step forward, one step back in this industry, it's an asset industry. We should stress here that the partnership with Taco Bell, both parties say is still strong, but you have these setbacks. I think for Beyond Meat, the trick is really going to be to capitalize on this brand and to penetrate even further into the grocery aisles, that's where over the long term, they'll make most of their money. But this is positive, brand is everything, and when you were present in the drive-thru with McDonald's, it's a huge boost.
Chris Hill: What is the potential you think for? I know, in general, we don't want to go into investments when we buy a stock, we don't want to go in with the mindset of, ""I really hope this company gets acquired."" But it seems to me is that Beyond Meat, and you can throw Impossible Foods in there as well, there is a greater than zero percent chance that someone comes along and says, ""We like what you are doing, we think you're going to do better inside of our ecosystem,"" and makes them an offer. What would you say the chances are that in three years, this is still a stand-alone public company?
Asit Sharma: I actually think, in this case, the chances are fairly high that they'll be here as a stand-alone company after several years. They play in a really specialized space in this market. They developed their own take on alternative meat, it depends on pea protein isolates. It's not something that readily lent itself just to plugging in and moving up in terms of scale, if you are an industrial produce. So we've got the big agro giants who might be want to consider taking this company over, but they already have their plant set up in place. I think for them, it's more about just the marketing of it to take what they've got in-house, repackage it, make it look good, and then spread it through their distribution footprint. I don't think they are just quite as interested in this little novel technique that Beyond Meat is using. For that, I don't see a lot of other big consumer packaged companies that might be interested. Just because of their own tech which is specialized, I feel like they're going to be around. Of course, and I'll look tomorrow, there'll be an announcement. I'm going to be proven wrong but at least for today, they will be a stand-alone company.
Chris Hill: I said we're going to talk about two very different types of businesses. Now that we've talked about plant-based meat substitutes, let's talk about pest control. Terminix Global, which is a pest control company based in Tennessee, is being acquired by a British rival Rentokil. It is a cash and stock deal worth 6.7 billion and shares of Terminix are up 20 percent, shares of Rentokil down 11 percent, which immediately makes me think that investors don't like what Rentokil is paying. They may like the deal, in principle, they don't like the price.
Asit Sharma: Before I comment on investors' reaction, Chris, I want to take a moment here to celebrate our friends across the pond and I'm not talking about Rentokil specifically, but I'm talking about our friends, the British, who are so great at coming up with really cool brand names based on Latin cognates. For those of you who watch All Creatures Great and Small, it's a PBS show, or have read the wonderful novels by James Herriot, you probably are familiar with the scene in which James Herriot, this young veterinarian, in turn of the century, 20th-century England, finds himself out late at night and has to stop at what is essentially an early form of a truck stop. He sides up to the counter and there are all these really huge rustic farmers and truckers sitting around. To look macho, he orders a Bovril, which is still around today.
This takes the Latin term for cow bovine and makes it into this manly beef tea. I love the way the British built their brands around the system. In that same timeframe, Rentokil was developed as a pesticide brand. It was originally called Entokil for insect, Latin for insect. But there was a trademark dispute, so the company became Rentokil. Anyway, kudos to the British for this. Now, as for the reaction in the stock prices, Rentokil has been a serial acquirer of other companies for decades. They usually do this without much regard for how the market is going to react. I think this is pretty much par for the course as far as Rentokil's management is concerned. This is a company that does specialize in the UK, in Europe, Asia, everywhere in pest control services. But they also play in the hygiene space, so they provide soaps, hand sanitizers, they rent all kinds of uniforms. We see some companies that are very similar here in the US like UniFirst.
For them, this is their typical acquisition to extend a footprint in a core business. This company trades at a total enterprise value to EBITDA, that is, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization of almost 19 times. But in Terminix, based in the US, of course, they're getting a company which trades at a slightly lower multiple. I believe it trades around 14 times when you take its total enterprise value versus its EBITDA, so it's a little bit of a bargain there. Terminix, I should note, also is a brand name formed from a Latin root term terminate, etc. We have two really fun brand names here that will merge together. I think this is a good acquisition for the British company. It's a slow-growth industry, Chris. Terminix has, I think, organic growth rate of something like four percent. You just don't soar in your year-over-year revenue when you're selling pest control services. On the other hand, they've modernized the way they go about it. They do use I think a wider range of technology. Some of that is more friendly for those who don't like the idea of harsh chemicals. They use a lot of tech to market.
Now, there's services. To me, this isn't a bad acquisition for Rentokil. I understand why Terminix shareholders are happy. I think, over time, this is accretive for the British company and we will turn out to be just another great acquisition fast forward past today to the next 3-5 years.
Chris Hill: Yeah. I think if you're a Terminix shareholder, you have to be happy with this deal because Rollins, which is a company we talk about from time to time, the parent company of Orkin is one of their rivals here in the United States and Rollins is just flat out a better stock, a better business. It's roughly twice the size of Terminix and the stock has outperformed Terminix. I think if you're a Terminix global shareholder, you're hoping that the immediate reaction with Rentokil stock is not so bad that they rethink the price that they are paying because I think you want this deal to go through.
Asit Sharma: Yeah, absolutely. I feel like the deal will go through. Rentokil tends to use a little bit more leverage in their operations. There will be some synergies there to realize. All in all, just changes a landscape that it doesn't see much transformation. I mean, there's glacial change in this industry, but fun deal to contemplate and really interesting acquisition in a time where maybe as we're in this post-COVID environment, Terminix is a little cheaper than it might have been. Again, think smart on Rentokil's part, and we will see in a year or so how this deal looks in retrospect.
Chris Hill: Got an email from Wayne Weinman in Seattle who writes, ""I have stock in GE right now. What happens to that stock in the breakup of GE when they split up the company in a few years? Does it stay at GE, does it convert to some new companies? Or has GE not said yet? The answer will determine if I cash in and put the money elsewhere or stay the course."" Thank you for that, Wayne. There are a couple of ways we can go here. I mean obviously, this is a question about General Electric, but it's a question for anyone who is dealing with either the breakup of the company or the spin-off of a company. We talked last week about Intel getting ready to spin-off Mobileye in 2022. That's something that Intel shareholders will have to deal with. In terms of GE proper, I believe the split up is happening over a multiyear period, isn't it?
Asit Sharma: Yeah, that's correct, Chris. This is going to happen over essentially two years. Next year, we will see the spin out of the healthcare business. It's going to be, I think, early in 2023. We shouldn't say next year we're still in 2021 by a few days. [laughs] But let's say early 2023. That will be a tax-free spin-off as these deals usually are. If you hold GE shares now in early 2023, you'll get shares of the new company, which itself will be publicly traded. I believe GE is going to retain roughly a 20 percent interest in that company. Then in 2024, GE will spin out its renewable energy business and current shareholders will get shares of that new company. Shareholders will then be left with what's going to be an aviation-focused company.
The original GE which was umpteen conglomerated business divisions just a few years ago is going to become a company that just focused on one industry. At the end of a long story of market dominance in the US. Not to get off on a tangent here, but to answer Wayne's question, he's trying to make a decision. Hey, do I hold shares? Do I sell these? Academic studies actually show that a parent company and you have to take this with a grain of salt, but by and large when parent company's spin-off smaller divisions that are faster growing, often the effect of something you wouldn't expect. The parent company does a little better in its share price than it might have otherwise. If you look over long periods of time, say a 5-7-10 year time horizon. That's for the reason that management of the parent company can focus on the true core business of the company. What happens to those spun-out companies? They tend to perform pretty well in most cases because you have a dedicated management team that focuses on what might and in many cases to have been ignored stepchild. Now, this is not true in GE's case. They had many stumbles among various divisions over the years, but I see something like this perhaps playing out. I think shares in all three companies have the potential to do well. They will be very competitive in these three big markets. Not to give any personalizedinvestment advicebecause we can't, Chris, but I think the average shareholder at GE should look to see what kind of potential there is in holding shares of three competitive companies in three growing industries and then make a decision.
Chris Hill: I mean, the reason I own shares of PayPal is because I was, and still am, an eBay shareholder. That spin-out has worked wonderfully for me and wonderfully for anyone else who is in the same situation. I'm not saying that's going to be the case with the various divisions that GE spins out. This is something I think we talked about at the time of the news and it's worth revisiting. It really does seem like it would be an overstatement to say to use the phrase like the depth of conglomerates. But I think it is accurate to say that conglomerates have lost their shine over the last 20 years. There is a less of a case for businesses like GE. My hunches will see fewer of them in the future.
Asit Sharma: I tend to agree, Chris. I think when technology changed at a slower rate, there was a lot to love about the biggest conglomerates because they were so dependable. They turned out really great cash flow. Could always rely on one or two divisions to step up in any given quarter if some were lagging. It seemed like a great recipe for long-term success for investors, but the rate of change is so fierce now in technology. It's difficult to stay on top of one industry. Just try now to stay dominant or close to dominant in three to four or five or seven or eight industries. Nearly impossible. That business structure makes less sense as time goes on. But the pendulum always swings back. There will be a time who knows when it will be maybe a few decades from now, where we will see something like this arise again. Maybe it will be tech conglomerates. I have no idea. Ideas go out of fashion and then conditions change and we take another look at businesses that have fallen out of favor. Maybe this model comes back, but for now, yeah, I think it's really hard to pull off these days.

2021-12-21 00:00:00+00:00,These 4 Measures Indicate That eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) Is Using Debt Safely,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/these-4-measures-indicate-that-ebay-nasdaq%3Aebay-is-using-debt-safely,,,"The external fund manager backed by Berkshire Hathaway's Charlie Munger, Li Lu, makes no bones about it when he says 'The biggest investment risk is not the volatility of prices, but whether you will suffer a permanent loss of capital.' When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. Importantly, eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY) does carry debt. But is this debt a concern to shareholders?
What Risk Does Debt Bring?
Generally speaking, debt only becomes a real problem when a company can't easily pay it off, either by raising capital or with its own cash flow. Part and parcel of capitalism is the process of 'creative destruction' where failed businesses are mercilessly liquidated by their bankers. While that is not too common, we often do see indebted companies permanently diluting shareholders because lenders force them to raise capital at a distressed price. Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return. When we examine debt levels, we first consider both cash and debt levels, together.
What Is eBay's Debt?
As you can see below, at the end of September 2021, eBay had US$9.08b of debt, up from US$7.76b a year ago. Click the image for more detail. But on the other hand it also has US$14.6b in cash, leading to a US$5.48b net cash position.
NasdaqGS:EBAY Debt to Equity History December 21st 2021
A Look At eBay's Liabilities
According to the last reported balance sheet, eBay had liabilities of US$5.30b due within 12 months, and liabilities of US$13.0b due beyond 12 months. On the other hand, it had cash of US$14.6b and US$660.0m worth of receivables due within a year. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$3.09b.
Since publicly traded eBay shares are worth a very impressive total of US$39.9b, it seems unlikely that this level of liabilities would be a major threat. However, we do think it is worth keeping an eye on its balance sheet strength, as it may change over time. While it does have liabilities worth noting, eBay also has more cash than debt, so we're pretty confident it can manage its debt safely.
Also good is that eBay grew its EBIT at 15% over the last year, further increasing its ability to manage debt. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if eBay can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts.
Finally, while the tax-man may adore accounting profits, lenders only accept cold hard cash. eBay may have net cash on the balance sheet, but it is still interesting to look at how well the business converts its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) to free cash flow, because that will influence both its need for, and its capacity to manage debt. Happily for any shareholders, eBay actually produced more free cash flow than EBIT over the last three years. That sort of strong cash generation warms our hearts like a puppy in a bumblebee suit.
Summing up
We could understand if investors are concerned about eBay's liabilities, but we can be reassured by the fact it has has net cash of US$5.48b. And it impressed us with free cash flow of US$2.6b, being 101% of its EBIT. So is eBay's debt a risk? It doesn't seem so to us. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. However, not all investment risk resides within the balance sheet - far from it. Be aware that eBay is showing 3 warning signs in our investment analysis , you should know about...
When all is said and done, sometimes its easier to focus on companies that don't even need debt. Readers can access a list of growth stocks with zero net debt 100% free, right now.

2021-12-19 00:00:00+00:00,3 Favorite Growth Stocks for 2022,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-favorite-growth-stocks-for-2022,,,"After enduring a year's worth of abuse, many growth stocks are now trading for an incredible long-term value. First there was the worry of a post-pandemic slowdown for tech, now higher interest rates and inflation fears are taking their toll -- but for top companies, neither negative situation will bring an end to the growth trend that they're riding higher.
As 2022 approaches, three Fool.com contributors share some of their favorite growth stocks for the new year: Zoom Video Communications (NASDAQ: ZM), Coinbase Global (NASDAQ: COIN), and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN).

The most obvious long-term bargain around?
Nicholas Rossolillo (Zoom): All fast-growing stocks inevitably take their lumps. Take a look at any of today's top tech giants, and you'll see many periods of steep double-digit percentage sell-offs.
Despite becoming a household name over the course of a year, Zoom is in just such a pullback right now. Shares are 70% down from their all-time highs posted over a year ago. Granted, enthusiasm had gotten way out of hand in 2020 when Zoom was an indispensable tool during lockdowns. But now the current has changed, and we could be at or near the low tide mark.
I realize that a lot of investors have been burned as Zoom has done nothing but tumble for what has now felt like an eternity. But hear me out. The company is still growing sales at a double-digit percentage pace, and it's wildly profitable -- adding over $1.5 billion in cash to its balance sheet on an annualized basis last quarter. And speaking of cash, Zoom has nearly 10% of its current $58 billion market cap in cash and short-term investments on balance at the bank. As the cloud-based video communications movement starts to refocus on enterprise use (Zoom Phone, Zoom Engagement Center, and other new use cases to replace legacy big business telecom services), Zoom has ample ability to spend on growth initiatives or to make acquisitions.
Trading for just 32 times trailing-12-month free cash flow-to-enterprise value, Zoom looks more like a value stock than it does a growth stock. Enduring vicious drawdowns like this is often the name of the game, but if this company's momentum continues into 2022, sooner or later shares will find a bottom and start rising again. I'm adding to my position as I ride out the Zoom storm.
The ultimate low-risk cryptocurrency investment
Anders Bylund (Coinbase): Cryptocurrency trading specialist Coinbase Global (NASDAQ: COIN) is my go-to recommendation for anyone who wants to invest in the newfangled digital assets market without picking individual cryptocurrencies.
If current market leaders Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) and Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) hold on to their market dominance for years to come while the market itself expands, that's a big win for Coinbase. If other blockchain tokens kick Ethereum and Bitcoin off their thrones in 2022 or 2030, Coinbase doesn't really mind -- as long as the trading activity in cryptocurrencies generally continues to rise.
And the company is actively staying on top of upcoming trends in the cryptocurrency sector. Coinbase started investing in non-fungible token (NFT) specialists way back in 2018, for example, and is preparing to launch an NFT service in the near future. This service might be a bit different from other NFT platforms.
""We'd like to make the Coinbase NFT a little bit more like Instagram as opposed to, say, an auction like eBay or something like that,"" CEO Brian Armstrong said on November's third-quarter earnings call. He continued:
I think having people that you can follow, your favorite artists or creators, and having a feed of content that is populated from those people you follow, that could be really powerful. And in addition, you can go in there and buy an NFT if you really like it and showcase in your own social profile. In addition to that, I think we can just make NFTs much easier to use. That's kind of a hallmark of what Coinbase tries to do out there to bring more and more people into the crypto space.
So I'm convinced that Coinbase should be able to stay relevant and profitable in nearly any market environment, as long as cryptocurrencies and blockchain protocols are here to stay. The only reason I don't own any Coinbase shares myself is because of the Motley Fool disclosure rules, which often won't let me touch various stocks -- including Coinbase today.
But those trading restrictions don't apply to you, dear reader, and this looks like a fantastic time to pick up some Coinbase shares. The stock is down 28% over the last month due to massive volatility in the cryptocurrency market -- which only boosts trading volumes, and that's good news for this company. I really would have bought some Coinbase stock today, if I only could.
The worst-performing FAANG stock of 2021 could be the best in 2022
Billy Duberstein (Amazon): As far as stocks go, Amazon has probably been the most boring one this year. After quickly doubling in the early days of the pandemic, the stock has flatlined for basically a year and a half. That made it the most underwhelming large-cap tech stock of 2021.
AMZN data by YCharts.
You can probably chalk up the malaise to Amazon's e-commerce business, which makes up an outsized portion of revenue. While that business boomed during the pandemic, growth has rapidly decelerated as the economy reopened in the second and third quarters. Last quarter, online stores saw only 3% revenue growth and third-party sellers saw 18% growth, far below the 37% and 53% respective growth in the prior-year quarter during the height of the pandemic. Meanwhile, supply chain disruptions and labor shortages have caused Amazon's costs to skyrocket. So its e-commerce business is suffering from lower revenue growth and higher costs -- not a great combination.
However, while e-commerce makes up the vast majority of its revenue, its two most profitable businesses are Amazon Web Services (AWS) and digital advertising, which falls under the ""other"" category in its financial statements. This year, those two segments actually accelerated their growth. Yet because Amazon's e-commerce business has underperformed, the company's overall top line may have disappointed investors looking at that one crude number.
I'd expect another year of strong growth for both AWS and digital ads in 2022, as the shift to cloud computing shows no signs of slowing, and digital ads continue to take share from traditional channels in a strong economy. Meanwhile, Amazon's e-commerce business will now have easier ""comps"" next year, and the company will have had more time to get its exploding costs under control.
As the worst-performing FAANG stock over the past year, I can easily see Amazon flipping the script in 2022.
