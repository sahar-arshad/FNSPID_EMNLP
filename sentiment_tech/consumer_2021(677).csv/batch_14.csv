2021-10-21 00:00:00+00:00,2 E-Commerce Stocks to Consider Buying Right Now,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/2-e-commerce-stocks-to-consider-buying-right-now-2021-10-21,,,"E-commerce companies offer a potentially lucrative area for investors. The segment was steadily growing its share of overall sales and then got a burst of growth at the pandemic onset when folks looked to avoid physical stores. The trend is unlikely to reverse, and e-commerce sales are estimated to continue taking a more significant percentage of overall sales in the long run.
That being said, two stocks that are likely to provide solid returns to investors in that environment are Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY).

Amazon is growing revenue faster
Global behemoth Amazon is growing revenue rapidly and efficiently. Over the last decade, Amazon has grown revenue at a compound annual rate of 27.3%. That took revenue from $48 billion in fiscal 2011 to $386 billion in 2020. What's more, the business is growing efficiently, and operating income in that same time increased from $862 million to $22.9 billion, increasing the operating profit margin from 1.8% to 5.9%.
One of the main drivers of efficiency for Amazon is skillfully adding fulfillment capacity. As you can imagine, adding warehouses near customers can reduce shipping time and the costs of shipping. However, in the near term, when it spends to build a new fulfillment center, Amazon has to spend on building, hiring, and training staff, and it takes time to get it all up and running. Over time, those investments have paid off, leading to an expanding operating profit margin.
In the last four quarters, Amazon has hired more than 450,000 employees. That's impressive considering the widespread complaints from businesses saying they can't find enough workers to fill open jobs. That means Amazon will likely be more competitive in its order fulfillment in the near term, which could make the difference between making the sale and losing a sale to a competitor.
That speed of delivery might be an insurmountable competitive advantage. It won't be easy for other e-commerce companies to match the speed and convenience Amazon offers.
eBay has higher profit margins
eBay is another e-commerce company poised to do well for shareholders. The company operates on a different business model than Amazon. Mainly, it takes an asset-light approach by leaving shipping and handling to sellers and buyers to determine. That relieves the need to operate expensive fulfillment centers. eBay maintains a platform where buyers and sellers meet, and eBay takes a percentage of each transaction as a fee for its service.
The decision has had the desired effect. While Amazon is increasing its operating profit margin, it is still nowhere near the level eBay produces. In fiscal 2020, eBay's operating profit margin was 26.4%, while Amazon's was 5.9%.
Similar to Amazon, eBay could do well against competitors during supply chain disruptions. First, it will not endure higher shipping expenses because it leaves that up to sellers. Second, in times of short supply, eBay benefits because resellers flood its platform with products that are out of stock at popular retailers and sell them at a markup. That phenomenon is likely to be prevalent for the next few quarters as the world grapples with shortages caused by the pandemic.
eBay and Amazon stock are inexpensive
Both eBay and Amazon have excellent near-term and long-term prospects. To make matters better for investors, they are trading at relatively inexpensive valuations.
Data by YCharts.
Amazon is trading at a relative discount to its forward price-to-earnings ratio of close to 100 late last year. And eBay is selling at nearly one-third the forward price-to-earnings ratio of Amazon. Given that they are generating healthy profits, have solid short-term and long-term prospects, and have relatively inexpensive valuations, eBay and Amazon are two e-commerce stocks that investors should consider buying right now.

2021-10-21 00:00:00+00:00,E-Commerce Stocks To Buy Ahead Of The Holiday Shopping Season,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/e-commerce-stocks-to-buy-ahead-of-the-holiday-shopping-season-2021-10-21,,,"Our theme of E-Commerce Stocks – which is comprised of U.S.-based e-commerce companies as well as logistics, and payment players, has returned about 16% year-to-date, slightly underperforming the S&P 500 which remains up by about 19.5% over the same period. The retail sector is poised for a strong holiday shopping season as consumers have more money to spend given the stimulus payments, strong trends in wages, and rising household wealth. Recent trends have been encouraging, with retail spending for the month of September rising 13.9% year-over-year per the Census Bureau, without adjusting for inflation. Although brick and mortar stores are likely to be big beneficiaries as people increasingly venture out with the economy reopening and Covid-19 cases on the decline, we still expect e-commerce players to hold their own given the convenience, wide selection, and low prices.
Within our theme, eBay (EBAY) stock has been the strongest performer, rising by about 48% year-to-date, driven by stronger demand growth and also due to its lower valuation multiples which have helped it capitalize on the broader rotation from high-growth to value stocks over the last few months. On the other side, FedEx (FDX) has been the weakest performer, with its stock down by about 12% year-to-date as rising labor costs have hurt its profitability.
While e-commerce players are gaining at the expense of brick and mortar retailers, check out our theme of Fintech Stocks for a list of companies that could potentially disrupt the $1.5 trillion-plus U.S. insurance and financial services industry.
[8/9/2021] E-Commerce Stocks Look Attractive Following Post Earnings Sell-Off
Our theme of E-Commerce Stocks – which is comprised of U.S.-based e-commerce companies as well as logistics, and payment players, has declined by about 7% over the last month, compared to the S&P 500 which rose 1.5% over the same period. While second-quarter earnings turned out stronger than expected for most e-commerce companies that have reported results, mixed Q3 guidance and expectations of slowing growth post the Covid-19 lockdowns appear to have hurt sentiment for the fast-growing sector. For instance, e-commerce bellwether Amazon saw revenue growth slow to 27% year-over-year in Q2 201, down from about 44% in Q1, while noting that growth could slow further in Q3 to about 13.5%, based on the mid-point of guidance.
That being said, we think the recent decline presents an opportunity to enter the sector. Covid-19 cases in the U.S. are on the rise once again, driven by the spread of the highly infectious Delta variant of the virus. The seven-day average infection rate in the U.S. has risen from 22,000 in early July to over 100,000 cases presently. This could delay the re-opening of workplaces and keep people at home for a few more quarters, helping e-commerce stocks in the near term. Moreover, while there was already a secular shift to online shopping prior to Covid-19, the pandemic is likely to accelerate this trend, given the changes in consumer behavior through months of lockdowns, helping these stocks in the longer run.
[7/8/2021] Why E-Commerce Stocks Are Still A Buy
Our theme of E-Commerce Stocks – which is comprised of U.S.-based e-commerce companies as well as logistics, and payment players – is up by 25% year-to-date, outperforming the broader Nasdaq-100 which is up by about 17% over the same period. The gains come despite the fact that the brick and mortar retail is opening up following Covid-19, with over half of U.S. adults now vaccinated and Covid cases on the decline. Now, e-commerce was gaining share from physical retail prior to Covid, and investors are likely betting that the pandemic is only likely to bolster the shift to online shopping, given the changes in consumer behavior through months of lockdowns. For example, research firm eMarketer estimates that U.S. retail e-commerce sales will grow by 13.7% this year and by 15% next year, with consumers expected to spend over $1 trillion via digital retail channels in 2022.
Within our theme, eBay (EBAY) stock has been the strongest performer, rising by about 39% year-to-date, driven by stronger demand growth and also due to its lower valuation multiples which have helped it capitalize on the broader rotation from high-growth to value stocks over the last few months. On the other side, Etsy (ETSY) a platform focused on handmade products, vintage items, and craft supplies, has been the worst performer within our theme, with its stock gaining just about 8%, amid weaker earnings guidance, as it faces a tough comparison with a solid pandemic year.
[4/6/2021] Will The Third Stimulus Check Help E-Commerce Stocks?
Our theme of E-Commerce Stocks – which includes U.S-based e-commerce platform players as well as logistics, and digital payment companies – is up by about 14% year-to-date, compared to the S&P 500 which is up by about 9% over the same period. The theme is also up by a solid 151% since the end of 2019, compared to a 26% return on the S&P 500. While investors have been rotating out of software and other high-growth stocks as the economy continues to open up following Covid-19, most e-commerce names in our theme have held up as investors likely expect e-commerce to continue eating into retail sales even post the pandemic. Moreover, it’s likely that a sizeable amount of the stimulus checks being mailed out as part of the $1.9 trillion Covid-19 rescue package will flow toward digital commerce spending, helping these companies. Within our theme, Wayfair (NYSE:W) a company that sells furniture and home goods online, has been the strongest performer with its stock up by about 43% year-to-date. On the other side, e-commerce bellwether Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has underperformed with its stock remaining roughly flat year-to-date.
[3/18/2021] E-Commerce Stocks To Watch
Our theme of E-Commerce Stocks includes U.S-based e-commerce platform players, logistics, and digital payment companies that stand to gain as shopping continues to move online. The e-commerce market has expanded significantly over the last year as the Covid-19 pandemic accelerated the shift away from brick and mortar stores to digital shopping, not just for discretionary items but also necessities. For perspective,  e-commerce as a percentage of overall U.S. retail sales jumped from around 16% in 2019 to almost 21% in 2020. [1] There’s a lot more room for the market to grow, considering that the total U.S. retail market stood at about $4 trillion in 2020. Our theme has outperformed the broader markets significantly, returning about 151% since the end of 2019, versus about 23% for the S&P 500. The theme is also up 11% year-to-date, compared to about 6% for the S&P 500. Below is a bit more about some of the companies in our theme and how they have fared.
Etsy (ETSY) an e-commerce platform that focuses on handmade products, vintage items, and craft supplies had a solid run through the pandemic, as gross merchandise sales, active buyers, and sellers on its platform soared. We think the company should continue to do well post the pandemic, as it could become the go-to platform for unique items that may not be available locally. The stock is up by about 388% since the end of 2019.
Wayfair (W), an e-commerce company that sells furniture and home goods, benefited from the trends of sheltering at home – which raised the demand for home improvement and the growing shift to e-commerce. The company is also building a very loyal base of customers, with more than two-thirds of its orders over its last quarter coming from repeat customers. The stock has gained a solid 248% since the end of 2019.
Carvana (CVNA) is an online used car retailer. Demand for used cars soared through Covid-19, as people look to avoid public transport. Moreover, customers shifted to e-commerce for buying cars as they remained averse to traditional in-person buys. The stock is up by about 208% since the end of 2019.
PayPal Holdings (PYPL) operates a worldwide online payments system that supports online money transfers. The stock has gained about 130% since the end of 2019, as people have preferred digital payment mediums through the Covid pandemic. Moreover, the company’s move to allow users to buy, sell, and hold select Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin on its app has also helped its stock.
FedEx (FDX) stock is up by about 72% since the end of 2019. Although the company has seen some headwinds in recent years, as major customer Amazon doubled down on investments into its own logistics operations, the Covid-19 pandemic caused e-commerce shipments by the company to pick up. E-commerce should remain a tailwind, with the company expecting e-commerce package deliveries to more than triple to 111 million per day by 2026, up from about 35 million in 2019.
Amazon (AMZN), the e-commerce pioneer, saw demand for both its cloud computing business – Amazon Web Services – and its core online retail business soar through the pandemic, with revenue jumping by a solid 38% last year to about $386 billion. Amazon stock is up by about 67% since the end of 2019.

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.

2021-10-19 00:00:00+00:00,An Impressive Tech Pedigree Could Make This SPAC a Huge Winner,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/an-impressive-tech-pedigree-could-make-this-spac-a-huge-winner-2021-10-19,,,"Investing in initial public offerings (IPOs) is a relatively straightforward, if somewhat risky proposition. Investors dig in to the regulatory documents -- typically the S-1 filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission -- to determine the financial performance, customer metrics, and business prospects of a company before its debut to determine if it meets their threshold for investment.
A special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) is a very different animal. The sponsor company goes public first and later acquires a promising business with the funds raised. Investors have no idea what company will eventually be acquired and are therefore relying entirely on the SPAC's management team, or sponsors, to pick an acquisition target that will ultimately be successful. For that reason investors must have a high degree of confidence in the team running the SPAC.
That's what makes MELI Kaszek Pioneer (NASDAQ: MEKA) so intriguing.
Image source: Getty Images.
A dream team of tech innovators
MELI Kaszek Pioneer (hereafter referred to as MEKA) has strong ties to a company that has been wildly successful, in no small part because of its tech-savvy and forward-looking management team.
Investors are no doubt familiar with MercadoLibre (NASDAQ: MELI), the undisputed e-commerce leader and digital payments powerhouse in Latin America. Its ability to navigate the unique business, economic, and political climate in the region has led to explosive gains for shareholders, with the stock surging more than 5,300% since its debut in mid-2007.
MEKA brings together Kaszek, the largest early-stage venture capital firm in Latin America, and MercadoLibre as co-sponsors, but its lineage runs deeper, tapping some of ""the original founding team from MercadoLibre as sponsors,"" according to its press release. This group of entrepreneurs reads like a Latin American who's who of disruption and innovation.
Hernan Kazah is co-CEO of MEKA and managing partner at Kaszek. Not only that, but Kazah was one of the co-founders of MercadoLibre, acting as the company's chief operating officer for nine years and CFO for another three.
Pedro Arnt is the other co-CEO at MEKA and has been with MercadoLibre since the beginning, initially as vice president of marketing and sales before being promoted to CFO in 2011, a position he has held ever since.
A review of MercadoLibre's history helps illustrate why its management team is so well suited to disrupt the SPAC space as well.
Disruption at its core
MercadoLibre was the brainchild of CEO Marcos Galperin, who co-founded the e-commerce company back in 1999. It was initially modeled after eBay, which eventually bought a 19.5% stake in MercadoLibre and mentored the company after it was unable to gain ground in the region.
Additionally, Latin America was -- and remains -- largely a cash-based society, which was a significant hurdle for the budding e-commerce company. Undeterred, MercadoLibre developed Mercado Pago, a digital payment system inspired by PayPal. Adding a twist based on local practices, Mercado Pago partnered with a string of local convenience stores, allowing consumers to add money to their account.
While Mercado Pago was originally linked solely to the MercadoLibre platform, it became so successful that it made the jump to brick-and-mortar retail, ushering in a new phase of its growth.

MercadoLibre also met the threat from Amazon by developing a shipping solution that tapped the most reliable shippers in each of the 18 countries where it operates. This resulted in volume discounts for its merchants, who in turn can offer free or discounted shipping to their respective customers.
These innovations have helped MercadoLibre become Latin America's leading e-commerce and fintech company.
Disrupting the SPAC
MEKA isn't content to merely find a company to acquire and take public, but instead plans on improving on the traditional SPAC with several features that should bode well for long-term investors.
One departure from the traditional SPAC is MEKA's decision to opt for a ""warrantless SPAC."" Warrants allow early investors to buy shares at a later date at a pre-determined price. Unfortunately, this typically requires the issuing of new shares in exchange for the warrants, which dilutes existing shareholders. Instead, MEKA will receive at least $50 million in private investment in public equity (PIPE) funds via a forward purchase agreement with MercadoLibre and Kaszek.
MEKA is signaling to investors that its management team is in for the long haul by adopting a longer than customary lock-up period -- which restricts insiders and early investors from selling shares for a period of time after the SPAC merger is completed. The usual lock-up lasts roughly six months. MEKA is opting for an 18-month lock-up, unless certain performance thresholds are achieved.
SPAC sponsors historically have the most to win from the transaction, earning a hefty 25% of the shares sold in the IPO. MEKA has added a performance-based structure to its SPAC, which only vests for the sponsors if the SPAC generates returns for investors.
Finally, rather than simply bringing a company public and then cutting ties, MercadoLibre and Kaszek plan to offer mentoring and business assistance, as well as potential operational partnerships with the target company.
A winning combination
The traditional SPAC is typically little more than a crapshoot, with investors betting that some unknown visionary will make the right acquisition choice that will ultimately result in future gains.
Given the tech pedigree of MEKA's sponsors, their history of innovation and disruption, and the investor-friendly features they're bringing to this transaction, there's a much higher degree of certainty that investors will ultimately win when MEKA finds an acquisition target.

2021-10-19 00:00:00+00:00,This Company Has Nearly Doubled Since Its March IPO. Is It a Buy?,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/this-company-has-nearly-doubled-since-its-march-ipo.-is-it-a-buy-2021-10-19,,,"Shares of SEMrush Holdings (NYSE: SEMR) -- the online visibility management tool -- jumped 150% from its March IPO by September, before falling back to 100% appreciation today. Other than IPO hype, there has not been any reason for this jump.
The irrationality of this share-price appreciation has left some investors wondering if this software-as-a-service company still has growth ahead of it. Even though it has a market capitalization of just $3 billion, the valuation of 20 times sales worries investors, but its leading solution could provide plenty of growth for the business in the future.

The importance of search engine optimization
SEMrush's goal is to improve the visibility of its customers online. As people spend more time on their phones and on the internet, they can be overwhelmed with the amount of information and advertising they receive, which can lead to some people blocking this information out. This can lead to difficulties for companies looking to break through the noise and abundance of information online to be visible to their target market.
SEMrush provides an all-in-one solution for companies to find key insights that allow them to advertise their products efficiently. Its comprehensive solution allows for its customers to advertise on social media, but also employs search engine optimization (SEO) to take a long-term approach to their advertising strategies. While SEMrush's competitors like Moz and Similarweb (NYSE: SMWB) focus on one part of a company's advertising strategy, SEMrush offers a broad range of options to its customers.
SEMrush offers an unbiased view of its immense data assets -- which include over 20 million domains, 20 billion keywords, and analysis on 1 billion events each day. Unlike Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) or Facebook (NYSE: FB), which are incentivized to promote their own advertising channels, SEMrush provides an unbiased, customized view on the best advertising options for its customers.
Thanks to this comprehensive analysis solution, combined with its vast data sets and unbiased view, the company has become a market leader in numerous marketing technology categories from search advertising to social media management. This leadership has allowed the company to attract many impressive customers including Walt Disney (NYSE: DIS), Salesforce (NYSE: CRM), and eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY). These customers have also expressed how valuable SEMrush is to their advertising strategies: In Q2 2021, SEMrsuh's net revenue retention was 121%, and its average revenue per user increased 19% from the year-ago quarter.
The implications of leading an industry
SEMrush's 76,000 customers in over 142 countries have helped the company reach impressive financial performance. Even as a top dog in the industry, the company saw 58% year-over-year revenue growth in Q2 2021, to $45 million. The company has been building on its 50 offering by launching a Keyword Difficulty solution that enables its customers to optimize their SEO marketing efforts.
For the full year, the company expects revenue to reach $183 million, which would mark 47% growth from 2020. The only downside for SEMrush is its profitability. Even after 13 years of operations, the company lost $279,000 in Q2 2021. This was, however, a strong improvement from a net loss of over $2 million one year ago. Free cash flow stands at $9 million so far this year, and with cash balance of over $180 million, a minor net loss is not a dealbreaker for the company.
What about 10 years from now?
Aside from valuation risk -- which is higher than Similarweb's valuation of 12 times sales -- the company is facing heavy competition. While its analytics platform isn't as unbiased as SEMrush's, Google and Facebook are heavy hitters in this industry, and companies only looking to advertise on those two sites might overlook SEMrush. There's also plenty of competition from smaller pure plays in each respective marketing technology category, and while SEMrush is a leader in many of those spaces, it could potentially lose out to competitors that focus on one specific advertising category.
What many companies want, however, is an all-in-one solution. Many of SEMrush's enterprise customers are not looking to advertise through one avenue, but through many, and SEMrush provides enterprises with one platform where they can analyze data for all of those advertising strategies.
SEMrush's vast data assets and comprehensive solution -- which has been shown to be very valuable and successful to have -- are unmatched by its competitors. It's also extremely important to its enterprise customers who are looking for actionable data and insight to make effective marketing decisions.
With a current market opportunity of over $13 billion, this company clearly has tons of potential to expand, and with its unique, hard-to-replicate solution, SEMrush is well-positioned to capitalize on it. Because of this, SEMrush is still worth buying today, even though it has already seen strong share-price growth.

Brian Withers: I look at MercadoLibre's history, and they have, over time, have quietly bought a bunch of small tuck-in acquisitions across logistics, across marketplace platforms, and across tech companies where they look at maybe a tech company who's building fintech tools or payment services or e-commerce operations and starts to work with them on specific projects, outsources a specific project, and they like what they see, they try and buy, and then they bought a number of these over the years.
They've really built up a very strong tech-focused backbone across MercadoLibre, so I feel like they're very good at finding tech companies and certainly that meet their mission, and I think that's what they're looking for. But so really pleased bringing MercadoLibre to the show, and it took a SPAC to bring them, well, so be it. But I know you're a shareholder or want to be a shareholder.
Matt Frankel: I am.
Withers: OK, so what's your favorite part of the MercadoLibre ecosystem of tools and products?
Frankel: Not the SPAC. I would have to say it's Mercado Pago. Not only is it the fastest-growing part of their business, I think it has, it's like the PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL) and eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY) dynamics. Whereas PayPal started out as like a subsidiary of eBay, was the other way you paid for your eBay purchases, gradually started to move into other forms of payment. It used to be weird to use PayPal for anything other than eBay. I don't know if you remember that, I certainly do.
Now, no one even thinks about eBay when you say the name PayPal. I see this as an earlier-stage PayPal. But if it was a subsidiary of Amazon, not eBay. But can you imagine if PayPal had its outside-of-eBay dominance that it does right now, while still getting virtually 100% of Amazon's payments to process? I could see it growing into something like that in the Latin American market. I don't see them spinning it off anytime soon as another difference. They might, down the road, but I don't see it anytime soon. That's definitely the most exciting part of the business in my mind.
Withers: Yeah, I did a bit on Mercado Pago and MercadoLibre yesterday, I think, and the number that sticks in my head is $10 billion worth of off-payment platform payments, last quarter, just last quarter. Yeah, so that's exciting part of the business for sure.
Frankel: PayPal does about 30 times that just for context.

*Stock Advisor returns as of September 17, 2021
Parkev Tatevosian: Ebay has been one of the companies that benefited during the pandemic as people jumped online and were avoiding stores at the initial onset at least. Now revenue for Q3 is expected to decline to 2.465 percent a 5.8 percent decrease. However, the reason for the decline is there's also some divestitures. Excluding the divestitures the revenue is actually going to increase about eight percent. It's not a real apples-to-apples comparison to last year. Then earnings-per-share is expected to come in at 0.89 cents per share, about a 4.7 percent increase. A few things to watch here is the active buyer totals. At the pandemic onset, right in their second quarter of last year, eBay added a record total of seven million new active buyers. Now some of those buyers are leaving. At the end of Q2, eBay had a 159 million total active buyers. That's down two percent from last year. But if you compare it to 2019, that was still up about three percent from 2019, so it's going to be interesting to watch how it evolves in the next quarter. Can they stabilized those active buyer losses? There's also another trend that we can double-click on in the buyer, increases and decreases later if you would like to, Brian. Then the next point is to watch gross merchandise volume. This is important for eBay. This is essentially the total dollar value of transactions that take place on eBay's platform. That's important because eBay earns its revenue by taking a percentage of those transactions. In other words, that's their take rate. The revenue divided by gross merchandise value is the take rate. In its second quarter eBay was able to increase revenue despite the gross merchandise value decreasing. They did that by increasing the take rate substantially. It actually increased by about 200 basis points from last year. It'll be interesting to see if it can continue raising that take rate and what upper ranges on that take rate for eBay. Then finally, it will be interesting to watch if eBay's getting any tailwinds from resellers joining eBay. What I mean by that is supply chain shortages, and shortages of gaming chips and new gaming consoles and games and all things you've seen sold out and out-of-stock at major retailers or something I like to always say when I'm writing about eBay is that eBay is rarely ever sold out. For the most part, you can find what you're looking for on eBay. Now you may have to pay higher than retail price, 20, 30, 40 percent higher but you could usually find what you're looking for on eBay. As these out-of-stocks and sold out things increase in retailers, eBay should get a tailwind from that on their site.
Brian Withers: You hit the nail on the head is what I think of when I think of eBay, it's my e-commerce site of last resort. [laughs] Unfortunately, that's what eBay's become known for. I know that they've been able to move past that. I know that they've done a few acquisitions over the years. One of them being a sport-centric apparel and trinket maker. But eBay always seems second tier to the Amazon's (NASDAQ: AMZN) of the world, even something like Etsy (NASDAQ: ETSY), who's formed a nice niche around themselves by focusing on artisans and having a more creative marketplace. Do you feel like eBay has to have a solid quarter or can they just continue to make marginal improvements and have shareholders be happy?
Parkev Tatevosian: That's good question. I think that the bar is lower for eBay because investors are expecting a decrease from the pandemic surge that they went through last year. So I don't think that they need to do extremely well in this quarter. I do think that they need to continue to execute on their initiatives, building out. For example, I mentioned that they were able to increase the take rate by about 200 basis points. That's partly a result of migrating the buyers and sellers on the site over to their own payment system. That's been a nice source of incremental revenue. That's going to add 1.8 billion in revenue this fiscal year for eBay. Those revenues come at about a contribution margin of 25 percent. That was about 80 percent transitioned over. They're expecting that to increase to about 90 percent in the third quarter. As long as they continue executing on that initiative and then focusing more on higher-value buyers, I think the investors will continue to reward them.
Brian Withers: Very cool. I was looking at the five-year. If you look back at the five-year history for eBay, it's doubled in the last five years. Nice around 15 percent return versus the market, which is about a 55 percent over that same time period. It absolutely is quietly beating the market behind the scenes. Maybe one for Motley Fool members to take a look at.

LONDON, Oct 14 (Reuters) - It was an email offering a discount on an electric toothbrush that began the sequence of events that ruined Anna's life.
Within minutes of entering her card details, she got a call from her bank telling her fraudulent transactions were being made. The next day Robert Clayton from Britain's Financial Conduct Authority called to say they were pursuing the criminals responsible but that her savings were at risk.
There was no toothbrush, though. No fraud department, no Robert Clayton. They were all part of a scam to gradually siphon off Anna's life savings, and within a few weeks the plot had succeeded, to the tune of about 200,000 pounds ($270,000).
""I am still in shock, the guilt and shame are impossible to convey,"" said the 78-year-old widower from central England, who did not want her full name to be used in this story.
She is one of thousands of people who have seen savings swept away this year by an unprecedented wave of online bank fraud hitting Britain, where you're more likely to be a victim of online fraud than any other crime.
The country is the global epicentre for such attacks, according to five of the biggest British banks and more than a dozen security experts who said scammers were buying up batches of consumers' personal details on the dark net to target the record numbers shopping and banking online since the pandemic.
The country's super-fast payments infrastructure, relatively light policing of fraud-related crime, plus its use of the world's most widely used language English, also made it an ideal global test bed for scams, the banks and specialists added.
A British record of 754 million pounds ($1 billion)was stolen in the first six months of this year, up 30% from the same period in 2020, according to data from banking industry body UK Finance, and up more than 60% from 2017, when it began compiling the figures.
That represents a per capita fraud rate roughly triple that seen in the United States in 2020, according to a Reuters calculation from UK Finance and the latest available Federal Trade Commission data.
""The most sophisticated fraud tends to start in the UK, and then move two years later to the U.S. and then around the world,"" said Ayelet Biger-Levin, vice president of product strategy at U.S.-based cybersecurity firm BioCatch, which provides anti-fraud technology to banks.
""In the last 12 months we have seen more fraud attacks than we had seen in any other year in history. Data breaches have also accelerated, so there's a lot more personal information out there that criminals can take advantage of.""
'MONEY WOULD HAVE SUPPORTED US'
Unlike simple email-based scams of the past purporting to be from princes or oil barons seeking your help to shift their millions, the modern bank scam can be sophisticated, multi-phased and extremely convincing.
""We've seen some cases where the fraudster has been talking to somebody for three or four years as someone else before they actually scam them out of a large amount of money,"" said Brian Dilley, group director for economic crime prevention at Britain's biggest bank Lloyds.
Deena Karia, another scam victim, told Reuters how she lost 10,000 pounds in early February after buying a seemingly safe bond purportedly issued by Credit Suisse and apparently listed on price-comparison site MoneySuperMarket.
After filling out a form on the website and receiving a call from a staff member there, she called them back on the number listed on the website to check the phone number was legitimate, made further checks about the bond and went on to invest.
Karia, from outer London, still does not know exactly how her money was stolen, but believes the scammers may have created a fake website mimicking MoneySuperMarket.
The genuine MoneySuperMarket warned on Feb. 15 of crooks faking its website and impersonating its staff. A spokesperson for the company said it is working to take down such fake websites and phone numbers, working with the FCA to highlight cloned websites and reporting issues to the police.
""I lost my Dad not long ago, I'm caring for my mother and that money would have supported us for years,"" Karia said.
Barclays, her bank, has refunded only half the money, saying she could have done more to protect herself.
""We have every sympathy with Miss Karia who was the victim of an investment scam and as the case is currently being investigated by the Financial Ombudsman Service, we await the conclusion of their review,"" Barclays said.
FAST PAYMENTS, FAST FRAUD?
The government's National Economic Crime Centre (NECC) agrees with the banking sector's assessment that fraud represents a threat to British security.
""It is growing from an already enormous scale,"" said Chris Reed, fraud threat lead at NECC, which he said was meeting at least every month with bank bosses, technology executives and telecoms companies to assess and respond to threats.
Britain's Faster Payments' network, which allows transfers between bank accounts to settle instantly rather than in hours or days as in the United States and other developed banking markets, means criminals can rapidly spirit away funds.
""The faster payment system has facilitated faster fraud,"" said Richard Emery, a fraud expert who is advising Anna and 63 other scam victims whose average loss is 102,000 pounds.
Pay.UK, which runs the network, said the system supported the British economy, consumers and businesses. It added that criminals were getting better at exploiting digitisation and that it was working with the industry and regulator to fight fraud.
While security experts and senior bankers said many fraud attacks could be traced overseas - including from India and West Africa - Britain is also increasingly exporting attacks.
Crimes such as authorised push payments (APP) – where people are tricked into authorising a payment by a criminal posing as their bank or other trusted company – are proliferating globally after having started off as a largely UK phenomenon.
The country ranks second in the world behind the United States as a source of automated bot attacks, the fastest-growing type of fraud attack in the world, according to data from LexisNexis Risk Solutions, a financial crime analysis firm.
Bot attacks see criminals use a high volume of stolen identity credentials to overrun a website, allowing them to set up new accounts or access existing ones.
""It's popular to say the fraud threat is imported into the UK, and I don't think that bears analysis,"" said NECC's Reed. ""There is a significant UK nexus to a lot of fraud, our operational experience is showing that.""
HSBC: UK IS HOTBED OF FRAUD
Britain's banks - which often pick up the compensation bill when people are scammed - are trying to respond.
HSBC, which has operations in the Americas and Asia, has hired more than 300 staff in a year to support its anti-fraud operations in its home market and increased annual spending by 40% to deal with an ""exponential"" number of customers affected, the bank told Reuters.
""The UK is the hotbed of activity for fraudsters. Currently the UK accounts for about 80% of our global personal fraud losses,"" it said.
Lloyds said it had invested 100 million pounds in its defences over the past two years, while rival NatWest has 10% of its workforce - amounting to 6,000 people - dedicated to combating financial crime. TSB has hired 100 extra staff to support fraud victims in the last year.
But lenders are also pressing the government to make social media platforms, where they say some attacks originate, share the burden. British lawmakers told bosses at Facebook, Google, Amazon and eBay last month that they needed to do more combat fraud.
The NECC's Reed said another problem was that just 1% of policing resources were dedicated to fighting fraud, despite it making up over a third of all crime in England and Wales.
""I won't hide away from the fact that resourcing of the response is completely out of step with the scale and seriousness of the threat. We've got a mountain to climb.""
This means that criminals are emboldened to target people like Anna, who has little hope of recovering her savings.
The fraudsters had told her to shift her ""at risk"" cash to an account on a cryptocurrency platform that they emptied - while isolating her from family by stressing secrecy and coaching her on how to respond to sceptical bank officials.
""They knew the name of my financial adviser, they were utterly convincing as FCA staff,"" she said. ""And they told me I could not tell anyone about the investigation as it would damage their efforts to catch the crooks.""

2021-10-12 00:00:00+00:00,Will Amazon's Stock Continue To Soar Above Peers?,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/will-amazons-stock-continue-to-soar-above-peers-2021-10-12,,,"We think that Amazon’s stock (NASDAQ: AMZN) currently is a better pick compared to Walmart’s stock (NYSE: WMT). Amazon’s stock trades at about 3.9x trailing revenues, compared to around 0.7x for Walmart. Does this gap in the companies’ valuations make sense? We believe so. Both the companies have seen revenue growth over the last three years with Amazon growing at a much higher pace. With respect to operating margins Walmart saw higher growth over the last three years compared to Amazon. However, there is more to the comparison, which makes Amazon a better bet than Walmart at these valuations. Let’s step back to look at the fuller picture of the relative valuation of the two companies by looking at historical revenue growth as well as operating income and operating margin growth. Our dashboard Amazon vs Walmart: Industry Peers; Which Stock Is A Better Bet? has more details on this. Parts of the analysis are summarized below.
1. Amazon Clear Winner On Revenue Growth
With Walmart’s fiscal year ending in January, its ongoing FY is 2022 while Amazon’s is 2021. If compared on the basis of the past three years, Amazon trumps Walmart in revenue growth. Amazon’s revenue was recorded at $443.3 billion in the last twelve months period compared to $232.9 billion in FY 2018 (a jump of 90%). On a comparable basis, Walmart’s revenue was recorded at $562.8 billion in the last twelve months period compared to $514.4 billion in FY 2019 (a rise of 9%). Further, for the most recent quarter (Q2’21 for Amazon and Q2’22 for Walmart), Amazon’s revenues jumped 27% YoY, while Walmart’s grew by 2.7%.
Due to the faster revenue growth of Amazon, it holds an advantage over Walmart as it is catching up quite fast with Walmart’s revenue base. This makes Amazon’s revenue growth impressive and hence makes it a better bet.
2. Amazon Edges out On Margins
Amazon’s EBIT margin was 6.7% in the last twelve month period compared to 3.7% for Walmart. Over the last three years operating margin for Amazon has risen by 0.6% compared to a 1.4% rise by Walmart. Though Walmart saw a better improvement Amazon holds the edge due to a higher margin, which coupled with Amazon’s higher revenue growth, gives it the edge.
Risk
Amazon has a better debt position, with debt as % of equity of 3% vs 11% for Walmart. Amazon has more cash cushion, with cash as % of assets of 25% vs 9.7% for Walmart.
The Net of It All
While Amazon’s trailing revenue multiple stands higher than that of Walmart, it has seen stellar growth in revenues over the last three years and has a higher operating margin compared to Walmart in the same period. Looking at the post-Covid growth, overall Amazon has fared better than Walmart. Over the last twelve months Amazon’s revenue growth was at 38% while Walmart’s revenue grew by 5.3%. Amazon also held the edge in EBIT margin which was 6.7% in the last twelve month period compared to 3.7% for Walmart. With regards to risk, Amazon has a lower debt-equity ratio and a higher cash-to-assets ratio than Walmart. Hence we believe Amazon has the potential to keep riding ahead, supported by strong financials and the gap in valuation could further widen over time. As such, we believe that Amazon is currently a better buying opportunity compared to Walmart stock.

2021-10-08 00:00:00+00:00,Could eBay's Business Be Better than Before the Pandemic?,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/could-ebays-business-be-better-than-before-the-pandemic-2021-10-08,,,"eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY) is one company that benefited from the shift to online shopping at the pandemic's onset. Folks who wanted to avoid shopping in person chose to go online for their essential needs and other items.
However, that initial boost is fading away as economies reopen and folks are less fearful about leaving their homes. Still, some benefits from 2020 could prove long-lasting, and eBay may emerge in a better position than before the outbreak.
Buyers flocked to eBay as they avoided shopping in person. Image source: Getty Images.
Higher-quality buyers
As its fiscal second quarter ended June 30, eBay had 159 million total active buyers. Even though this is down 2% from last year, it is still 3% higher than the same quarter in 2019. So far, it looks like some buyers who came to eBay during the pandemic are going to stick around as economies reopen.
Interestingly, the mix of buyers is also of higher strategic value to eBay. The company is transitioning from legacy tactics used to attract buyers that were resulting in low-value buyers. For instance, I have stopped receiving coupons for 20% off my entire purchase from eBay; these used to arrive to my inbox roughly once every quarter. Instead, management has focused on attracting high-value buyers. Here is CFO Steve Priest discussing how the company defines a high-value buyer:
These include buyers who sell, or buyers who purchase at least six days a year and spend over $800. This high-value segment represents approximately 20% of our buyer base, and they purchase around 75% of our GMV [gross merchandise volume]. High-value buyers grew in Q2 as did the spend per buyer. Low-value buyers on eBay make approximately half of our buyer base, but only purchase about 5% of our GMV.
So not only does eBay have 3% more buyers than in 2019, but its buyer base also likely consists of folks who make more purchases or spend more each time they purchase -- or both.
eBay transitions its payment system
Management is also migrating eBay's buyer and seller base to its payment system. In the fiscal second quarter, 71% of payments were managed through eBay's system, and it's well on its way to over 90% in the third quarter. The new system helps sellers by reducing the number of unpaid items, a scenario where a customer clicks to buy the item but never makes the payment.
In addition, the new system will add to eBay's profitability. The company expects total dollar volume of payments processed to reach $1.8 billion this fiscal year.
Improved profit margin
Importantly, eBay has long been a company that operates with healthy profit margins. Indeed, over the past decade, it has averaged an income before-tax percentage of 28.3%. And management expects profits to expand this fiscal year, telling investors that it expects to improve its operating profit margin by 150 basis points from 2019.
Overall, the changes management has implemented have put eBay in a better position than before the pandemic. Moreover, the stock is trading at a favorable forward price-to-earnings ratio of 17.5. For those reasons, investors can feel good about adding eBay stock to their watch lists.

2021-10-08 00:00:00+00:00,Why This Pick-and-Shovel Cannabis Stock Says Its Shares Are Too Cheap,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-this-pick-and-shovel-cannabis-stock-says-its-shares-are-too-cheap-2021-10-08,,,"During the third-quarter earnings call for Scotts Miracle-Gro (NYSE: SMG), CEO Jim Hagedorn not-so-subtly gave his opinion on the stock's price, saying, ""I'm a big fan of buying our shares at these prices."" While it is not uncommon to hear CEOs say this about their companies, Hagedorn may not simply be talking up his company's stock in this case.
With most of a $750 million share-repurchase authorization available, the company is eyeing its shares at a discounted price. But should investors consider buying, too?
Image source: Getty Images.
Scotts Miracle-Gro and its buy(back) thesis
Operating in the lawn and garden and hydroponic gardening markets, Scotts is a highly seasonal company, receiving 75% of its revenue in the second and third quarters. Aided by the pandemic and increased at-home spending, the company posted monstrous results for these quarters in 2020, leaving very tough comparables to meet this year. As the company lapped these comparables in 2021, the market was unimpressed, sending shares down by over 40% from their 52-week high.
However, despite the market's reaction, Scotts was able to grow revenue by 8% year over year for the third quarter and even grew earnings per share by 12% over the same time frame. Thanks to this seeming divergence between the company's growth and its stock performance, Hagedorn expanded upon his opinion of the company's share price, saying, ""I'm comfortable allocating upwards of $250 million to share repurchase in the months ahead under our existing authorization, so look for us to do that.""
At its current price, $250 million in buybacks equates to 3% of the company's shares outstanding and offers intriguing potential to investors as Scotts has seen its P/E ratio plummet to 15, compared to the S&P 500's average P/E of 31. In lieu of paying a special dividend, share buybacks can lower a company's total share count if done correctly and can be a great way to return cash to shareholders, especially if its share price begins to recover over time.
Hawthorne's explosive, hidden growth
Operating as a pick-and-shovel play to the marijuana industry, Hawthorne, Scotts' indoor and hydroponic gardening segment, might represent the most compelling argument for an investment in the company. After growing sales 48% year over year during the third quarter, despite tough comparables, Hawthorne now represents 26% of the company's overall sales.
Scotts' rapidly growing segment has positioned itself beautifully to continue benefitting from the ongoing legalization of marijuana; it offers the lighting, nutrients, and growing media necessary to produce it effectively. As the company continues to bring new bolt-on acquisitions into the fold, it aims to improve the segment's overall profitability through its Project Catalyst initiative, a ""company-wide restructuring effort to reduce operating costs"". In addition, this initiative is expected to create ""synergies from acquisitions within the Hawthorne segment"".
With Hawthorne generating a profit margin of just 12% compared to the U.S. consumer (outdoor and lawn) segment's margin of 26%, this initiative could drive profitability for the indoor gardening and hydroponic segment. Ultimately, management is guiding for Hawthorne to finish the year with 40%-plus growth, which is in addition to its 60% growth rate from last year.
Scotts Miracle-Gro is the best of both worlds
Thanks to the low growth and high margins from Scotts' core U.S. consumer segment, and the high growth and low margins in its Hawthorne segment, the company's overall valuation appears quite muddied. But the two distinct business lines fit together nicely, as the cash generation from its core segment helps fuel the growth for Hawthorne. In a way, this is reminiscent of a steadily growing eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY) before the spinoff of its high-growth PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL) unit and perhaps foreshadows the potential success of an investment in Scotts Miracle-Gro at today's discounted price.
While a spinoff of Scotts' Hawthorne segment is probably not imminent, the company's current P/E of 14 paired with the fledgling segment's potential has me in agreement with CEO Hagedorn and his bullish view on the stock.

Here are brief introductions to five contenders you might consider for your portfolio. With $25,000, you might park $5,000 in each, but you can choose just one or two, and you can, of course, invest less if you don't have $25,000 burning a hole in your pocket.
1. Datadog
Datadog (NASDAQ: DDOG) offers companies a cloud-based monitoring and security platform. Its stock has been on a tear in its short time on the public markets, more than tripling in value in about two years -- with an average annual growth rate of nearly 90%.
The stock is popping because the company is. In its second quarter, revenue grew 67% year over year to $234 million, while its number of larger customers generating $100,000 or more in annual recurring revenue rose 59%. Datadog has partnerships in place with some rather sizable and prominent tech businesses, too, such as Microsoft and Salesforce.com, and it keeps adding to its offerings, making for a ""sticky"" environment that many customers won't want to leave.
2. Palo Alto Networks
Palo Alto Networks (NYSE: PANW) is a global leader in cybersecurity, something few individuals or companies would want to be without these days. The company's stock has surged roughly ninefold over the past nine years, averaging an annual return of about 27%. (For some context, the S&P 500 averaged closer to 15% over the same period, which is still far above average.) Palo Alto's future looks bright, too.
In its recent fiscal year-end presentation, the company noted that it more than doubled the number of major product releases between fiscal 2019 and 2021, with 29 of them in 2021. In its impressive fourth quarter, revenue was up 28% year over year and total billings rose 34%. In the fourth quarter conference call, chair and CEO Nikesh Arora noted:
As a company, we've continued to focus on getting more presence in our customers and getting larger deals with them. I'm delighted to say, we had 18 customers sign transactions over $10 million in the quarter. We had our first customer that surpassed $100 million in their booked business during the fiscal year as they standardized for Palo Alto Networks across the entire enterprise. And our Millionaire customers were up to 986 in Q4, approximately up 30% for the third quarter in a row.
3. PayPal Holdings
PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ: PYPL) may need little introduction, but many people don't appreciate what a big business it is -- with a recent market value topping $300 billion. That's partly due to the fact that PayPal is more than just PayPal. It also encompasses other services, such as the popular payment app Venmo. As of its second quarter, it had 403 million active accounts, and 4.7 billion payment transactions, with a total payment volume of $311 billion.
PayPal's stock has soared more than 600% since the summer of 2015, when it was spun off by eBay, representing an average annual growth rate of about 37%. The company does face meaningful competition, such as from the likes of Square, but it's still a fintech leader, with plenty of growth likely ahead. Its customer engagement, for one thing, has been accelerating, with the number of transactions increasing.

4. Atlassian
Atlassian (NASDAQ: TEAM) specializes in collaboration and productivity software, and recently boasted more than 200,000 customers. The company's fourth-quarter letter to shareholders bragged: ""We generated $560 million in revenue, up 30% year-over-year, and achieved subscription revenue growth of 50% year-over-year. We added over 23,000 net new customers and the pace of cloud migrations continues to build, increasing more than 2x year-over-year.""
Shares of Atlassian have been trading on the public market since late 2015, and since then they have surged more than 1,700%, enough to turn a $10,000 investment into more than $180,000. (That's an average annual growth rate of nearly 65%, by the way.) As the company grows via new product development and acquisitions, its future looks rosy.
5. Shopify
Shopify (NASDAQ: SHOP) may not be a household name, but it's well known in the business world, having achieved a market value recently near $170 billion by offering a popular e-commerce platform. In its second quarter, the company posted year-over-year revenue growth of 57%, with its subscriptions solutions revenue surging 70%, in large part thanks to new customers. The company's monthly recurring revenue (investors love to see recurring revenue, as it's generally predictable) rose 67%.
There's a lot of growth going on at Shopify, and it shows when you look at how its stock has performed in recent years: Shopify shares have been well shopped by investors, advancing nearly an eye-popping 8,000% since only mid-2015. That's an average annual growth rate of about 99%, enough to turn a $10,000 investment into more than $800,000.
That's enough to have some investors wondering whether the stock has gotten way ahead of itself. Many, though, especially long-term investors, see plenty of growth ahead -- and possibly a trillion-dollar market value.
There are no guarantees in the stock market, but these growth stocks seem quite promising. If you can imagine them valued much higher in the future, consider buying in. If you're not convinced they're attractively priced right now, perhaps just add them to your watch list or buy into them incrementally over time.

Today, PayPal has a market cap of just over $300 billion.
PayPal's annual revenue grew from $9.24 billion in 2015 to $21.45 billion in 2020, as its number of active accounts rose from 179 million to 377 million. It ended the second quarter of 2021 with 403 million active accounts, and it expects its revenue to rise about 20% to $25.75 billion for the full year.
PayPal clearly flourished after the spinoff, even as it lost eBay to its Dutch rival Adyen and faced aggressive fintech challengers like Square. But will PayPal's growth streak continue, pushing its valuation toward the trillion-dollar mark by 2025?
Image source: PayPal.
PayPal's growth targets for 2025
PayPal set some ambitious targets at its latest investor day this February. By 2025, it expects to nearly double its active accounts to 750 million, and more than double its annual revenue to over $50 billion. It expects its earnings to rise at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 22% between 2020 and 2025, and for its annual free cash flow to double from $5 billion to over $10 billion.
PayPal expects the growing acceptance of NFC and QR code payments, along with the expansion of its platform with additional financial services, to drive that growth.
Its new ""super app"" -- which bundles together mobile messages, a digital wallet, peer-to-peer payments, bill payments, direct deposits, cryptocurrency services, shopping tools, buy now, pay later features, and more -- sets up the foundations for that expansion. It also recently partnered with Synchrony Financial to add a high-yield savings account, PayPal Savings, to that ecosystem.
Those moves will all make it easier to launch additional features, including free stock trades and other investment services, which would help it keep pace with Square's Cash App and Robinhood.
Can PayPal really double its revenue by 2025?
The global digital payments market could grow at a CAGR of 14.2% between 2020 and 2025, according to Markets and Markets.
PayPal's annual revenue would need to grow at a CAGR of 18.4% between 2020 and 2025 to hit $50 billion, so it likely expects to grow its revenue at a slightly faster pace than the broader market.
That's a pretty optimistic projection, since PayPal's annual revenue already grew at a CAGR of 18.5% between 2015 and 2020. It's only expecting a slight deceleration from those previous five years, even as it faces much tougher competition from Square, Adyen, and other growing fintech rivals.
I believe it will be challenging, but certainly not impossible, for PayPal to generate $50 billion in annual revenue by 2025. Until then, investors should keep tabs on PayPal's ability to expand its fintech ecosystem, as well as its competitors' shifting strategies, to see if it can fulfill those promises.
Could PayPal's stock more than triple by 2025?
For PayPal to join the trillion-dollar club by 2025, its stock would need to more than triple within the next four years. That could be a high bar to clear: PayPal's stock has already risen more than 600% since its spinoff from eBay, and it currently trades at 45 times forward earnings and 12 times this year's sales.
If PayPal maintains those valuations and hits its long-term EPS growth targets, its stock could be trading in the low $470s by the beginning of 2025. Assuming its share count stays roughly the same, the company would be worth about $560 billion.
PayPal constantly repurchases its own shares, but most of those buybacks are used to offset its dilution from stock-based compensation. Since its spinoff, PayPal only reduced its share count by less than 3% -- so additional buybacks probably won't tighten up its valuations by 2025.
Therefore, the only way PayPal's market cap might hit $1 trillion by 2025 is if investors are willing to pay a much higher multiple of about 80 times forward earnings. The likelihood of that happening is fairly low, even if PayPal's adjusted earnings grow at a CAGR of 22% between 2020 to 2025.
Look beyond the market caps
PayPal's stock probably won't triple over the next four years and turn it into a trillion-dollar company. However, it should continue generating robust growth as people use less cash and rely more on mobile payment apps for both digital payments and investments. Therefore, PayPal is still a solid long-term investment in the booming fintech market, and it should remain an attractive option for investors who think companies like Adyen, Square, and Robinhood are too hot to handle.

2021-10-03 00:00:00+00:00,Coupang Is Near Its All-Time Low; Is It Time to Buy?,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/coupang-is-near-its-all-time-low-is-it-time-to-buy-2021-10-03,,,"South Korean e-commerce business Coupang (NYSE: CPNG) has seen spectacular growth, but despite its dominance, the stock is near its all-time lows. The company has expansion opportunities ahead, but it will have to jump over some steep hurdles to get achieve its international goals.
Its low valuation and potential growth areas make Coupang an investment that carries plenty of risks, but if it is successful, it could reward shareholders handsomely over the next five years.
Image source: Getty Images
Its dominance in South Korea
Since its founding in 2010, Coupang has become the largest product e-commerce company in South Korea. Because 70% of its customers are within just seven miles of one of the company's logistic centers and it has a delivery fleet of over 15,000 full-time drivers, Coupang has been able to standardize same-day delivery or next-day delivery. One-hundred percent of orders are delivered within the next day or sooner. It even has Dawn Delivery, where orders placed before midnight are delivered by seven in the morning the next day, which blows Amazon's two-day Prime delivery out of the water.
The speed of delivery and subsequent customer satisfaction has allowed the company to increase its revenues by 50% for 12 consecutive quarters to $4.5 billion, which grew 71% year over year in the second quarter of 2021. The company increased its customer base to over 17,000 in the second quarter (representing 36% growth) while increasing net revenue per customer from $194 to $263 year over year.
The company is still gaining prominence in South Korea, even though it is already a leading e-commerce player. This leadership position could allow it to grow alongside the country's e-commerce market as a whole, which is expected to grow 10% annually from $128 billion in 2019 to $206 billion by 2024. Achieving $15.7 billion in trailing 12-month sales, Coupang currently holds just 10% of Korea's 2021 e-commerce market share. The e-commerce market is very fragmented; Coupang and eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY) each control 10% of the market. The difference between Coupang and eBay, however, is that Coupang is growing much faster than eBay, which grew its revenue by just 2% year over year in its recent quarter.
The company is not profitable, and the margin profile for the business isn't pretty. Gross margin in the second quarter of 2021 was just 15%, and the company spent 178% -- over $1.1 billion -- of gross profit on operating expenses. Coupang reported a net loss of $813.6 million over the first six months of 2021, but nearly $300 million of that came from expenses due to a warehouse fire. Excluding that, the company still had a net loss of $530 million, and its free cash flow was negative $183 million -- even after taking out fire-related expenses.
Why the drop?
On the day it started trading in March, shares jumped 81% to $63.50, but since then shares have fallen steadily to the high $20 range. What may be bringing shares down is the fact that the company reported 74% and 71% revenue growth for the first quarter and second quarter of the year. While 70% growth is great for any company, it is slower than the 90% growth it saw in each quarter of 2020.
Because of its price decline and strong revenue growth, the company's valuation has gotten very appealing: At the beginning of April, the company was trading at 6.8 times 2020 sales, and now it is trading at just 2.6 times trailing 12-month sales.
This valuation is especially attractive for a company that is a market leader in Asia. Compared to Sea Limited -- which trades at 25 times trailing 12-month sales -- Coupang offers a much lower price for a market leader in a quickly growing geography.
Where does Coupang go from here?
Coupang's low valuation also might be due to skepticism about how much growth is ahead. While there is good market growth in South Korea, that alone will not allow Coupang to maintain 70% growth. Rather, investors want it to expand internationally.
Coupang has alluded to plans to expand into Singapore and Japan. Ihe company will face stiff competition in both regions, namely from Sea Limited in Singapore and Amazon in Japan. Sea Limited has a strong grip on Singapore and the rest of Southeast Asia, so much so that it has been able to expand and see strong success across the ocean in Brazil -- all while maintaining dominance on its home turf. Amazon and Rakuten controlled a combined 38% of e-commerce sales in 2020 in Japan, so fighting for prominence there will be a difficult task as well.
While Coupang's customer service and speed are unmatched, the company will have to face tough competitors if it wants to continue its strong growth. Investors should watch its performance in Singapore and Japan, and if it can gain market share there, then the company could see strong, sustained growth for many years. Right now, international success is still up in the air, and until Coupang can prove itself outside of South Korea, investors might want to watch and wait before buying up shares.

See the 10 stocks
*Stock Advisor returns as of September 17, 2021
Matt Frankel: It's PayPal, ticker symbol PYPL. Listen to some of these statistics when I talk about PayPal, $1.2 trillion, trillion with a T of annualized payment volume. Their total payment volume is up 40% year-over-year, 40% for a business that's doing over $1 trillion of annualized volume.
Jason Hall: That's a business that's been around for two decades.
Frankel: Remember when they were just a little part of eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY). That's just how you paid for eBay purchases.
Hall: That's back before we knew who Elon Musk was.
Frankel: Right. They're a profitable business.
Hall: Yeah.
Frankel: They generated $1.1 billion in free cash flow last quarter, they're expecting over $5 billion for the year. They've been doing some really impressive bolt-on acquisitions. They don't have to dilute shareholders or go into debt to do. They're making money, they can do that. There you go. They acquired Honey the discount shopping app last year. I think they paid five billion for that. They just paid for that out of their cash. They recently acquired a Japanese buy now, pay later service called Paidy for $2.7 billion. PayPal and Square (NYSE: SQ), the two either people always compare very close to each other. I love how PayPal is tackling the buy now, pay later space.
Hall: Yeah.
Frankel: They built their own and they're doing bolt-on acquisitions. They built their own buy now, pay later platform to the point where it did $1.5 billion in Q2 alone. It financed purchases for over four million customers last quarter, and now they're adding strategically throughout the world. Paidy is the Japanese leader in buy now, pay later, so now that comes on to PayPal's ecosystem. I really like how they attempt acquisition strategy.
I think Honey was a great acquisition which will turn out to be worth a whole lot more than the five billion or so they paid for it. I think Paidy will end up adding nice incremental value to that buy now, pay later business. If buy now, pay later doesn't turn out to be the big red hot market that everyone thinks it is right now, they're spending $2.7 billion acquiring Paidy, not the 29 billion Square's paying for Afterpay.
Hall: This is the place that you want to see a company make acquisition that doesn't work well.
Frankel: I mean, why did I rank this number seven (of eight)? Probably because I see limited upside potential from this point. If anything. Market cap is over $300 billion already, I mentioned over a trillion dollars of payment volume. Now, to be fair, cashless payment volume around the world is estimated at $185 trillion. They're not going to get all of it. PayPal could easily double or triple their payment volume over the next few years, something like that. But compared to some of the other FinTechs on the list I just see limited upside potential from here. That's really why it got my numbers seven spot.
Hall: Exact same for me. I mean, it trades for about 13 times sales. It's a wonderful business and it's still growing. But it just seems to me that paying that premium for businesses already that large, I think, it's a bit of a stretch for me.

Earlier this week, Blue Prism became the latest British takeover target by a private equity firm, a trend driven by cheap UK valuations following Brexit and the pandemic.
In a letter to the software firm's board, Coast Capital said it would encourage other shareholders to reject Vista's 1,125 pence-per-share offer, saying the bid undervalues the London-listed firm.
""The proposed transaction leads shareholders to question the board's clear conflict of interest in unanimously supporting a transaction which values the company materially below consensus valuation, 52-week high, and its average price since IPO...,"" Coast Capital, which owns about 3 million Blue Prism shares, said in the letter.
Blue Prism, whose customers include automaker Daimler DAIGn.DE, e-commerce firm eBay EBAY.O and Britain's NHS, had said it plans to recommend that shareholders vote in favour of the Vista bid, calling the terms ""fair and reasonable"".
Vista and Blue Prism did not immediately respond to a Reuters query.

2021-09-30 00:00:00+00:00,3 Reasons Amazon Should Consider Spinning Off AWS,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-reasons-amazon-should-consider-spinning-off-aws-2021-09-30,,,"Ever since Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) started breaking out Amazon Web Services' (AWS) revenue and operating profits in 2015, a growing number of analysts have called for the tech giant to spin off the expanding cloud business.
As a longtime Amazon investor, I've repeatedly opposed that idea, for a simple reason. AWS generates higher-margin revenue than Amazon's retail business, so it actually drives most of Amazon's profit growth, while supporting the expansion of its retail ecosystem with deep discounts, cheap hardware devices, brick-and-mortar stores, and other loss-leading strategies.
But over the past year, I've gradually warmed up to the idea of Amazon spinning off AWS. Let's take a look at three reasons Amazon should consider a spin-off -- and whether or not it could actually happen.
Image source: Getty Images.
1. Amazon has a hidden growth engine
Amazon is actually the third-largest online advertising platform in the U.S. after Alphabet's (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google and Facebook (NASDAQ: FB), according to eMarketer, but it hasn't started to break out its advertising revenue or operating profits separately yet.
Instead, Amazon's advertising business accounts for the lion's share of its ""others"" segment, which grew its revenue 82% year over year to $14.8 billion in the first half of 2021 and accounted for 7% of Amazon's top line. By comparison, AWS' revenue increased 35% year over year to $28.3 billion in the first half of 2021 and accounted for 13% of Amazon's top line.
Amazon doesn't break out the ""others"" segment's operating profits yet, but market-leading advertising platforms usually generate higher-margin revenue than cloud infrastructure platforms.
For example, Facebook -- which generates nearly all of its revenue from ads -- ended last quarter with an operating margin of 43%. AWS, the only major public cloud infrastructure platform that generates consistent profits, ended last quarter with an operating margin of 28%.
Therefore, Amazon's advertising business likely operates at higher margins than AWS, and it's generating much stronger sales growth. Meanwhile, AWS faces intense competition from Microsoft's (NASDAQ: MSFT) Azure and Google Cloud, and it could be forced to match their recent price cuts for their third-party cloud marketplace fees (3% for both platforms, compared to AWS' 5%).
Based on these facts, it makes sense for Amazon to spin off AWS while it's still growing and rely more on its booming advertising business for its future earnings growth.
2. It could appease the antitrust regulators
AWS gives Amazon a killer advantage against most other retailers, since its higher-margin revenue supports the expansion of its Prime ecosystem with lower-margin strategies. That's why many big brick-and-mortar retailers prefer to use Microsoft's Azure or Google Cloud instead of supporting the growth of Amazon's biggest profit engine.
Amazon also faces constant pressure from antitrust regulators in the U.S. and overseas regarding the dominance of its e-commerce marketplaces. AWS, which Canalys estimates controls 31% of the global cloud infrastructure market, is also being scrutinized by regulators, and it could face probes if more retailers complain about the profit-generating synergies between Amazon's retail business and AWS.
Proactively spinning off AWS might appease the regulators, make AWS more appealing for Amazon's retail competitors, and give Amazon more breathing room to expand its advertising business.
3. AWS wouldn't need to support the retail business anymore
AWS supports Amazon's profit growth, but Amazon's retail business is also preventing AWS from achieving its true growth potential. Spinning off AWS would enable the cloud company to invest in its own future growth without the burden of supporting Amazon's lower-margin marketplaces and stores.
That separation would be comparable to eBay's (NASDAQ: EBAY) spin-off of PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL) in 2015. In that divestment, each eBay shareholder received one new share of PayPal for each eBay share they owned. Here's what happened to both stocks after the split:
Source: YCharts.
That spin-off unlocked PayPal's growth potential as a stand-alone company, and investors who kept their shares of both companies have netted big multibagger gains in just over six years. We could see Amazon and AWS generate similar gains as separate companies in just a few years.
But will a spin-off ever happen?
Amazon CEO Andy Jassy, who previously led AWS before succeeding Jeff Bezos in July, previously rejected calls to spin off AWS. However, a spin-off makes more sense every quarter as Amazon's advertising business expands and the company faces more antitrust headwinds. Therefore, I still believe Amazon could still spin off AWS in the near future -- and investors should applaud the move.

2021-09-30 00:00:00+00:00,2 Cathie Wood Growth Stocks to Buy and Hold for 10 Years,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/2-cathie-wood-growth-stocks-to-buy-and-hold-for-10-years-2021-09-30,,,"One of the keys to successful investing is holding shares of great companies for five or more years. And if you're looking for excellent stocks to own, it might be worth getting some inspiration from one of the most recognizable names in the investing world right now: Cathie Wood, founder and CEO of ARK Invest.
Wood's actively managed, exchange-traded funds feature some great buy-and-hold stocks. Two I'd like to talk about today are Teladoc Health (NYSE: TDOC) and PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL). Let's see why both of these growth stocks are worth considering for your portfolio.
TDOC data by YCharts
1. Teladoc
Healthcare stock Teladoc has fallen on hard times lately. Shares of the company are down about 35% since the beginning of the year. We can attribute this decline in part to the market shifting away from high-growth, premium-priced stocks. But for investors focused on the long game, Teladoc remains a great option thanks to its leadership in the telemedicine industry.
Teladoc offers patients some traditional healthcare services (such as consultations, prescriptions, and referrals) from the comfort of their homes, 24 hours a day, and seven days a week. While the pandemic helped increase the adoption of telehealth services, they are now clearly here to stay. In a nationwide poll of 1,800 patients last year by Doctor.com, 83% said they would turn to telemedicine after the pandemic.
Teladoc already serves some notable clients, including more than 50% of Fortune 500 companies.
Image source: Getty Images.
One of the company's appeals is its vast network of more than 50,000 clinicians and 450 subspecialties. Teladoc is building a competitive edge known as the network effect. As its network of healthcare professionals grows, its platform becomes more attractive to potential customers, leading more clinicians to join the network. Expect Teladoc's total visits and top line to continue growing.
The company sees a $250 billion market opportunity in the U.S. alone. Teladoc's revenue for the second quarter ended June 30 came in at $503.1 million, more than double what it did in the year-ago period. If the company manages to capture even a fraction of its addressable market, it will likely more than triple its annual revenue within the next decade.
That's why this healthcare stock is worth considering as a long-term holding for the next 10 years.
2. PayPal Holdings
Digital payments pioneer PayPal first grew in stature thanks to its association with eBay. The company earned tremendous name recognition while serving as the go-to payment method for customers on the e-commerce platform.
PayPal split from its former parent company back in 2014 -- and seven years later, it continues to make solid headway in the fintech industry. During the second quarter, PayPal's total active accounts grew by 16% year over year to 403 million while its total payment volume -- or total value of transactions conducted on PayPal's platform -- jumped by 36% year over year to $311 billion.
The digital payment industry is ripe for growth. According to one estimate, it could be valued at $236 billion in 2028 (in terms of total revenue), up from $58.3 billion in 2020. PayPal's revenue during the second quarter came in at $6.2 billion, 17% higher than the year-ago period but still just a fraction of the potential market size ahead.
Image source: Getty Images.
The company is adapting to current trends to profit from this opportunity. For instance, its peer-to-peer payment app Venmo has graduated to something much more than that. It now accommodates retail transactions and offers a debit card and the ability to buy and sell cryptocurrency, among other perks. The crypto world has been on fire recently, and this initiative is sure to increase engagement on Venmo.
The company also recently announced the acquisition of Japanese ""buy now, pay later"" (BNPL) company Paidy in a cash transaction valued at $2.7 billion. The deal is set to close in the fourth quarter of 2021. BNPL allows customers to pay for goods or services on credit without a credit card. Consumers pay the money back in installments, typically free of interest. It has seen a surge in demand of late. PayPal attributes this rising demand to the uncertain economic conditions we are experiencing. With the acquisition of Paidy, PayPal is positioning itself to make some waves in this market.
PayPal sees a $110 trillion addressable market ahead for the range of services it offers. The company needs only to capture a small fraction of that for it to continue posting stellar financial results and outperform the broader market in the long run. In short, PayPal is an outstanding stock to buy and forget.
Think long term
Even the best companies have their ups and downs. Both Teladoc and PayPal have encountered headwinds in recent months -- but given both companies' prospects, this represents an excellent opportunity to purchase their shares at a discount. I believe investors who decide to pull the trigger today will be glad they did so down the road.

2021-09-25 00:00:00+00:00,3 NFT Stocks With High Growth Potential,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-nft-stocks-with-high-growth-potential-2021-09-25,,,"The market for non-fungible tokens -- digital assets like art, video clips, or music that ownership identified in the blockchain -- came to life in 2021, despite some ups and downs. Three months ago, monthly sales volume of NFTs was checking in at $59.2 million. Today, that number has reached $2.6 billion, according to trading site NonFungible.


As dollars and cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum flow into NFTs, companies are trying to figure out how to capitalize. Sports leagues and players are dropping (or creating) NFTs and artists and performers are getting in on the action. So, how can investors play in the market without betting on single NFTs themselves? DraftKings (NASDAQ: DKNG), Cloudflare (NYSE: NET), and eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY) are great places to start.

DraftKings
DraftKings has launched an NFT marketplace, primarily for athlete-related NFTs. The company has become a top name in sports gambling, so transitioning to NFTs could be a natural fit.
Sports cards have long been a way to buy sports-related collectibles and DraftKings seems to be viewing NFTs in the same way. Current NFT drops look a lot like sports cards with a little more exclusivity and greater ease of trading. And if young collectors are getting into buying NFTs rather than cards, this could be a great move for DraftKings because it's selling NFTs from athletes like Tom Brady, Wayne Gretzky, and more.
DraftKings' system will run on Ethereum Layer 2, which is a scaling solution to handle the increased transition load on the Ethereum network, and by the end of the year the company expects its NFTs to be transferrable to external digital wallets. If sports NFTs take off, DraftKings could be a winner in the market.
Cloudflare
Cloudflare, a cloud services provider that secures and enhances the performance of the internet, is an infrastructure play in NFTs. The company's Cloudflare Stream allows video creators to tie content to NFTs, saying it allows ""creators to embed their NFT claim to ownership into their video on Cloudflare Stream."" The idea is to limit access to a video to those who hold an NFT.
What I like about Cloudflare is that it's looking for ways to make NFTs a useful digital asset. There are myriad potential uses for NFTs beyond just selling JPEGs, so if companies start writing contracts with NFTs or tie physical asset ownership to NFTs this could be a big market. Videos could be a foot in the door to more assets and NFT structures.
Cloudflare is a great way to invest in NFTs' growing infrastructure needs. Given the company's history of innovation on the edge of the cloud, this could be a big winner long-term.
EBay
One of the original internet marketplaces, eBay, is also taking its crack at NFTs. The company allows the sale of some NFTs on its traditional online platform but that may just be the start if it opens up to cryptocurrencies and other digital assets.
EBay is taking a bit of a different approach to NFTs from some of its rivals. The company is still focused on dollar sales right now, rather than relyng on a cryptocurrency, which is used in most NFT transactions on OpenSea. Accepting standard currency could make an eBay NFT more accessible to the masses than a cryptocurrency-focused NFT platform.
A legacy company like eBay may not be an ideal place for disruptive NFT sales off the bat, but as we see the cryptocurrency market go through wild volatility there may be a a need for some kind of stabilizing force. EBay could be a natural buyer, and a highly liquid one, especially if the crypto and NFT market goes through a big panic.
NFTs are here to stay
I don't think the ride for investors will be easy, but NFTs probably are here to stay. Digital goods have been growing in popularity for years and I think that will only continue as the use of digital platforms for communication and productivity increases. Not every company will win in a world of NFTs, but DraftKings, Cloudflare, and eBay have a good shot at building a niche in the NFT market.
