2021-12-23 00:00:00+00:00,Will Inflation Hurt Dollar Stores?,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/will-inflation-hurt-dollar-stores,,,"It's no secret that the cost of everyday goods is way up. These days, consumers are paying more at the pump, supermarket, and just about everywhere.
In November, the Consumer Price Index recorded a 6.8% jump in the cost of goods compared to the previous year. And with supply chain issues still running rampant, there's a good chance high levels of inflation will persist well into the new year.
That's already having an impact on dollar stores. Though these stores have managed to thrive during the pandemic at a time when other retailers have experienced declines in revenue, the higher cost of procuring goods is making discount stores rethink their strategy.

Dollar stores no more?
Dollar Tree (NASDAQ: DLTR) recently announced a shift in its pricing model -- one that its customers may not be thrilled about. Beginning in the first quarter of 2022, most of the chain's $1 items will increase in cost to $1.25.
Sticking to its strict $1 price point has hampered Dollar Tree, the company reports, and forced it to remove popular products from its inventory line. The retail chain's hope is that raising its price point will allow it to bring back customer favorites and expand its product line.
Increasing its price point might also enable Dollar Tree to better absorb the higher cost of procuring inventory -- a byproduct of recent supply chain bottlenecks that many retailers are grappling with. And let's not forget there's a massive labor shortage that's impacting retail on a whole. By raising price points, Dollar Tree could put itself in a better position to raise wages -- and attract workers at a time when labor is so difficult to come by.
A strategic move or a sorry one?
Dollar Tree has stuck to its $1 price point for 35 years. Now the company is looking to not only raise its primary price point to $1.25 but also add $3 and $5 items to more of its stores in select locations.
But whether this change helps Dollar Tree or hurts it is yet to be determined. On the one hand, customers might appreciate a wider range of inventory and accept the $1.25 price point as a sign of the times. On the other hand, customers might balk at the idea of paying more than $1 for items across the board -- especially at a time when other dollar store chains aren't universally raising their prices.
Dollar General (NYSE: DG), for example, does offer some items at a higher price point than $1. But it hasn't announced plans to shift its primary $1 price point upward.
It has, however, expanded its Popshelf line, which offers higher-end goods around the $5 mark. The key difference, though, is that Popshelf is expressly designed to target a different audience than the typical Dollar General customer, whereas Dollar Tree's price hikes won't achieve that goal. If anything, what they might do is put the chain at risk of losing customers to competitors.
Will dollar stores lose their edge?
Budget-conscious shoppers have long flocked to dollar stores to stretch their income further. And in the wake of the pandemic -- a time in which many households experienced their share of financial upheaval -- many consumers have become even more motivated to keep their spending to a minimum.
But if dollar stores continue to raise prices to combat inflation and the other challenges they're facing, like supply chain holdups and hiring struggles, they could end up driving customers away. Consumers who shop at dollar stores not due to financial constraints but due to their desire to snag bargains may instead opt to seek out sales at regular-priced stores rather than take their chances at dollar stores, where inventory can be hit or miss.
Of course, if raising price points ends up hurting dollar stores, it could put their expansion plans on hold. Dollar General, for example, is aiming to open 1,000 Popshelf locations by the end of fiscal 2025. But if customers start ditching dollar stores, those plans could be paused.
That would, in turn, be a blow to real estate investors. Many retailers have shuttered locations in the course of the pandemic, leaving shopping centers and malls with vacancies to deal with. The hope right now is that dollar stores will come in and fill some of those gaps. But if dollar stores lose their appeal, it could put shopping centers and malls in a very precarious position.

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.

2021-12-19 00:00:00+00:00,"Dollar Tree, Inc. (NASDAQ:DLTR) Shares Could Be 25% Below Their Intrinsic Value Estimate",DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/dollar-tree-inc.-nasdaq%3Adltr-shares-could-be-25-below-their-intrinsic-value-estimate,,,"Today we will run through one way of estimating the intrinsic value of Dollar Tree, Inc. (NASDAQ:DLTR) by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.
We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model.
The model
We are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.
Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:
10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate
2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031
Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$786.2m US$1.20b US$1.33b US$1.53b US$1.73b US$1.87b US$1.99b US$2.08b US$2.17b US$2.24b
Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x6 Analyst x7 Analyst x6 Analyst x3 Analyst x2 Est @ 8.16% Est @ 6.3% Est @ 5% Est @ 4.09% Est @ 3.45%
Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.3% US$740 US$1.1k US$1.1k US$1.2k US$1.3k US$1.3k US$1.3k US$1.3k US$1.3k US$1.2k
(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)
Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$12b
The second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.3%.
Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2031 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$2.2b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (6.3%– 2.0%) = US$53b
Present Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$53b÷ ( 1 + 6.3%)10= US$29b
The total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$41b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$136, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 25% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.
NasdaqGS:DLTR Discounted Cash Flow December 19th 2021
Important assumptions
We would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Dollar Tree as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.3%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.981. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.
Looking Ahead:
Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value?

2021-12-17 00:00:00+00:00,First Week of August 2022 Options Trading For Dollar Tree (DLTR),DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/first-week-of-august-2022-options-trading-for-dollar-tree-dltr,,,"Investors in Dollar Tree Inc (Symbol: DLTR) saw new options begin trading this week, for the August 2022 expiration. One of the key inputs that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 245 days until expiration the newly trading contracts represent a potential opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the DLTR options chain for the new August 2022 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $135.00 strike price has a current bid of $14.45. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $135.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $120.55 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of DLTR, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $136.57/share today.
Because the $135.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 58%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 10.70% return on the cash commitment, or 15.95% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Dollar Tree Inc, and highlighting in green where the $135.00 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $140.00 strike price has a current bid of $14.50. If an investor was to purchase shares of DLTR stock at the current price level of $136.57/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $140.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 13.13% if the stock gets called away at the August 2022 expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if DLTR shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Dollar Tree Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing DLTR's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $140.00 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $140.00 strike represents an approximate 3% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 47%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 10.62% boost of extra return to the investor, or 15.82% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.
The implied volatility in the put contract example, as well as the call contract example, are both approximately 36%.
Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $136.57) to be 36%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

2021-12-16 00:00:00+00:00,ContextLogic Is Only a Buy at $2 if Changes Are Made,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/contextlogic-is-only-a-buy-at-%242-if-changes-are-made,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
I’m not a fan of ContextLogic (NASDAQ:WISH). I’ve continually recommended readers remain skeptical about WISH stock. As for my $2 recommendation, that came in August as a last-resort suggestion:
“If you bought WISH stock in the teens, you better hope and pray that this logistics pivot works. If it doesn’t, I could see the stock going to $2 or lower in no time.”
Source: sdx15 / Shutterstock.com
At the time, WISH was trading around $7,116% higher than its current price of $3.24 and a 78% decrease from its 52-week high of $32.85 from February. If you bought at the highs, I sure hope you sold for a loss a long time ago. 
The way things are going, WISH could trade at $2 before Christmas. If it does, here’s what you need to know before placing what should be considered a very speculative bet.
WISH Stock and Its Logistics Play
InvestorPlace’s Alex Sirois recently discussed ContextLogic’s state of affairs. He described the company’s third-quarter 2021 results as woefully inadequate and nowhere near enough to suggest the company’s turnaround efforts are working.
7 Dividend Stocks to Buy for 2022 With Dividend Yields Over 5%
I continue to focus my attention on ContextLogic’s logistics revenue. That’s where the business has a fighting chance of survival. As I wrote on Oct. 6:
“As it moves more of its revenue to its end-to-end logistics offerings — which typically aren’t nearly as profitable as apparel e-commerce — it will have to severely cut back its sales and marketing if it wants to make money. Until the company breaks out its expense structure for its logistics business versus its marketplace business, I’m not sure how any informed investor can make a reasonable decision about ContextLogic.”
Let’s take a closer look at its Q3 2021 10-Q.  In the third quarter, the company’s logistics revenue was $148 million, about 3% less than in Q3 2020. For the first nine months of fiscal year 2021, ending on Sep. 30, it had logistics revenue of $621 million, about 100% higher than in the same period in 2020. 
So, the one shining light in an otherwise abysmal business model also appears to be slowing. That’s not good. No wonder company founder and CEO, Piotr Szulczewski, is stepping down. 
As I said in early October, ContextLogic has two businesses — e-commerce and logistics — neither of which are fully mature. That said, things are a mess at WISH. It needs a Christmas miracle to recover from where it currently sits as a business.
What About Profits?
As I said in my last article, it would be nice if the company broke out its logistics expenses. However, the word “logistics” is mentioned 21 times in its 10-Q and just three times in its Q3 2021 press release. 
In a 180-degree turn, the company’s press release suggests focusing on its e-commerce platform and moving away from a shift to logistics. 
“The foundation of that plan is to improve and maintain trust with our buyers, and to provide a differentiated and engaging buying experience. In doing so, we expect to drive long-term growth and sustainable unit economics for our eCommerce platform,” stated Executive Chair Jacqueline Reses. “By redoubling our focus on our most frequent buyers, we’re learning what features and products are most likely to catalyze our entire user base to engage and buy on Wish.”
She expects the company’s e-commerce platform to return to growth in the second half of 2022. 
Translation: the company is asking you to trust them for at least seven or eight months until it can report Q2 2022 e-commerce growth. 
That’s a big ask for a stock down from its highs and around 86% from its December 2020 IPO price.    
In December, PYMNTS.com suggested that a combination of poor demographics, lots of red ink, and an over-reliance on Chinese products made it a losing proposition. Unfortunately, that analysis has turned out to be right on the money.
In nine months, ContextLogic’s seen its cash on its balance sheet fall by $910 million. That’s money it can never get back. On a per-share basis, it’s $1.42, or almost 43% of its current share price. 
Can you say value destruction?
Would I Still Buy at $2?
The only thing that would get me to buy WISH stock at $2 is if it manages to hire someone that has more than a passing knowledge of e-commerce retail. 
While the Executive Chair has served on the board of Alibaba (NYSE:BABA), that doesn’t mean she’s got what it takes operationally to lead ContextLogic out of the hole it’s in. 
As Pymnts.com pointed out in December, WISH is basically an online dollar store. So if it can hire a senior executive from Dollar General (NYSE:DG), Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR), or Dollarama (OTCMKTS:DLMAF), I would revisit my negative outlook on its business. 
At $3.24, its share price is still too high.

Meanwhile, some investors have their eyes trained on Wednesday, when the Federal Open Market Committee will announce its latest policy decisions. While most expect the benchmark Fed funds rate to stand pat, some believe the central bank will accelerate the timeline for tapering its $120 billion-per-month asset-purchasing program.
Michael Reinking, senior market strategist for the New York Stock Exchange, also pointed investors in the direction of the New York Fed's survey of Consumer Expectations. Near-term (one-year) inflation expectations increased to 6.0% in November from 5.7% in October, but three-year expectations actually declined to 4.0% from 4.2%, the first time that had happened since June.

""This is something the Fed will continue to watch as they continue to highlight that they want inflation expectations anchored around 2%,"" Reinking says. ""While this is clearly above that level it is positive to see this tick lower though a single data point a trend does not make (spoken in my best Yoda impersonation).""

BOSTON, Dec 12 (Reuters) - Dollar Tree DLTR.O said on Sunday it offered to explore a settlement with Mantle Ridge and hand a board seat to a former chief executive of a rival retailer, saying the activist investment firm's decision to seek control of its board is ""unwarrantedly aggressive.""
Dollar Tree is reacting publicly to Mantle Ridge's decision late on Friday to nominate 11 directors and replace the entire board as well as push the company to hire Richard Dreiling, a former CEO of Dollar General Corp DG.N.
The company said it reached out to the investment firm, which owns 5.7% of its common stock, with suggestions on how to overhaul the board. It was ready to add Dreiling as a board member and possibly also as a consultant.
Mantle Ridge would also have been given a say in selecting another board member, Dollar Tree said.
But Mantle Ridge failed to respond to the suggestions, the company said, noting it ""never heard back from Mantle Ridge until it received the letter nominating its slate to replace the entire Board.""
Mantle Ridge, run by Paul Hilal who honed his credentials as an activist investor at William Ackman's Pershing Square Capital Management, said in Friday's filing that the company would benefit from a refreshed board.
Dollar Tree on Sunday countered that Mantle Ridge, which traditionally invests in only one company at a time and has successfully pushed for changes at railroad CSX and food services company Aramark, came with no plan or new ideas.
Hilal and Mantle Ridge simply proposed changes in the board and executive ranks and wanted Dreiling to be appointed executive chairman, Dollar Tree said. ""The breadth and depth of the changes you suggest would be very disruptive and value destructive,"" Dollar Tree wrote in a letter to Hilal that it made public on Sunday.
A representative for Mantle Ridge did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Dollar Tree said it is still ready to engage constructively with Mantle Ridge but warned that ""handing control of the company"" to Hilal and Mantle Ridge is not in the best interest of Dollar Tree, its shareholders or other stakeholders.

Dollar Tree said that on December 2, its board met in person for several hours with Paul Hilal, Richard Dreiling and three other Mantle Ridge representatives.
Dollar Tree alleged that at the meeting, Mantle Ridge offered no new ideas for how to improve the company's performance or operations. The only operational suggestion made - that the company should sell Dollar Tree merchandise at Family Dollar stores - is something Dollar Tree has already been doing for several years.
Instead, Mantle Ridge simply expressed that it wanted a majority of the Board to be replaced, Dreiling to be named Executive Chairman, and other control rights. Taken together, in the view of the Board, these demands amounted to handing control of the Company to Hilal and Mantle Ridge.
After deliberating on that meeting, the Dollar Tree board sent a letter to Mantle Ridge it offered to explore a settlement in which Dreiling would be added to the Dollar Tree Board and also offered Mantle Ridge a role in the company's ongoing Board refreshment program. Continuing Mantle Ridge's pattern, the company never heard back from Mantle Ridge until it received the letter nominating its slate to replace the entire Board.
However, Dollar Tree said its board stands ready to engage constructively with Mantle Ridge, even though it is disappointed that, rather than pursuing constructive engagement, Mantle Ridge has chosen to embark on an unwarranted and potentially disruptive proxy contest to replace the entire Board.

2021-12-10 00:00:00+00:00,ANALYSIS-Shipping costs - another danger for inflation-watchers to navigate,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/analysis-shipping-costs-another-danger-for-inflation-watchers-to-navigate,,,"By Sujata Rao and Jonathan Saul
LONDON, Dec 10 (Reuters) - Much like the coronavirus pandemic, and the economic disruption that it has caused, a global shipping crisis looks set to go on delaying goods traffic and fuelling inflation well into 2023.
Shipping rarely figures in economists' inflation and GDP calculations, and companies tend to fret more about raw materials and labour costs than transportation. But that might be changing.
The cost of shipping a 40-foot container (FEU) unit has eased some 15% from record highs above $11,000 touched in September, according to the Freightos FBX index. But before the pandemic, the same container cost just $1,300.
With 90% of the world's merchandise shipped by sea, it risks exacerbating global inflation that is already proving more troublesome than anticipated.
Peter Sand, chief analyst at the freight rate benchmarking platform Xeneta, does not expect container shipping costs to normalise before 2023.
""This means the higher cost of logistics is not a transitory phenomenon,"" Sand said. ""For inflation, that means trouble ... The element of shipping, in overall prices, small as it may be, is much bigger than ever before, and it could be a permanent lift to prices going forward.""
Ocean transport costs initially leapt after a six-day blockage of the Suez Canal in March caused backlogs worldwide. That tightened an already strained vessel-hiring market as uncertainty about future fuel and emissions regulation had driven orders for new ships to record lows.
Then came a surge in demand for goods from consumers in coronavirus lockdowns, while dockyards were struggling with COVID-related labour shortages.
In early November, 11% of the world's loaded container volume was being held up in logjams, down from August peaks but well above the pre-pandemic 7%, Berenberg analysts estimate.
BACKLOG UNTIL 2023
In late October at Los Angeles/Long Beach, one of the world's biggest container ports, ships were taking twice as long to turn around as before the pandemic, RBC Capital Markets estimates.
Although the worst may be past, RBC analyst Michael Tran does not see freight prices returning to pre-pandemic levels for another couple of years.
Even if plans to unload an extra 3,500 containers each week are implemented, the Los Angeles/Long Beach backlog is unlikely to clear before 2023, he said.
""The softening in prices we saw at the end of September is a false dawn. What we see from a big-data perspective is that things are not getting materially better.""
A United Nations report said last month that high freight rates were threatening the global recovery, suggesting they could boost global import prices by 11% and consumer prices by 1.5% between now and 2023.
The impact also ripples out; a 10% rise in container freight rates cuts U.S. and European industrial production by more than 1%.
'NOT WORTH IT'
The report noted that cheaper goods will proportionally rise more in price than dearer ones, and that poor nations producing low-value-added items such as furniture and textiles will take the biggest hit to competitiveness.
The retail price of a low-end refrigerator will rise 24% compared with 6.5% for a costlier brand, Ben May, head of macro research at Oxford Economics said, adding: ""Companies may just stop shipping very cheap fridges, as it just won't be worth it.""
The shipping boom was expected to abate as economic reopening allowed people to spend on travel and dining out rather than clothing or appliances.
But that theory is being challenged by new COVID variants, and the huge pandemic-time savings that customers could channel into even more goods.
During the last earnings season, toymaker Hasbro, retailer Dollar Tree and consumer goods giant Nestle were among companies bemoaning freight costs - and flagging price increases.
With the U.S. inventory-sales ratio near record lows, businesses will also need to restock.
""This will support demand for goods through the first half of next year,"" Unicredit analysts said.
The problem could get worse if smaller companies are unable to meet their commercial obligations and struggle to stay afloat, said James Gellert, CEO of analytics company RapidRatings:
""These time bombs are riddled through large enterprises' supply chains and will present many problems for their customers who rely on their goods and services.""
Real relief may come only when more vessels appear.
Ship orders have risen significantly this year. But it takes three years to build and deliver one, and it will be 2024 before sizeable new tonnage hits the water, senior ING economist Rico Luman predicted.

Dollar Tree last month unveiled plans to start selling most goods for $1.25 at all its namesake stores, in an effort to cushion the impact of spiraling freight costs and other pandemic-driven challenges.
""The board should undertake a thoughtful and deliberative review of the company's strategy,"" Mantle Ridge said, adding that Dollar Tree should examine the possibility of hiring former Dollar General Corp DG.N Chief Executive Officer Richard Dreiling to a leadership role.
J.P. Morgan analysts said last month the involvement of Dreiling at Dollar Tree could be a ""potential game-changer"", adding that he was the architect of Dollar General's turnaround story from 2008 to 2015 that saw its revenue double.
Mantle Ridge said one of its representatives and three advisers met with Dollar Tree's board to discuss the matters, and it expected to continue such talks.
The activist investor added that its affiliate delivered a notice to Dollar Tree's corporate secretary on Friday nominating 11 candidates for election to the company's board at its 2022 annual stockholders meeting.
None of the 11 nominees are currently on Dollar Tree's board.
Mantle Ridge disclosed a $1.8 billion stake in Dollar Tree in November, representing 5.7% of shares outstanding and an economic interest that would represent another 4.2% of shares.
Dollar Tree later that month reported a 4% rise in net sales, even as its net income declined.
Citi analyst Paul Lejuez at that time called the quarter ""not great"", even as he said the presence of Mantle Ridge is likely to keep investors hopeful that changes will persist at Dollar Tree, resulting in stronger sales and profitability.

Cryptos Go “Taylor Swift”
On Monday, news emerged that little-known Omicron Token (CCC:OMIC-USD) had jumped 1,000% overnight. It didn’t seem to matter that anonymous developers entirely controlled the token. If it shared its name with a new Covid-19 variant, people were buying.
One might call this the “Taylor Swift Effect,” after the unfortunately common (and androgynous) name that’s made life challenging for people who share a moniker with the singer-songwriter. Back in 2015, GQ Magazine reported how a now 36-year-old man, Taylor Adam Swift, had to change his email address after country music fans flooded his inbox with fan mail.
On the other hand, crypto investors seem to relish in the Taylor Swift effect and it’s crossed wires. Bitcoin Gold (CCC:BTG-USD), Ethereum Classic (CCC:ETC-USD) and other second-tier cryptos seem to spark interest every several months simply for sharing forks and names with their better-known siblings. And tokens from Mars Inu (CCC:MARSINU-USD) to MetaDoge (CCC:METADOGE-USD) top the “now trending” charts by re-cutting names like “Dogelon Mars” into something new.
Clearly, these knockoff tokens are poor long-term investments. Last I checked, Shiba Inu (CCC:SHIB-USD) remains the only meme copycat that breaks into the top-100 cryptocurrencies. But that hasn’t stopped speculators from trying their hand at the game anyway.
So, what to do about the “Taylor Swift” effect in crypto? Easy. When it comes to cheap coins, pick originals that have yet to break beyond $1.

3 Millionaire Maker Cryptocurrencies For Under $1
On Nov. 23, Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR) announced that after 35 years, the company would be raising prices to $1.25. The “Dollar-Twenty-Five Tree” might not have the same ring, but even the bargain discount retailer knew that a dollar was too good a deal to make in today’s economy.
7 Stocks to Buy to Hedge Against Rising Oil Prices
Meanwhile, many sub-$1 cryptocurrencies still offer great deals. These under-the-radar coins share an element that meme coins lack:
They all have some aspect of irreplaceability.
Whether attached to high-potential businesses or holding a special place in investors’ hearts, these coins are penny stock versions of CryptoLand that look set to succeed.
Crypto.com Coin (CRO)
When I first wrote about Crypto.com Coin (CCC:CRO-USD) in early November, it almost felt too late. The cryptocurrency had already risen from 6 cents to 33 cents since January and broken into the Top 50 coins by market cap.
But it was a timely call. CRO has since risen another 2.5x and now seems poised to break into the $1 range.
The reason for waiting was this:
Crypto trading apps have a habit of fading into oblivion.
Robinhood (NASDAQ:HOOD) now barely breaks into the Top 200 on the Apple app store, according to data collected by SensorTower. Webull, Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) and other trading platforms have seen similar dropoffs. It’s hard to sustain momentum in a saturated market.
Crypto.com has wisely taken a different tack. Rather than relying on crypto trading alone, the firm has turned to payments to boost revenues. You might trade $1,000 in Dogecoin (CCC:DOGE-USD) once a quarter, but easily spend that amount on household expenses every week (a fact that the Crypto.com credit card fully acknowledges).
Margins are also fatter for payments. Typical credit card fees range from 1.5% to 2.5%, compared to the pennies earned through Payment From Order Flow (PFOF) in trading. That’s why firms like Visa (NYSE:V) generate eight times more profit than Charles Schwab (NYSE:SCHW) despite having the same number of employees.
As Crypto.com continues to build out its payment capabilities, it should become a viable alternative to PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) and Square (NYSE:SQ). And at 75 cents, CRO is a crypto that’s still not too late to buy.
Dogecoin (DOGE)
I’ve long used the Momentum Master strategy to identify entry and exit points for Dogecoin. A momentum-seeking approach could have turned $10,000 into $1.2 million since January, nearly three times more than a buy-and-hold strategy.
The reason for the outperformance has more to do with psychology than black magic or luck. Dogecoin prices are largely retail-driven — and mom-and-pop investors tend to chase trends instead of making their own. If prices are going up, they’re the ones waiting in line to buy. And if they’re going down, these hot-money investors won’t stick around.
It’s also why eagle-eyed Moonshot readers will notice that Dogecoin has seen fewer mentions lately. DOGE has been in “sell” territory since dropping below 26 cents on Nov. 11.
Momentum Master: buy DOGE when it next crosses above 25 cents
But most importantly, Dogecoin is arguably the original “fun” coin. While younger investors jump between new pupcoin tokens in hopes of striking it rich, people tend to buy Dogecoin because it’s good, silly fun. And if you hold on for long enough, perhaps the top dog can still one day make you a millionaire.
Gala Games (GALA)
Those looking for a bit more adventure could consider Gala (CCC:GALA-USD), a token recently featured in Moonshot. Its high potential — paired with a sub-$1 price — makes it a coin to follow.
Eric Schiermeyer, co-founder of mobile game maker Zynga (NASDAQ:ZNGA), created Gala Games with a straightforward premise: creating blockchain games people want to play.
That’s a breath of fresh air. Blockchain gamers will quickly realize that most first-generation crypto games aren’t very enjoyable to play, at least in the traditional sense. NFT-based games typically involve collecting an indefinite number of online trinkets; gameplay is usually an afterthought.
Now, Gala Games wants to try their hand at recreating the success of Zynga’s Poker, Mafia Wars and Farmville games. With 90+ team members and 1.3 million monthly active users, the firm has a strong head start in professionalizing NFT game development.
No garage space for a collectible tank? What about a virtual one instead?
Success, of course, isn’t guaranteed. Zynga itself struggled to create more blockbuster games as mobile competition heated up. But so long as Mr. Schiermeyer’s firm stays ahead of the pack, there’s a greater chance that GALA will be a millionaire-maker crypto.

The Cheap Get Cheaper
Omicron variant fears have left no market untouched. On Monday, King Floki (CCC:KING-USD) shed 97% of its value within 24 hours. Baby Meta (CCC:BABYMETA-USD), Elonomics (CCC:ELONOM-USD) and BitcoinX (CCC:BCX-USD) weren’t far behind.
These price collapses laid bare something we all already know:
These tokens had zero value to start with and zero value in the end.
Yet investors still seem blindsided when they get rug-pulled, honeypotted, or see their token investments goes to zero. It’s like Groundhog Day, except people’s portfolios don’t magically reappear the following morning.
To illustrate why I largely avoid these copycat cryptos, consider the ease of deploying a new token:
Copy a BEP20 Token contract template (Binance offers a template here).
Change the name, symbol, decimals and total supply inputs on lines 347 to 350.
Upload to an IDE (Binance recommends Open Remix) to compile and deploy.
The entire process can take less than five minutes for those with basic coding skills. And for those less technologically inclined, sites like CreateMyToken.com and CoinTool.app offer point-and-click solutions instead.
Required coding changes for creating a BEP-20 token
With an infinite number of potential tokens, it’s no wonder why I stay away from hawking “the next Shiba Inu to make you rich.”
When Sub-$1 Coins Are Expensive
Dollar Tree… McDonald’s dollar menu… my office’s vending machine… $1 sales seem to have gone the way of the dodo, at least in the real world.
But not in CryptoLand. Twenty-four of the top 100 crypto tokens by market capitalization trade for less than a dollar, and the proportion only increases the further down the list you go.
One culprit is the all-too-human tendency to believe low-cost items are cheap. It’s why companies often practice “shrinkflation” (selling less product in the same size packaging) rather than raise product prices.
But with crypto, there’s a more straightforward reason: ERC-20 and BEP-20 allow 18 digits of accuracy, and programmers have been all-too-happy to make use of every single zero allowed. That’s why tokens such as MetaZilla (CCC:MZ-USD) carry prices of $0.000000000000000028.
So, before rushing off to buy a token with more decimals than you can count, remember that coins are much like calculating one’s net worth in Venezuelan Bolivar. You could have millions of the currency in your pocket, but becoming a U.S. dollar millionaire will take far more than just that.

2021-12-01 00:00:00+00:00,4 Things Real Estate Investors Should Know Going Into 2022,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/4-things-real-estate-investors-should-know-going-into-2022,,,"It's fair to say that 2020 was an intense year in the world of real estate investing. Widespread store closures hurt retail, and office buildings largely sat vacant as remote work took over.
The current year hasn't been as brutal. Store closures have slowed down tremendously, and offices have started to see signs of life. Hotels, which also saw record low occupancy rates in 2020, have started to enjoy a revival, fueled by leisure travel.
In the coming year, real estate investors could face their share of wins and challenges. Here are a few things to know as 2022 approaches.
Image source: Getty Images.
1. Malls could continue to struggle as digital sales boom
Though consumers were increasingly shopping online before the COVID-19 outbreak, the pandemic fueled that trend even more. And while we don't have final numbers from this year's holiday shopping season, Deloitte predicts that online spending will well outpace in-store spending.
All of this means that malls could really struggle in the coming year. As more consumers opt to spend their money online, retailers may be forced to shutter store locations that don't see enough foot traffic to justify keeping them open. And that could leave malls with a major vacancy crisis on their hands.
2. Shopping centers could thrive as discount brands expand
While the pandemic may have fueled an uptick in store closures, one breed of store that hasn't fallen victim to that trend is discount retailers. In fact, brands like Dollar General (NYSE: DG) and Dollar Tree (NASDAQ: DLTR) announced major store expansion plans this year, and those could continue well into 2022.
The winners in that scenario? Shopping centers. That's because dollar stores have the potential to serve as anchor tenants -- and fill vacancies left over by the pandemic.
3. Demand for warehouses and fulfillment centers could explode even more
Digital shopping may be bad for physical retailers and malls -- but it's great for industrial REITs, or real estate investment trusts. In 2022, we could see sustained demand for warehousing and distribution center space as retailers expand their online footprint and sink resources into faster order fulfillment.
4. Data centers could remain hot
The pandemic spurred a major uptick in workers doing their jobs remotely. And while companies are starting to call workers back to the office, many will no doubt remain remote in 2022.
That, combined with a general push toward digital record-keeping, could make data center REITs a very wise investment in 2022. As companies grow increasingly tech-savvy, high-capacity data centers should remain in demand.
What will 2022 have in store for real estate investors?
In the absence of a crystal ball, it's hard to say how well real estate investors will fare in the new year. But based on the trends that have emerged since the start of the pandemic, there's a good chance 2022 will be another tough year for malls, a decent year for shopping centers, and a strong year for industrial space as well as data centers. Investors may want to tweak their portfolios accordingly.

2021-12-01 00:00:00+00:00,Here's How Dollar Tree Is Staying Competitive in the Retail Game,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/heres-how-dollar-tree-is-staying-competitive-in-the-retail-game,,,"The coronavirus pandemic dealt a hard blow to retailers in 2020, as many nonessential stores were forced to shutter temporarily early on in the outbreak. But even once stores were able to reopen, many found that consumers just weren't spending, given the state of the economy last year. And even though this year's economy is stronger, some consumers are still spending more conservatively -- perhaps in an effort to recover from personal losses incurred in 2020.
But one breed of store has managed to emerge victorious in the wake of the pandemic: discount stores. While other brands have contemplated closures in 2021, dollar stores have expanded their footprint.
Dollar Tree (NASDAQ: DLTR) is one of them. Earlier in the year, it set a goal of opening 600 stores in 2021 and renovating 1,250 existing locations in an effort to stay competitive. But that's not the only thing Dollar Tree is doing to retain its edge.

Introducing same-day delivery
During the pandemic, consumers have increasingly relied on delivery services largely due to safety concerns, but also due to the convenience factor. Dollar stores don't traditionally offer delivery. But Dollar Tree is changing that.
The discount chain has teamed up with Instacart to offer same-day deliveries for customers. What started as a pilot program involving 275 stores has since increased to 7,000 locations.
It's a strategic move, to say the last. As discount stores continue to expand, those offering the most value to customers are more apt to command a larger share of the market. Dollar Tree is capitalizing on the e-commerce trend by recognizing the need to offer consumers not just delivery but same-day service. And in doing so, Dollar Tree might manage to convert some skeptics -- consumers who traditionally don't shop at discount stores under the assumption that their selection is too limited.
Of course, to really remain competitive, Dollar Tree will need to find a way to keep its prices as close to the $1 mark as possible. Recently, the retailer announced plans to shift its price point to $1.25 for most items -- a natural response to recent supply chain woes and inflation, but a blow to consumers nonetheless.
But offering delivery could help offset these higher prices. This especially holds true if Dollar Tree manages to capture a new audience with its delivery offering -- consumers who don't need to shop at dollar stores due to financial constraints but who start opting to shop there for the convenience factor alone.
What real estate investors should know
At a time when so many stores have shuttered on a permanent basis, dollar stores are helping to keep shopping centers afloat. And real estate investors with shopping centers in their portfolios need discount chains to continue to thrive in the coming years, as has been the case since the start of the pandemic.
By offering same-day delivery, Dollar Tree can help to secure its spot as a shopping center mainstay, all while growing its customer base, so that it has the potential to expand even more at a time when store closures have become more commonplace.

2021-11-30 00:00:00+00:00,9 Stocks to Buy Before Inflation Fears Take Hold,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/9-stocks-to-buy-before-inflation-fears-take-hold,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Despite the pandemic, the stock market has had a decent year so far. Right now, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 14% year-to-date (YTD) while the S&P 500 is up over 23% YTD. But with the threat of inflation currently stoking fears in the fourth quarter, now is the time to start considering inflation stocks.
Inflation stocks provide some protection when prices begin to skyrocket. In October, the consumer price index rose 6.2% from a year ago, which is the biggest increase in 30 years. Core inflation also rose by an alarming rate, moving higher by 4.6% from a year ago.
But all is not lost. CNBC “Mad Money” host Jim Cramer says there are plenty of ways to grow your portfolio even when inflation rises. Cramer says that some of the best inflation stocks come from banking, large pharmaceuticals and tech companies. He noted the following:
“That’s a huge chunk of this market, unlike any combination I’ve ever seen. Plenty of winners out there if you just stop freaking out and start looking at the opportunities.”
Other proven strategies include looking for solid dividend growth, as well as seeking names that help consumers stretch their paychecks.
7 Travel Stocks to Pack in Your Portfolio Ahead of Holiday Trips
Here are nine solid inflation stocks to buy in Q4:
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)
American Express (NYSE:AXP)
Chevron (NYSE:CVX)
Dollar General (NYSE:DG)
Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR)
Newmont (NYSE:NEM)
Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA)

Inflation Stocks to Buy: Apple (AAPL)

First up on this list of inflation stocks, Apple is one of those names that could possibly be considered inflation-proof. With a market capitalization of more than $2.6 trillion as well as more than $191 billion in cash on hand, AAPL stock can easily withstand any downturn in the market.
But you shouldn’t expect Apple to drop at all. Returns so far in 2021 are 24%. The company should also see strong sales numbers for the holiday shopping season in Q4. Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives says Apple was expected to sell 10 million iPhones over the Black Friday weekend.
This company’s fiscal Q4 earnings came in a $1.24 per share, up around 70% from a year ago. For the quarter, sales also rose 29% to $83.4 billion. However, revenue missed analyst expectations due to semiconductor chip shortages.
American Express (AXP)

American Express isn’t the biggest or best-known name in the credit card space. However, AXP stock may be one of the best inflation stocks to buy during these inflationary times.
Why? Well, American Express caters to business clients as well as individuals who are more well-off. It makes 82% of its money “from discount fees, card fees, travel-related commissions and other revenue.” Only 18% of its money comes from interest.
In the third quarter, AXP delivered $2.27 per share and revenue of $10.9 billion. Both numbers beat analyst estimates.

This pick is up nearly 28% so far in 2021. Currently, it trades at a forward price-earnings (P/E) ratio of 16.56 times and a forward price-sales (P/S) ratio of 2.93 times.
Inflation Stocks to Buy: Chevron (CVX)
Source: LesPalenik / Shutterstock.com
What’s one of the first thing that investors do when they fear inflation? They buy oil. One hedge fund, Man Group, says that energy commodities were the “best performing asset class” in the last eight inflationary periods. That’s why a major oil company like Chevron is a solid pick when looking for inflation stocks.
Chevron is already up more than 37% YTD, but even at these lofty highs CVX stock is far off the highs it reached back in 2018. Right now, it’s coming off a huge Q3, in which the company posted its best quarterly profit in eight years. Net income was $6.11 billion, versus a loss of $207 million in the prior-year period. Finally, cash flow from operations came in at $8.5 billion.
What happened? Of course, Chevron and other oil companies suffered greatly last year when the oil market collapsed because of the pandemic. Because of that, Chevron made big budget cuts. Now that’s being reflected in this year’s profits. In fact, Chevron says that its spending so far this year is 22% lower than a year ago. That gives it an outsized profit margin.
On top of it all, CVX stock pays a great 4.68% dividend.
Dollar General (DG)

Inflation means that consumers will have less money to spend for both necessary and discretionary spending. For instance, there are already reports of meat and other staples costing more today. Because of that, I always consider dollar stores like Dollar General when I think about inflation stocks.
Based in Tennessee, Dollar General operates more than 17,600 stores across some 46 states. This company’s strategy is to put stores in neighborhoods in order to spread its footprint as wide as possible. Once inside, customers can fine low-cost food, snacks, cleanings supplies, health and beauty products, clothing and seasonal items.
For the year, Dollar General stock is up 6%. Revenue is up by around 53% since 2017, according to Seeking Alpha. What’s more, the company has a reasonable forward P/E of 22 times.

Inflation Stocks to Buy: Dollar Tree (DLTR)

Based in Virginia, Dollar Tree is a different kind of discount retailer than Dollar General. With more than 15,000 stores across 48 states as well as in Canada, Dollar Tree buys bulk items and sells them at low prices.
How low? Until recently, items in the store were a dollar (hence the name), but this pick of the inflation stocks recently announced that it was raising the prices of items to $1.25. Additionally, according to NPR, Dollar Tree has been testing higher-priced items for a few months, including adding $3 and $5 products in its Dollar Tree Plus stores.
If nothing else, raising prices will allow Dollar Tree to expand and sell a wider variety of sizes and products.
Most recently, Q3 earnings came in at $6.42 billion and earnings at 96 cents per share. Both exceeded analyst expectations of $6.41 billion and 95 cents per share. Currently, DLTR stock is up a whopping 25% YTD in 2021.
Newmont (NEM)
Source: Piotr Swat/Shutterstock
Next up on this list of inflation stocks is Newmont. Gold is a natural hedge against inflation and a market downturn. Sure, cryptocurrencies are flashier and have had a much higher return in the last few months. Still, NEM stock is a solid pick here.
Newmont is the world’s largest gold miner. What’s more, Joule Financial’s Quint Tatro recently told CNBC that NEM is one of his top picks against inflation. The company added to its position in NEM stock after the consumer price index report came out.
“Newmont has an incredible balance sheet. It is truly a proxy for gold. It should move in lockstep with gold if we’re right, and we get paid almost 4% to wait […] I think it will do very well […] You’re getting it at a discount, and I believe that it will continue to rise with gold if we continue to see core inflation move up as well.”

Right now, NEM stock is down by around 8% so far this year. But Fundamental Research analyst Siddharth Rajeev maintained his “buy” rating on the stock, setting a price target of $63.10. That represents more than 14% upside today, which would be welcome during an inflationary run.
Inflation Stocks to Buy: Nvidia (NVDA)
Source: rafapress / Shutterstock.com
According to VandaTrack, which is a Vanda Research flow tracker that measures net stock purchases, NVDA stock was one of the most-purchased equities on Wall Street in November.
Why? Well, Nvidia is absolutely on fire. Up by more than 140% so far in 2021, Nvidia is currently priced at more than $320 per share.
Recognized as one of the world’s biggest semiconductor companies, Nvidia is in an enviable position. Remember, we are still in a chip shortage — and those chips are needed to run everything from electric vehicles (EVs) to computers and small electronics.
If supply and demand rules the world, then this name is in the catbird seat. And that demand is not going to go away just because of inflation.
This pick of the inflation stocks reported its Q3 earnings on Nov. 17. For the period, revenue was up 50% year-over-year (YOY) to $7.1 billion, beating analyst expectations of $6.81 billion. Earnings per share was $1.17, which topped expectations of $1.11.
Target (TGT)
Source: jejim / Shutterstock.com
Next up on this pick of inflation stocks, Target is a discount retailer that operates higher-end stores than Dollar General and its peers. Presently, TGT stock is up nearly 40% so far in 2021 but slipped after the company reported Q3 earnings in mid-November.
What happened? Well, the company did manage to beat analyst expectations in earnings and revenue. Plus, it raised its outlook. But Target also warned that its margins would be pressured in the coming months as labor costs increase and supply-chain disruptions persist.
7 Cheap Stocks Under $10 That Are Actually Worth Your Time
No worries, though. That dip is just a solid buying opportunity in TGT stock. One Bank of America analyst also agrees, according to CNBC. Analysts at Raymond James and DA Davidson raised their price targets for Target shares as well.
Inflation Stocks to Buy: Walmart (WMT)

That brings us to the last entry on this list of inflation stocks: Walmart. This name is the biggest retailer on the planet and boasts revenues of $519 billion according to the National Retail Federation. Walmart operates 10,500 stores across 24 countries.
With its expanding footprint (Walmart owns Sam’s Club, among other brands) and its growing online presence, Walmart had a solid Q3. But what really made the difference was the company’s grocery offerings. Walmart says its size helped it navigate supply chains and keep shelves stocked. CFO Brett Biggs told CNBC the following:
“We’ve always been an inflation fighter for customers […] Our scale and the product breadth that we have allows us to do things in a way that is beneficial to customers and beneficial to shareholders.”
For the quarter, revenue came in at $140.53 billion, versus the $135.6 billion that analysts expected. What’s more, earnings per share came in at $1.45 versus expectations of $1.40.

2021-11-25 00:00:00+00:00,What Do Dollar Tree’s Newly Added Risk Factors Tell Investors?,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/what-do-dollar-trees-newly-added-risk-factors-tell-investors,,,"Virginia-based Dollar Tree (DLTR) is an American operator of discount variety stores. It operates a chain of nearly 16,000 stores under brands like Dollar Tree, Family Dollar, and Dollar Tree Canada. For decades, the retailer has focused on selling an assortment of items that cost $1 or less. But it is making the transition to the $1.25 price point in a bid to offer shoppers a broader variety and boost its margins. It has tested the higher price point at a number of stores and got positive feedback from customers. Therefore, Dollar Tree is gearing up to shift to the new price across its network of stores. With this in mind, let us take a look at the company's latest financial performance and understand its the newly added risks. (See Top Smart Score Stocks on TipRanks)
Q3 Financial Results
Dollar Tree reported a 3.9% year-over-year increase in revenue to $6.42 billion for the third quarter 2021. Meanwhile, it posted earnings of $0.96 per share. The retailer ended the quarter with $701 million in cash and $3.25 billion debt. (See Dollar Tree stock charts on TipRanks).
Risk Factors
According to the new TipRanks' Risk Factors tool, Dollar Tree's main risk categories are Finance and Corporate and Production, which account for 26 each of the total 31 risks identified for the stock. The company has recently updated its profile with eight new risks under various risk categories. Under the Finance and Corporate risk factor, the company tells investors that its distribution network is difficult to operate efficiently. It cites the challenge of attracting and retaining a reliable and adequate workforce. The company has resorted to using inducements such as wage increases and sign-on bonus in some markets to address the labor shortage at its distribution centers. However, such measures are increasing its costs and may adversely impact its profitability. Further, there is no guarantee that such measures will be enough to maintain the level of workforce required to run the distribution centers efficiently. Under the Production risk category, the company highlights that labor disagreements resulting in strikes may delay the delivery of goods to its distribution centers and stores. It also says that its shipping and trucking costs have been increasing. The company says that it has been resorted to using the expensive spot market for ocean shipments as a result of its contracted carriers being unable to meet all of its shipping needs. In trucking, Dollar Tree says it is experiencing a shortage of truck drivers and an increase in diesel costs. Under the Macro and Political risk category, Dollar Tree cautions about the potential adverse impact of climate change on its business. The company says that extreme weather events and natural disasters could disrupt the supply chain, result in product shortages in stores, and increase operating costs. The Finance and Corporate risk factors' sector average is at 34%, compared to Dollar Tree’s 26%. Shares of the company have increased 36% year-to-date.
Wall Street's Take
Following Dollar Tree’s third quarter earnings report, Gordon Haskett Capital analyst Charles Grom upgraded the stock to Buy with a price target of $170. Grom’s price target suggests 15.95% upside potential. The analyst noted that the shift to the $1.25 price point, which will roll out to all Dollar Tree stores by the end of the first quarter of 2022, increases the retailer’s chances of success. Consensus among analysts is a Moderate Buy based on 8 Buys, 8 Holds and 1 Sell. The average Dollar Tree price target of $151.75 implies 3.51% upside potential to current levels.

2021-11-24 00:00:00+00:00,Interesting DLTR Put And Call Options For January 2022,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/interesting-dltr-put-and-call-options-for-january-2022,,,"Investors in Dollar Tree Inc (Symbol: DLTR) saw new options become available today, for the January 2022 expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the DLTR options chain for the new January 2022 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $145.00 strike price has a current bid of $5.85. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $145.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $139.15 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of DLTR, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $145.96/share today.
Because the $145.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 55%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 4.03% return on the cash commitment, or 33.47% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Dollar Tree Inc, and highlighting in green where the $145.00 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $147.00 strike price has a current bid of $6.25. If an investor was to purchase shares of DLTR stock at the current price level of $145.96/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $147.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 4.99% if the stock gets called away at the January 2022 expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if DLTR shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Dollar Tree Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing DLTR's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $147.00 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $147.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 50%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 4.28% boost of extra return to the investor, or 35.52% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.
The implied volatility in the put contract example is 36%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 38%.
Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $145.96) to be 35%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

2021-11-24 00:00:00+00:00,Investors watch retail stocks as U.S. holiday shopping beckons,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/investors-watch-retail-stocks-as-u.s.-holiday-shopping-beckons,,,"By Caroline Valetkevitch
NEW YORK, Nov 24 (Reuters) - Investors are zeroing in on a number of hot retailers' shares as the U.S. holiday shopping season kicks into high gear this week, weighing the potential for supply chain problems against expected strong consumer demand.
The day after the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday, Black Friday, has for years unofficially marked the start of the holiday shopping period and one of the busiest shopping days of the year.
But the ongoing coronavirus pandemic and its effect on supplies have likely driven shoppers out early, as evidenced by a recent Commerce Department report showing U.S. retail sales surged in October.
""We're in a very different place now and for the last two years. Christmas is a four-month season, starting in October,"" said Phil Orlando, chief equity strategist and head of the client portfolio management team at Federated Hermes in New York.
Among other trends, the Black Friday average promotional discount is lower than in previous years, according to data compiled by Refinitiv and StyleSage Co, a data analytics platform, suggesting consumers may not see the bargains they've seen before.
But analysts have become more bullish on the holiday shopping season, according to data polled by Refinitiv, which noted that discounters, home furnishing and home improvement companies are expected to see among the strong same-store sales growth.
Many retailers have outperformed the broader market this year. An S&P retail exchange-traded fund XRT.P is up 57% since Dec. 31, compared with about a 25% gain in the S&P 500 .SPX year-to-date.
Refinitiv pointed to a number of companies facing ""difficult comparisons"" in the fourth quarter versus a year ago, when sales were strong, but that still have upbeat forecasts for this quarter, including Crocs Inc CROX.O, Williams-Sonoma WSM.N, Lowe's Cos LOW.N, Home Depot HD.N, Lululemon Athletica LULU.O, and Target TGT.N.
""Last year they knocked it out of the park, and you're still seeing strong numbers, which suggests that strength and demand for the products are holding up very well,"" said Jharonne Martis, director of consumer research at Refinitiv.
Among the retailers with the best year-to-day gains are Bath & Body Works BBWI.N, Tractor Supply TSCO.O Autozone AZO.N and Etsy ETSY.O.
Recent earnings reports from retailers have cited problems with supply disruptions and strategists say inventory levels could be a problem for some retailers this shopping season.
Gap Inc. GPS.N late Thursday lowered its full-year forecast amid supply chain disruptions including factory closures, and its stock plunged in after-hours trade.
Last week, Walmart Inc WMT.N raised its annual sales and profit forecast but global supply-chain disruptions hit its margins in the third quarter.
Online spending will be strong again this holiday season, the Refinitiv analysis also showed, so all eyes will be on Amazon.com AMZN.O.
""Online is going to rule the day,"" Orlando said, and he said overall the companies that are likely to do better this season are the ones that have been able to find a way around supply logjams, such as Amazon, and possibly Target, Walmart and Costco COST.O.
Shares of big department stores that typically draw heavier traffic during the holidays also will be closely watched, including Macy's M.N, Kohl's KSS.N and Nordstrom JWN.N, as well as companies with consumer brand favorites, like Apple AAPL.O.
Shares of Macy's M.N shot up last week after the company raised its sales and profit outlooks and signaled it was well stocked for the holiday season.

Dick’s Sporting Goods (NYSE:DKS) stock isn’t doing so hot on Tuesday following the release of its earnings report for the third quarter of 2021.

Let’s jump into that earnings report below to see why holders of DKS stock are disappointed today!
Let’s get the basics out of the way first, which includes adjusted earnings per share of $3.19 on revenue of $2.75 billion.
Both of these easily beat out Wall Street’s estimates of $1.97 per share and revenue of $2.5 billion.
The company’s adjusted EPS also represents a 59% increase over the $2.01 reported during the same time last year.
Its revenue is also sitting 13.9% higher than the $2.41 billion reported in the third quarter of 2020.
All of that sounds like great news, so why are investors unhappy with DKS stock today.
It has to do with slowing revenue growth.
Sure, that 13.9% revenue increase sounds like a win, until you compare it to the company’s 40% revenue increase from Q3 2019 to Q3 2020.

Consolidated same-store sales show a similar slowing growth with an increase of 12.2% year-over-year for Q3 2021.
Yet again, that’s doesn’t match up to the retailer’s consolidated same-store sales growth of 23.2% from Q3 2019 to Q3 2020.
The slowing revenue growth at Dick’s Sporting Goods likely has some investors worried that the company is getting close to stagnation.
We’ll have to wait and see how DKS performs in its next few earnings report to see if that’s the case.
Either way, today’s news brings heavy trading to DKS stock.
This has some 4.7 million shares moving as of this writing.
That’s above the company’s daily average trading volume of 2.4 million shares.
DKS stock is down 9.6% as of Tuesday afternoon.
