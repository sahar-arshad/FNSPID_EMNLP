NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Dollar stores can only be so thrifty. On Thursday two U.S. discount retailers, Dollar Tree https://www.dollartreeinfo.com/news-releases/news-release-details/dollar-tree-inc-reports-results-second-quarter-fiscal-2021 and Dollar General https://newscenter.dollargeneral.com/news/dollar-general-corporation-reports-second-quarter-2021-results.htm, warned that surging costs in supply chains could cut into profit. The $25 billion Dollar Tree said its regular carriers would only be able to fulfill up to 65% of their commitments. Spot prices for ocean freight from China have increased 20% since May, the company said. Its shares fell some 10%.
Ultra-discount retailers do well when the economy and shoppers are struggling, thanks to their low prices, as advertised by their names. But that business model leaves them little room to pass on rising costs even if consumers can afford them at the time.
Analysts are expecting American retail giant Walmart’s revenue to grow just 1% this fiscal year. But its EBITDA margin should clock in at 8%, according to data from Refinitiv. At Dollar Tree, top-line growth is forecast at 3%, but the margin at just 3%. For these retailers, pressure on supply costs makes every dollar store https://www.breakingviews.com/considered-view/dollar-tree-proves-money-doesnt-grow-on-mergers/?bved=NTk%3D&bvshr=MTI5ODg5 worth less.

2021-08-26 00:00:00+00:00,Why Dollar Tree Stock Just Got Chopped 10%,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-dollar-tree-stock-just-got-chopped-10-2021-08-26,,,"What happened
Tim-berrrr! Shares of Dollar Tree (NASDAQ: DLTR) stock are tumbling 10.4% as of 9:55 a.m. EDT Thursday after the retail chain reported a mixed quarter featuring better-than-expected earnings but worse-than-expected sales.
Heading into the second quarter, analysts had forecast Dollar Tree would earn $1.01 per share -- and management beat that, reporting $1.23 per share instead. The problem is, sales that were supposed to come in at $6.44 billion turned out to be only $6.34 billion instead.
Cue sell-off.
Image source: Getty Images.
So what
Dollar Tree managed to grow its earnings 12% year over year despite growing sales only 1% -- pretty impressive, especially with same-store sales declining more than 1%. Management attributed the improvement largely to a 150-basis-point slimming of its selling, general, and administrative expenses, which offset declining gross profit margin.
Nevertheless, CEO Michael Witynski worried aloud over ""continuing and well-publicized challenges in the global supply chain, as well as higher freight costs and other inflationary pressures"" that are pressuring the company's margins.
Now what
And those concerns bled into the company's outlook for Q3 2021, as well as for the full year fiscal 2021. In Q3, management forecasts sales ranging as high as $6.52 billion -- comfortably ahead of Wall Street estimates -- but profits of only $0.88 to $0.98 per share -- well below analyst forecasts for $1.26.
Similarly for the year, Dollar Tree thinks sales could conceivably exceed analyst expectations for $26.4 billion in annual revenue. Earnings, however, will be only $5.40 to $5.60 per share, as freight costs continue to surge higher. That's as much as $0.45 per share below what the company previously promised, and far short of Wall Street's hoped-for $5.99.
And that, in an acorn's shell, is why Dollar Tree shares are down today.

2021-08-25 00:00:00+00:00,ANALYSIS-Higher U.S. food benefits give legs to dollar stores' fresh food push,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/analysis-higher-u.s.-food-benefits-give-legs-to-dollar-stores-fresh-food-push-2021-08-25,,,"By Richa Naidu and Aishwarya Venugopal
CHICAGO, Aug 25 (Reuters) - U.S. dollar stores including Dollar General and Family Dollar are likely to see a sales and earnings boost from the Biden administration's plan to hike food stamp benefits, an added payoff for the chains' strategy to tap the $274 billion fresh food market.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) said last week that as part of a plan to promote a more nutritious diet among Americans, it is raising average Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits by more than 25% versus pre-pandemic levels.
In a $1 trillion food-at-home industry, the additional payout is expected to potentially add about $6 billion of increased funding to shoppers' wallets starting in October, analysts at Evercore said.
Under the new rules, average monthly benefits, $121 per person before the pandemic, will rise by $36. All 42 million people in the program will receive additional aid.
With the additional $36, ""you would expect they would buy more things like meat, fish, fruits and vegetables because those are high-priced items that tend to be responsive to income changes,"" said Joe Glauber, former USDA chief economist and a senior research fellow at the International Food Policy Research Institute.
Dollar stores count on low-income shoppers, and welfare checks tend to drive sales. In the pandemic, sales have skyrocketed with the help of shoppers benefiting from stimulus money, food stamps, child tax credits and higher wages in a tight labor market.
A Dollar General store in Norridge, Chicago sells 30-cent bunches of bananas and charges 75 cents for a lemon. This compares to a single banana that costs 27 cents at a Kroger-owned KR.N Mariano's store in a similar neighborhood in Chicago, where lemons cost 89 cents each.
A GREAT POSITION
""They (dollar stores) are going to have a tremendous benefit from this step-up in government support,"" said Mark Cohen, the director of retail studies at Columbia Business School and former chief executive of Sears Canada. ""It plays perfectly into the hands of their existing customer base, who now will have more money to spend.""
Dollar stores run thousands of outlets that are walking distance from shoppers who use government assistance to buy food.
""We do well when she (the customer) has a little extra money to spend ... Now if things start to more normalize and/or go the other way, then we're in a great position as well because she needs us even more,"" Dollar General Chief Executive Officer Todd Vasos said at an industry conference in June.
In securities filings, the company flags the importance of SNAP to its earnings. Both Dollar General DG.N and Dollar Tree DLTR.O, which declined to comment, will report earnings on Thursday.
If SNAP recipients have more to spend, they're more likely to buy more expensive food at dollar stores like fresh items that require refrigeration, Scott Vinson, the National Retail Federation's vice president for government relations, food and energy policy, said.
Still, not everyone trusts dollar stores for fresh produce, especially with big retailers such as Walmart and Target bolstering their offerings.
""I just don't like the quality of it...I feel produce would be better at other places so I never really looked here, to be honest with you,"" said Laura, 56, an accountant from Harwood Heights, Chicago who was loading up her cart with packaged food at the Norridge store.

2021-08-23 00:00:00+00:00,Good Defensive Stocks To Buy This Week? 3 To Watch,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/good-defensive-stocks-to-buy-this-week-3-to-watch-2021-08-23,,,"3 Top Defensive Stocks To Add To Your Radar Before September 2021
With the broader stock market seeing some major volatility over the past week, I could see investors eyeing defensive stocks now. This would make sense given two key factors at play currently. For starters, with Delta variant coronavirus cases on the rise, investors are understandably spooked. So much so that several key names in the reopening trade continue to lose steam in the stock market today. We can see this in the likes of Expedia Group (NASDAQ: EXPE) and Airbnb (NASDAQ: ABNB).
Additionally, investors also seem to be wary about the Federal Reserve’s current talks about tapering. This could especially be the case this week as Fed officials meet for their annual symposium virtually. Recall that last week’s meeting minutes release caused a strong reaction from investors. Now, given all of this, some would argue that defensive stocks could be a viable play in the stock market.
After all, this sector of the stock market mainly consists of companies whose offerings see continual demand. What this means is that their core businesses are more or less stable regardless of the current business cycles. For instance, this would include utility operators like Sempra Energy (NYSE: SRE) and American Water Works (NYSE: AWK). Another example would be consumer staples stocks like Target (NYSE: TGT). With these companies’ wares and services remaining relevant in good times and bad, I can understand the current appeal. On that note, here are three top defensive stocks to know in the stock market now.
Best Defensive Stocks To Buy [Or Sell] This Week
FedEx Corporation (NYSE: FDX)
UnitedHealth Group Inc. (NYSE: UNH)
Dollar Tree Company (NASDAQ: DLTR)
FedEx Corporation
To begin with, we will be taking a look at the FedEx Corporation. In brief, it is one of, if not the most prominent player in the logistics industry today. Through its vast portfolio, the company connects consumers and businesses across the globe. It accomplishes this via a massive delivery network spanning across over 220 countries and territories. Given the scale and presence of FedEx, investors could be eyeing FDX stock now as a viable defensive stock. With gains of over 140% since its pandemic-era low, could it still have room to grow this year?
Well, for one thing, the company continues to bolster its already massive operations. Earlier this month, news broke of FedEx employing robotic solutions in its facility at Queens, New York. The company is currently using an artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled Robotic Product Sortation and Identification (RPSi) system. Courtesy of AI firm Berkshire Grey (NASDAQ: BGRY), the RPSi can autonomously process, identify, sort, collect and containerize individual packages. This ranges from individual polybags and tubes to padded mailers among other small packages.
Overall, managing director Ted Dengel believes that the tech brings “significant benefits” to FedEx’s operations. According to Dengel, this includes increased safety and productivity, enhancing customer services, and greater system flexibility. Not to mention, the RPSi will reportedly learn over time, allowing for greater efficiency over time. As FedEx is bringing next-gen innovations to further refine its work, could FDX stock be a top buy for you?

UntiedHealth Group Inc.
Following that, we will be taking a look at UnitedHealth Group (UNH). The Minnesota-based multinational company primarily works in the managed health care and insurance industry. As you can imagine, UNH offers a broad spectrum of healthcare products and services. The company can do this via its two flagship platforms. Firstly, the UnitedHealthcare platform provides health care coverage and benefits services. Secondly, the Optum platform provides information and tech-enabled health services.
Given the relevance of UNH’s offerings amidst the current pandemic, UNH stock could be another defensive stock to consider. Understandably, should coronavirus fears continue to grow among the general public, consumers would be prioritizing their overall health more. Likewise, it seems that investors are keen on UNH stock as well. This is evident as the company’s shares are sitting on year-to-date gains of over 22% and trading towards newer heights. The real question now is, would it still be worth jumping on?
If anything, we could take a look at the company’s financials to get a better understanding of this. Last month, UNH reported a total revenue of $71.3 billion in its second-quarter fiscal. This marks a sizable 15% year-over-year increase. On top of that, the company also ended the quarter with a cool $19.83 billion in cash on hand. All in all, CEO Andrew Witty cites this solid performance as a supporting factor for UNH’s confidence regarding meeting its long-term goals. Arguably, should things go as planned, we could see UNH stock continue to gain. Would you say the same?

Dollar Tree Inc.
Another name to consider in the defensive stock trade now would be Dollar Tree. Sure, most would not immediately consider Dollar Tree a defensive stock right off the bat. However, the company’s business strategy could attract more consumers as stimulus funds begin to dry up. For the uninitiated, the company operates via a network of over 15,000 discount stores. The likes of which span across 48 U.S. states and Canada.
Now, as the name suggests, all of the items at Dollar Tree’s stores cost $1 or less. Should consumers be looking to save on certain everyday items, Dollar Tree could be a go-to. At the same time, DLTR stock has mostly been trading sideways for the past month. Would this present an opportunity for investors now? Notably, investment management firm Madison Funds appears to believe so. In its recent second-quarter investor letter, the firm provided a rosy update regarding its holdings in Dollar Tree.
Namely, the firm wrote, “Operating as the only ‘true’ fixed-dollar-price-point retailer at scale, Dollar Tree has carved out a unique position within the retail landscape that has proven very difficult for others to replicate. The model’s consistent demand profile is equally impressive, with the business only reporting one negative year of same-store-sales growth over the past 25 years.” Not to mention, Dollar Tree also saw green across the board in its latest quarter fiscal posted back in May. In particular, the company posted year-over-year gains of 51% in net income and 53% in earnings per share. With Dollar Tree set to report its second-quarter fiscal this week, would you consider investing in DLTR stock?

2021-08-23 00:00:00+00:00,This Booming Retail Stock Has Crushed Rivals Over the Past Year,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/this-booming-retail-stock-has-crushed-rivals-over-the-past-year-2021-08-23,,,"The coronavirus pandemic devastated wide swathes of the retail industry, but some pockets of the sector have shown tremendous growth recently. By catering to a niche customer group, focus can be an extremely lucrative recipe for success.
One retail stock that particularly stands out is Five Below (NASDAQ: FIVE). While the company is smaller than its rivals Dollar General and Dollar Tree with a market capitalization of under $13 billion, its stock has soared an impressive 109% over the past year, outperforming its discount-store peers by a wide margin.
Data by YCharts.
Here's why you'll want to start paying attention to this market-beating stock.
Stellar performance metrics
Five Below primarily caters to teens and tweens (those aged 10 to 13), selling a wide assortment of goods ranging from apparel and beauty products to home décor and electronics. Items are typically priced between $1 and $5, and the shopping experience is characterized as a treasure hunt atmosphere, encouraging customers to visit more often with the hopes of finding a great deal.
The company operated 1,087 stores in 39 states as of its fiscal first quarter, a figure that has grown remarkably over the years. From fiscal 2017 through fiscal 2020, Five Below opened 498 net new locations, which management cites as the company's largest growth driver. It's clearly working as revenue and net income in fiscal 2020 more than doubled from 2015 levels.
All of this expansion has been financed with cash on hand, resulting in Five Below having zero debt on its balance sheet. For a retailer, this is a rarity, but it makes the business resilient to adverse economic times, like what the world faced last year.
The unit economics are what really stand out. Although the average cost to build a new Five Below store is $300,000, the average ""four-wall EBITDA"" (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization), which measures the profitability per store, is $450,000 in the first year. Therefore, the return on investment is a whopping 150% not long after a store opens with each location generating greater than $2 million in first-year sales. You'd be hard-pressed to find another retailer with these kinds of numbers.

A robust growth outlook
Five Below's fiscal first-quarter results showcased its continued momentum with revenue and net income up 64% and 93%, respectively, compared to the same quarter in fiscal 2019 (for a pre-pandemic comparison). A total of 67 net new stores opened their doors during the quarter as well. ""We believe we remain in a position of strength to continue growing Five Below and driving sustainable, long-term value for all stakeholders,"" CEO Joel Anderson said in the press release.
And management believes the expansion is far from over. They think Five Below can one day operate 2,500 locations in the U.S. This should come as no surprise, given how successful Five Below's outlets have been thus far.
Targeting a younger demographic gives the business a potential lifelong customer base. Familiarizing teens and tweens with the brand means that when they grow older and have their own families, they're more likely to continue shopping at Five Below. Furthermore, the average annual household income for Five Below's customers is $73,000, substantially higher than those who shop with competitors like Dollar General. That also bodes well for the company's prospects.
It's certainly true the brick-and-mortar retail sector has suffered over the years in the shadow of e-commerce's tremendous growth, but Five Below's success shows there are still lucrative corners in the sector where investors can put their money to work. The stock does command a premium trading at 48 times forward earnings estimates, so if the price tag is keep you away for now, you should still add this discount retailer to your watch list.

It has been a rocky few weeks for the stock market amid concerns that a resurgence in Covid-19 cases would slow economic growth. Moreover, gold prices have also risen in the past few weeks, worrying investors about inflationary pressures. Hence, they are looking to forego riskier investments and avoid catching the proverbial falling knife stocks.
Moreover, as my colleague Josh Enomoto pointed out in his recent article, employment levels are still low, suggesting that “we have fewer people with means to support current rich valuations.” In other words, the market is ripe for those dangerous-to-catch stocks.
What are we talking about here? These are stocks that have experienced a sharp decline in a short period. It is essentially a metaphor used to describe the quick sinking in the price of a stock. You think you’ve caught it near the bottom, only to get injured when it slides further.

7 Tech Stocks to Avoid Until They Turn Things Around
Investors need to have an understanding of how to go about such investments. They might wait for the stock price to bottom out, as it could rebound sharply. Here is a list of falling knife stocks worth your analysis now.

Falling Knife Stocks To Avoid: Tesla (TSLA)

Electric vehicle giant Tesla is trading at ridiculous levels and is arguably one of the top sentiment-driven stocks in the market. However, in the past six months, investor have lost 12.8% of their shares’ value. Despite the pullback, TSLA stock’s current price still makes hardly any sense relative to its underlying business despite its profitability.
True, Tesla is the leader in the EV realm, but the mounting competition in the sector will weigh in on its long-term prospects. Its competitors have solid brand equity, and some of them have established their dominance in particular markets. Moreover, a whole host of EV companies will be making the rounds in the next couple of years.
TSLA stock is trading at a dumbfounding 19 times forward sales, something that should have us all scratching our heads over. The bloated valuation is giving in to the weaknesses in the market, which is why the stock has been shedding more of its value in recent days.
Dollar Tree (DLTR)

Discounted goods retailer Dollar Tree did reasonably well to weather the Covid-19 crisis. However, with its lukewarm earnings results and light profit guidance, DLTR stock has taken a hit in the past three months, shedding 9.3%. Returns have been negative and continue to weaken amidst concerns of rising input costs from inflation and competition.
Revenues rose a modest 3% in its latest quarter. Demand for pandemic-related supplies has slowed, however, it has been offset somewhat by sales of discretionary goods. Management guided its earnings to fall in the $5.80 to $6.05 range compared to the $6.20 consensus.

Accelerating cost pressures from freight and wages will continue to weigh in on Dollar Tree, especially in light of its fixed $1 price point, which restricts its ability to absorb high costs through price increases.
Falling Knife Stocks: Take-Two Interactive Software Inc. (TTWO)

Take-Two Interactive is arguably one of the strongest video game publishers with the most powerful proprietary technology in the market. It generated incredible results in fiscal 2021 and has a robust pipeline of video games in the coming years. However, of-late TTWO stock has shed close to 20% of its value due to a delay in two of its top titles.
In its most recentearnings call chief executive Strauss Zelnick stated that: “For the year, we are reiterating our outlook, as there has been some movement in our release schedule, including two of our immersive core titles shifting to later in fiscal 2022 than contemplated by our prior guidance.”
As a result, its net bookings will be down to $3.2 billion to $3.3 billion versus the consensus of $3.43 billion.
Penn National Gaming (PENN)

Penn National Gaming is one of the leading casino operators in the U.S. Moreover, it has also established a strong presence in i-gaming and sports betting through its investment in Barstool Sports.
The company has delivered tremendous earnings results, posting a 407.1% year-over-year growth in revenues. Despite these results, PENN stock has lost 36.5% of its value in the past six months.

7 Tech Stocks to Avoid Until They Turn Things Around
The drop in its price is largely due to the broad-based correction for i-gaming stocks. Between April 2020 and March 2021, Penn stock had shot up by over 900%. Therefore, the current pullback doesn’t seem odd. However, these headwinds will not impact PENN stock for a long time and could recover soon.
Falling Knife Stocks: La-Z-Boy Incorporated (LZB)

Furniture producer La-Z-Boy recently posted blow-out earnings results in its fourth quarter. It showed revenue of $519.5 million, representing a healthy 41% increase from the prior-year period. However, the management’s warnings about supply chain issues and its margin volatility make LZB stock a risky investment in the near term.
LZB stock is down a considerable 17.4% in the past three months. It faces considerable risks regarding high demand levels, production ramp-ups not addressing the backlog and high margin volatility. Management expects these elements to have a negative on its profit margins in the short run.
However, with demand trends looking strong, things should improve drastically in the long run as the company works through its backlog.
Clorox (CLX)

Clorox benefited heavily from the obsessive cleaning habits stoked by the Covid-19 pandemic. As a result, sales were at elevated levels for the company throughout last year. However, those tailwinds are fading away as cleaning habits return to pre-pandemic levels. Hence, CLX stock has declined 10.4% in the last three months, even with the delta variant surge occupying the headlines.
Clorox recently reported its fourth-quarter results, where its revenues dropped by 9% on a year-over-year basis. Sales were impacted by an unfavorable price mix but slightly offset by cost-saving initiatives.

Moreover, its health and wellness category was greatly affected by lower shipments of disinfecting and clean products. The company’s full-year revenue is likely to fall in a range of $6.90 billion-$7.19 billion versus the consensus of $7.45 billion.
All that points to a scenario where CLX stock will remain under duress for the foreseeable future.
Falling Knife Stocks: Vertex Pharma (VRTX)

Shares of biotech leader Vertex Pharmaceuticals have been a beating as its pipeline hasn’t produced any big wins off-late.
In June, the company revealed that its second attempt at treating a rare lung disease wasn’t much improvement over the first trial. Therefore, it would be mostly reliant on its revenues from a small population of cystic fibrosis patients.
Then the company announced the discontinuation of the clinical program for VX-864, a treatment for the genetic disorder alpha-1 antitrypsin. This could have been a major revenue generator for the company, considering the market’s void for its testing.
However, despite these challenges, VRTX has a healthy growth runway ahead and could pick up the pace soon.

2021-08-11 00:00:00+00:00,"Subdued Growth No Barrier To Dollar Tree, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:DLTR) Price",DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/subdued-growth-no-barrier-to-dollar-tree-inc.s-nasdaq%3Adltr-price-2021-08-11,,,"It's not a stretch to say that Dollar Tree, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:DLTR) price-to-earnings (or ""P/E"") ratio of 16.3x right now seems quite ""middle-of-the-road"" compared to the market in the United States, where the median P/E ratio is around 18x. Although, it's not wise to simply ignore the P/E without explanation as investors may be disregarding a distinct opportunity or a costly mistake.
Dollar Tree certainly has been doing a good job lately as it's been growing earnings more than most other companies. One possibility is that the P/E is moderate because investors think this strong earnings performance might be about to tail off. If not, then existing shareholders have reason to be feeling optimistic about the future direction of the share price.
NasdaqGS:DLTR Price Based on Past Earnings August 11th 2021
Want the full picture on analyst estimates for the company? Then our free report on Dollar Tree will help you uncover what's on the horizon.
Does Growth Match The P/E?
In order to justify its P/E ratio, Dollar Tree would need to produce growth that's similar to the market.
If we review the last year of earnings growth, the company posted a terrific increase of 83%. Still, incredibly EPS has fallen 12% in total from three years ago, which is quite disappointing. Therefore, it's fair to say the earnings growth recently has been undesirable for the company.
Turning to the outlook, the next three years should generate growth of 9.4% per annum as estimated by the analysts watching the company. With the market predicted to deliver 12% growth each year, the company is positioned for a weaker earnings result.
With this information, we find it interesting that Dollar Tree is trading at a fairly similar P/E to the market. It seems most investors are ignoring the fairly limited growth expectations and are willing to pay up for exposure to the stock. These shareholders may be setting themselves up for future disappointment if the P/E falls to levels more in line with the growth outlook.
The Final Word
While the price-to-earnings ratio shouldn't be the defining factor in whether you buy a stock or not, it's quite a capable barometer of earnings expectations.
Our examination of Dollar Tree's analyst forecasts revealed that its inferior earnings outlook isn't impacting its P/E as much as we would have predicted. When we see a weak earnings outlook with slower than market growth, we suspect the share price is at risk of declining, sending the moderate P/E lower. This places shareholders' investments at risk and potential investors in danger of paying an unnecessary premium.
And what about other risks? Every company has them, and we've spotted 1 warning sign for Dollar Tree you should know about.

In this Fool Live video clip, recorded on July 16, I discuss my largest REIT positions with my colleague Brian Withers and our chief growth officer Anand Chokkavelu, and why I love each one for the long term.
10 stocks we like better than Empire State Realty Trust
When our award-winning analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, Motley Fool Stock Advisor, has tripled the market.*
They just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now... and Empire State Realty Trust wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys.
See the 10 stocks
*Stock Advisor returns as of June 7, 2021
Matt Frankel: I'm the real estate guy, so not surprisingly, my biggest category is real estate investment trusts, or REITs. I have seven of them in my top 20. They are Digital Realty Trust (NYSE: DLR), STORE Capital (NYSE: STOR), Empire State Realty Trust (NYSE: ESRT), Healthpeak Properties (NYSE: PEAK), Tanger Outlets (NYSE: SKT), Realty Income (NYSE: O), and Ryman Hospitality Properties (NYSE: RHP). If you haven't heard of any of those or don't know what they do, you're probably not alone. This is where Brian and my investing styles differ. Most of his stocks needed no explanation. Everyone knew what they were.
What does these do? Just two-sentence explanations of each ones. Empire State Realty, this is my largest stock position by dollars. It's a little bit more than, I think, 7% of my portfolio right now, a little bit more than that. They own the Empire State Building, they own some other office real estate in the Manhattan and surrounding areas. One big differentiator, other than the fact that they own such an iconic property, is that they also operate the famous observatory on top of the Empire State Building, which is still a must-do tourist attraction in New York City. That's an absolute cash machine. In normal times, they make about 25% of their income from that, even though it makes up something like 3% of their square footage. Cash machine business. Most office REITs don't have anything comparable in their portfolio.
Realty Income, they are the first realty I ever bought. They own over 6,500 freestanding properties, mostly leased to non-discretionary retailers. Think of companies like Walgreens, that's, I think, their biggest tenant. They own a lot of Dollar Store properties, wholesale clubs like BJ's and Costco and things like that. They own those kind of properties, freestanding meaning one tenant. They have a great track record of performance. Does the slideshow look better now?
Anand Chokkavelu: It does.
Frankel: Awesome. Sorry, Tim. Anyway, Realty Income. There we go. They have a great track record of performance. They've been a public company since 1994. Since that time, they have delivered annualized returns greater than 15% a year, which is an excellent track record over 27 years. They're a Dividend Mristocrat. They actually have a trademark on the term ""the monthly dividend company,"" which a lot of people don't realize. That is there if you talked about the monthly dividend company, that is Realty Income. Great performance, great income. Digital Realty data center. This is the only one that Brian said he might buy.
Brian Withers: I do own Square.
Frankel: Okay. Well, out of the REITs. I call them a different kind of tech stock. They own the actual properties that house the servers and networking equipment that Brian's stocks rely on pretty much. Great way to play that to real estate, Tanger Outlets. If you live in a coastal area, you've probably seen a Tanger Outlets property. I know there's one close to Anand in the National Harbor.
Chokkavelu: Yeah.
Frankel: Yeah, they're the biggest stand-alone outlet shopping company. Simon Property Group (NYSE: SPG) is the leader in the space, Tanger is the biggest one that only focused on outlets. I'll make the slide deck available to whoever wants it, by the way. Store Capital, very similar business to Realty Income. Newer, it got on my radar because it's the only read that Warren Buffett invest in through Berkshire Hathaway. Healthpeak properties. Healthcare is a great growth trend long term. They invest in life science properties and medical offices and a smaller concentration in senior housing. Great growth market. The healthcare industry is just going to explode over the next few decades.
Finally, and then I'll shut up and see what these guys think about them, Ryman Hospitality Properties. It's probably my favorite hotel company in the world. They own five massive hotels all under the Gaylord brand name. If you're a national person, you know of the Ryman Auditorium where the company gets its name, the Grand Ole Opry, and the Ole Red restaurant chain that was opened in partnership with Blake Shelton. They own that as well. Not a total real estate play there, actually, they have a restaurant business and the Gaylord, I believe the full actually had an event at the Gaylord at one point.
Chokkavelu: Yes.
Withers: They did.
Frankel: What are your thoughts on all of these? Are these really ""OK boomer"" stocks or are they appropriate retirement investments?
Withers: I guess, when I looked at the financials for these, they operate very differently than my tech stocks and software stocks. They are buying infrastructure, whether it's land, property, building buildings, various places along. Then they use those assets and those physical buildings to then make money. One of the things that I look at as I look at companies, is I want them to be more virtual. Companies with more distribution centers or manufacturing centers or have to have retail outlets to capture revenue are not things that I'm interested in, and that's exactly how these guys make money, right? They have buildings and that's how they make money. But the Digital Realty one is one that piqued my interest very much and it ranked pretty high on my scores as well.

2021-07-29 00:00:00+00:00,First Week of September 17th Options Trading For Dollar Tree,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/first-week-of-september-17th-options-trading-for-dollar-tree-2021-07-29,,,"Investors in Dollar Tree Inc (Symbol: DLTR) saw new options become available this week, for the September 17th expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the DLTR options chain for the new September 17th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $95.00 strike price has a current bid of $2.46. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $95.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $92.54 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of DLTR, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $99.31/share today.
Because the $95.00 strike represents an approximate 4% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 68%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 2.59% return on the cash commitment, or 18.90% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Dollar Tree Inc, and highlighting in green where the $95.00 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $100.00 strike price has a current bid of $4.00. If an investor was to purchase shares of DLTR stock at the current price level of $99.31/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $100.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 4.72% if the stock gets called away at the September 17th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if DLTR shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Dollar Tree Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing DLTR's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $100.00 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $100.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 50%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 4.03% boost of extra return to the investor, or 29.40% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.
The implied volatility in the put contract example is 34%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 31%.
Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $99.31) to be 28%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

One of the key inputs that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 205 days until expiration the newly available contracts represent a possible opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the DLTR options chain for the new February 2022 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $95.00 strike price has a current bid of $6.00. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $95.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $89.00 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of DLTR, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $98.98/share today.

Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Dollar Tree Inc, and highlighting in green where the $95.00 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $100.00 strike price has a current bid of $7.65. If an investor was to purchase shares of DLTR stock at the current price level of $98.98/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $100.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 8.76% if the stock gets called away at the February 2022 expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if DLTR shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Dollar Tree Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing DLTR's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $100.00 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $100.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 47%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 7.73% boost of extra return to the investor, or 13.76% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.
The implied volatility in the put contract example is 28%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 29%.
Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $98.98) to be 28%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

2021-07-24 00:00:00+00:00,3 Supercharged Stocks That Can Make You Richer in the Second Half of 2021 (and Beyond),DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-supercharged-stocks-that-can-make-you-richer-in-the-second-half-of-2021-and-beyond-2021,,,"The U.S. equity market has recently come under significant pressure, as a surge in COVID-19 cases seems to have shaken the hopes of a rapid global economic recovery. On July 19, the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped by 2.1%, the S&P 500 by 1.6%, and the Nasdaq Composite by 1.1% from their previous closing prices.
This downturn is seen by some investors as a warning of an impending market crash. However, it is impossible to time a market crash accurately. Instead, investors should focus on using these pullbacks as entry opportunities for picking shares of resilient companies that are driven by strong secular tailwinds. Here are three supercharged stocks that have the potential to give solid returns to retail investors in the second half of 2021.
Image source: Getty Images.
1. PayPal
PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL) is a major player in the global digital payments market, which is estimated to grow from a $5.44 trillion value in 2020 to be worth $11.29 trillion in 2026.
The company has expanded its product offerings to include several cashless payment services for customers, such as digital wallets (PayPal and Venmo), ""buy now pay later,"" QR codes, and payment cards as well as capital loans, inventory management, fraud detection, and risk management services for merchants. Recently, the company introduced a point-of-sale system called Zettle for small businesses in the U.S., enabling better management of offline and online transactions. The company has also launched features for PayPal and Venmo users to buy, hold, and sell cryptocurrency.
The number of PayPal's active accounts (its customer base) was up 21% year over year to 392 million at end of the first quarter (ending March 31, 2021). The company has reported a trailing-12-month (TTM) revenue of $22.87 billion and total payment volume of over $1 trillion.
As more customers and merchants join the platform, PayPal's network effect (the value and utility of the platform grow as more users opt for these services) becomes stronger. In fact, a survey showed that customers were 54% more likely to make a purchase if a business accepts PayPal, especially in unfamiliar situations. This network effect and customer trust are difficult-to-disrupt barriers to entry for new fintech competition. PayPal also enjoys significant pricing power. Recently, the company hiked the merchant rates in the U.S., citing significantly higher conversion rates and the purchasing probability of its customers.
PayPal is currently trading at over 15 times TTM sales, which is not cheap. However, considering its dominant position in a rapidly growing digital payments market, the company offers an attractive risk-reward proposition to retail investors even at these valuation levels.
2. Realty Income
Realty Income (NYSE: O) is the ninth-largest real estate investment trust (REIT) in the world. The company is also a leader in a highly fragmented global triple-net lease REIT space (triple-net leases involve tenants paying taxes, insurance, and maintenance) with an estimated market value close to $12 trillion.
With over 6,600 properties leased to a highly diversified customer base, including Walgreens, 7-Eleven, Dollar General, Dollar Tree, and FedEx, Realty Income can prove to be a highly resilient investment in any economic condition. Approximately 58% of its clients are investment-grade, and 96% of rent collections are not affected by economic uncertainties and e-commerce pressures. Despite the company being affected by a slump in business from fitness centers and movie theaters, Realty Income managed to clock an occupancy rate of 98% in the first quarter (ending March 31, 2021).
This Dividend Aristocrat has paid dividends for 51 years in a row. The company has also raised its dividend for 95 consecutive quarters and currently pays a dividend yield of 4.12%. Realty Income reported a dividend payout ratio (dividends divided by adjusted funds from operations, or AFFO) of 83% in 2020. So, the company has the financial flexibility to continue paying dividends in future months.
The recently announced all-stock acquisition of VEREIT (NYSE: VER), a commercial property-focused REIT, has further improved the investment case for Realty Income. Priced at close to $11 billion, this deal is expected to add 10% to Realty Income's AFFO per share in the first year after the acquisition. The combined company is expected to generate cost savings and refinance VEREIT's upcoming debt at lower interest rates by leveraging Realty Income's strong balance sheet. The combined company is also expected to spin off its office portfolio in a separate and publicly traded REIT. Divestitures have generally been known to create value for existing shareholders.
Against this backdrop, Realty Income seems well-positioned to create significant wealth for retail investors in 2021.
3. Zscaler
Shares of leading cloud-based cybersecurity company Zscaler (NASDAQ: ZS) have gained over 90% in the past year thanks to the increasing global prevalence of cybercrime and rising demand for its Zero Trust cybersecurity solutions. Zero Trust is a security architecture in which enterprises do not trust anyone, and instead authenticate each user inside and outside their networks before granting access to their resources.
Zscaler is currently targeting an addressable market worth $72 billion, which includes cybersecurity services for employee devices in large enterprises as well as for applications in the public cloud. With TTM revenue of $602 million, the company has hardly scratched the surface of its targeted market opportunity.
Zscaler has reported over 35% year-over-year revenue growth for the past 12 quarters, making it one of the fastest-growing cloud-based cybersecurity companies on the market. In the third quarter (ending April 30, 2021), revenue soared 60% year over year to $176.4 million, and non-GAAP net income jumped by 77.7% year over year to $21.4 million. The company's remaining performance obligations or noncancelable future revenue arising from existing contractual relationships was up 85% year over year to $1.2 billion at the end of the third quarter. This metric implies significant revenue visibility and the continuation of strong revenue growth rates in the coming quarters.
Zscaler's dollar-based net retention rate was a solid 126% in the third quarter, highlighting the company's robust customer retention trends and success of its land-and-expand strategy. In addition to its core cloud-based user security solution called Zscaler Internet Access and core cloud-based private data and application security solution for the public cloud called Zscaler Private Access, the company also sells several add-on services to its clients. The company aims to expand its portfolio by acquiring the leading cloud infrastructure entitlement management player, Trustdome, as well as active defense and deception technology player, Smokescreen Technologies. These portfolio additions will add new clients and bolster the company's cross-selling success story.
Zscaler is currently trading at just over 50 times TTM sales, which is pretty expensive compared to the median software industry multiple of 3.68. However, with a well-capitalized balance sheet carrying a cash balance of $1.4 billion and a solid revenue growth trajectory, this cybersecurity company still is an attractive pick for long-term retail investors.

2021-07-16 00:00:00+00:00,"Is Now An Opportune Moment To Examine Dollar Tree, Inc. (NASDAQ:DLTR)?",DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/is-now-an-opportune-moment-to-examine-dollar-tree-inc.-nasdaq%3Adltr-2021-07-16,,,"Today we're going to take a look at the well-established Dollar Tree, Inc. (NASDAQ:DLTR). The company's stock received a lot of attention from a substantial price movement on the NASDAQGS over the last few months, increasing to US$118 at one point, and dropping to the lows of US$97.50. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Dollar Tree's current trading price of US$98.68 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Dollar Tree’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change.
Is Dollar Tree still cheap?
Good news, investors! Dollar Tree is still a bargain right now. According to my valuation, the intrinsic value for the stock is $126.25, but it is currently trading at US$98.68 on the share market, meaning that there is still an opportunity to buy now. Another thing to keep in mind is that Dollar Tree’s share price may be quite stable relative to the rest of the market, as indicated by its low beta. This means that if you believe the current share price should move towards its intrinsic value over time, a low beta could suggest it is not likely to reach that level anytime soon, and once it’s there, it may be hard to fall back down into an attractive buying range again.
What kind of growth will Dollar Tree generate?
NasdaqGS:DLTR Earnings and Revenue Growth July 16th 2021
Investors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to grow by a double-digit 18% over the next couple of years, the outlook is positive for Dollar Tree. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.
What this means for you:
Are you a shareholder? Since DLTR is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to increase your holdings in the stock. With an optimistic outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as financial health to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.
Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on DLTR for a while, now might be the time to enter the stock. Its buoyant future outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy DLTR. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the track record of its management team, in order to make a well-informed investment decision.
So while earnings quality is important, it's equally important to consider the risks facing Dollar Tree at this point in time. In terms of investment risks, we've identified 1 warning sign with Dollar Tree, and understanding it should be part of your investment process.

2021-07-08 00:00:00+00:00,August 27th Options Now Available For Dollar Tree,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/august-27th-options-now-available-for-dollar-tree-2021-07-08,,,"Investors in Dollar Tree Inc (Symbol: DLTR) saw new options begin trading today, for the August 27th expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the DLTR options chain for the new August 27th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $97.00 strike price has a current bid of $2.13. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $97.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $94.87 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of DLTR, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $98.45/share today.
Because the $97.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 58%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 2.20% return on the cash commitment, or 16.03% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Dollar Tree Inc, and highlighting in green where the $97.00 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $100.00 strike price has a current bid of $2.67. If an investor was to purchase shares of DLTR stock at the current price level of $98.45/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $100.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 4.29% if the stock gets called away at the August 27th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if DLTR shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Dollar Tree Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing DLTR's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $100.00 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $100.00 strike represents an approximate 2% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 54%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 2.71% boost of extra return to the investor, or 19.80% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.
The implied volatility in the put contract example is 41%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 36%.
Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $98.45) to be 29%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

2021-06-28 00:00:00+00:00,How The Pieces Add Up: FXD Headed For $67,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/how-the-pieces-add-up%3A-fxd-headed-for-%2467-2021-06-28,,,"Looking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at ETF Channel, we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. For the First Trust Consumer Discretionary AlphaDEX Fund ETF (Symbol: FXD), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $66.73 per unit.
With FXD trading at a recent price near $60.67 per unit, that means that analysts see 9.99% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of FXD's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are JetBlue Airways Corp (Symbol: JBLU), Thor Industries, Inc. (Symbol: THO), and Dollar Tree Inc (Symbol: DLTR). Although JBLU has traded at a recent price of $17.18/share, the average analyst target is 31.93% higher at $22.67/share. Similarly, THO has 24.98% upside from the recent share price of $111.56 if the average analyst target price of $139.43/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting DLTR to reach a target price of $116.33/share, which is 18.28% above the recent price of $98.35. Below is a twelve month price history chart comparing the stock performance of JBLU, THO, and DLTR:
Below is a summary table of the current analyst target prices discussed above:
NAME SYMBOL RECENT PRICE AVG. ANALYST 12-MO. TARGET % UPSIDE TO TARGET
First Trust Consumer Discretionary AlphaDEX Fund ETF FXD $60.67 $66.73 9.99%
JetBlue Airways Corp JBLU $17.18 $22.67 31.93%
Thor Industries, Inc. THO $111.56 $139.43 24.98%
Dollar Tree Inc DLTR $98.35 $116.33 18.28%
Are analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past. These are questions that require further investor research.

But in any diversified portfolio of stocks, you'll see some that fall short of the average. Unfortunately for shareholders, while the Dollar Tree, Inc. (NASDAQ:DLTR) share price is up 18% in the last three years, that falls short of the market return. In the last year the stock has gained 12%.
There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.
Over the last three years, Dollar Tree failed to grow earnings per share, which fell 4.1% (annualized).
Given the share price resilience, we don't think the (declining) EPS numbers are a good measure of how the business is moving forward, right now. So other metrics may hold the key to understanding what is influencing investors.
It could be that the revenue growth of 4.5% per year is viewed as evidence that Dollar Tree is growing. In that case, the company may be sacrificing current earnings per share to drive growth, and maybe shareholder's faith in better days ahead will be rewarded.
You can see how earnings and revenue have changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).
NasdaqGS:DLTR Earnings and Revenue Growth June 23rd 2021
It's good to see that there was some significant insider buying in the last three months. That's a positive. That said, we think earnings and revenue growth trends are even more important factors to consider. This free report showing analyst forecasts should help you form a view on Dollar Tree
A Different Perspective
Dollar Tree shareholders are up 12% for the year. But that return falls short of the market. On the bright side, that's still a gain, and it's actually better than the average return of 1.8% over half a decade It is possible that returns will improve along with the business fundamentals. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Case in point: We've spotted 1 warning sign for Dollar Tree you should be aware of.
Dollar Tree is not the only stock insiders are buying. So take a peek at this free list of growing companies with insider buying.
