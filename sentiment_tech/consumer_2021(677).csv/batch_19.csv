2021-07-14 00:00:00+00:00,"If You'd Invested $1,000 in Adyen in 2018, This Is How Much You Would Have Today",EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/if-youd-invested-%241000-in-adyen-in-2018-this-is-how-much-you-would-have-today-2021-07-14,,,"eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY) and PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ: PYPL) were once considered inseparable. Even after spinning off PayPal in 2015, eBay continued to use PayPal's payment processing services.
That all changed in early 2018 when eBay decided to replace PayPal with a smaller Dutch competitor, Adyen (OTC: ADYE.Y), as its primary payment processor in a three-year transition. That announcement stunned PayPal's investors and thrust Adyen, then a private company, into the spotlight.
That June, Adyen capitalized on its growing fame with an IPO in Amsterdam. The fintech stock was priced at 240 euros ($282), opened at 400 euros, and is worth about 2,158 euros ($2,552) today.

If you had spent $1,000, or about 842 euros, to buy 3.5 shares of Adyen's mid-June 2018 IPO, your modest stake would be worth nearly 7,571 euros ($8,988) today (a 799% increase). Let's see why Adyen has continued to impress the bulls, and why the stock could have even more room to run over the next few years.
Smaller and simpler than PayPal and Square
Like fintech giants PayPal and Square (NYSE: SQ), Adyen charges flat fees to process payments. However, PayPal and Square generated roughly 26 times and 12 times as much revenue, respectively, last year.
Adyen's platform is also simpler. It doesn't provide cryptocurrency trades or peer-to-peer payments, as PayPal and Square do within their apps, and it doesn't offer any stock trading services like Square's Cash App. It also hasn't adopted Square's practice of putting Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) on its own balance sheet.
Adyen doesn't issue branded physical cards like PayPal and Square's Cash App. Instead, it helps merchants issue their own virtual payment cards, which function as branded mobile wallets.
Adyen generated most of its revenue in Europe last year, but it's gradually expanding across North America, Latin America, and Asia. That geographic diversification makes it more similar to PayPal than Square, which generated 97% of its revenue within the U.S. last year.
How fast is Adyen growing?
Adyen was founded 15 years ago, and its simpler approach to the fintech market attracted $266 million in three funding rounds as a private company.
Unlike many other fintech companies, Adyen generated stable profits for several years prior to its market debut. That's why it didn't issue any new shares during its IPO -- its shareholders merely sold their existing shares, equivalent to 13.4% of the company, to institutional investors.
If we examine Adyen's revenue, processed payment volumes, EBITDA, and net income growth over the past three years, we'll see why it attracted a stampede of bulls.

Data source: Adyen. YOY = Year over year.
Adyen's growth decelerated last year as the pandemic shut down many businesses. But this year, analysts expect its revenue and diluted EPS to grow 41% and 66%, respectively, as the pandemic passes. Next year, they expect its revenue and earnings to grow another 37% and 42%, respectively.
Adyen could eventually grow into its valuations
Adyen's growth rates are impressive, but the stock trades at more than 150 times this year's earnings and nearly 70 times this year's sales.
Those frothy valuations indicate lots of growth is already priced into Adyen's stock. PayPal is growing slower than Adyen, but its stock trades at about 50 times forward earnings and 14 times this year's sales.
Square is growing faster than Adyen thanks to its rising Bitcoin revenue, but it trades at 115 times forward earnings and six times this year's sales.
Investors shouldn't fret too much over the near-term valuations of growth stocks, but Adyen could underperform PayPal and Square -- as it did over the past 12 months -- until it grows into its valuations.
However, the global fintech market could still grow at a CAGR of 23.4% between 2021 and 2026, according to Market Data Forecast, so Adyen, PayPal, and Square could continue to attract investors with their different fintech strategies. Adyen in particular could remain an attractive choice for investors who think PayPal is too big and Square is too dependent on Bitcoin and the American market.

eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY) shareholders outperformed a booming market in the first half of 2021, with shares jumping 40% compared to the 14.4% increase in the S&P 500, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence.
That rally built on an earlier market-beating performance for the online marketplace, which trounced indexes in 2020, too.
Image source: Getty Images.
So what
Several things have gone right for eBay shareholders so far this year. A persistent demand spike for online commerce allowed sales volumes to soar in the first quarter, rising 24% through late March.
And eBay's marketplace is profiting more from those sales as the fees it charges sellers creep higher. As a result, Wall Street has been pleasantly surprised by its growth and profits thus far.
Now what
CEO Jamie Iannone and his team are predicting a growth slowdown ahead as the company laps some of the biggest growth spikes tied to the earlier phases of the pandemic last year. But eBay is still expecting to win market share in attractive niches, like sneakers and luxury watches, as the overall business expands and earnings rise.
Investor returns will be further amplified by eBay's aggressive cash-return policy that includes a meaty dividend and aggressive stock-repurchase spending. The marketplace's high margins give it room to boost both of these return categories in 2021 and beyond, even as growth slows from the soaring pace we've seen since early 2020.

Since the onset, the company has experienced a surge of new customers, and the newly acquired customers are sticking around.
The acquisition of millions of new customers has improved eBay's long-run prospects, and investors are noticing. Indeed, its shares are up by 38% year to date. If you haven't already, it may be time to start accumulating shares of eBay stock before buyers bid up the price even more.

Almost 200 million active buyers
Buyers are the key to eBay's business. Customers attract sellers who list more items on the platform. The increasing availability of items makes it more attractive for buyers and feeds the positive feedback loop. From the fourth quarter of 2019 to the first quarter of 2021, eBay acquired a net of 13 million active buyers. In all, eBay has 187 million active buyers.
To put that figure into context, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) Prime has 200 million members. Admittedly, the comparison is not as straightforward as it seems. Amazon probably has more active buyers who are not Prime members. Still, the comparison highlights the scale of eBay's buyer totals.
Additional sources of revenue
Unsurprisingly, sellers covet access to the nearly 187 million buyers on eBay. Management is well underway in capitalizing on this demand. It's doing so by increasing the tools available for sellers to advertise on its platform. In 2020, advertising revenue was $1 billion. What's more, management is adding to the toolbox open to marketers, which could further boost ad revenue.
In a glimpse of the potential for this source of sales, in 2020, Amazon reported over $20 billion in ad revenue.
Importantly, ad revenue usually comes with higher profits than the business overall. It is mostly an automated process with low costs beyond the initial investment in the technology to develop capabilities.
An asset-light, profitable business model
Unlike Amazon, eBay does not own or operate expensive fulfillment facilities. Instead, it allows buyers and sellers to arrange shipping options themselves. eBay mainly brings the two together and ensures fairness in dealings. For its services, eBay takes a percentage of sales. In the most recent quarter, its take rate was 10%.
The model scales efficiently and has led to solid profits. Over the last decade, eBay's operating profit margin has averaged 23.9%. Compare that to Amazon's of 2.2% in the same time. On its strategy, CEO Jamie Iannone said this:
Our results to date are very encouraging. Our underlying growth is accelerating, sellers and buyers are growing, and we are making progress in our pursuit to be the best global marketplace to buy and sell. Simply put, our strategy is working.
Inexpensive valuation
Data source: YCharts
eBay is trading at a relatively inexpensive value at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 17.62 compared to Amazon's 67.46. Certainly, Amazon's long-run prospects are more favorable, and it is addressing a much larger market size, but is that enough to justify a four-time valuation premium to eBay?
Regardless, eBay's favorable price, excellent profit margins, and solid prospects make it a good value for investors right now. eBay's management seems convinced of the stock's value and has committed to buying back $5 billion worth of shares in 2021.

2021-07-13 00:00:00+00:00,Behind the Corporate Push for a Federal Standard for Clean Energy,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/behind-the-corporate-push-for-a-federal-standard-for-clean-energy-2021-07-13,,,"More than 75 companies are currently lobbying lawmakers to enact a federal “clean energy standard” (CES), according to Axios. 
Companies such as Apple (AAPL), General Motors (GM), Unilever (UL), and Ebay (EBAY) have all joined forces to exert pressure on Congress to step up in creating a CES.
The open letter, sent to Capitol Hill, asks that lawmakers set a federal standard for clean energy, requiring power companies to supply zero-carbon electricity in drastically increased amounts. 
Zero-carbon power would allow for companies to operate at greatly reduced emission levels, aiding their efforts to curb carbon emissions. 
The letter said that “a federal clean electricity standard should achieve 80 percent carbon pollution-free electricity by 2030 on the pathway to 100% clean power by 2035,” according to Axios. 
The letter, and push, is backed by Ceres, a sustainable investment advocacy group, the Environmental Defense Fund, and other companies and institutions. 
Recent heat in the Pacific Northwest, attributed to global warming, has helped bring concerns of a warming planet to the forefront for many Americans, and Congress is taking notice. The Biden administration has signaled a push for a CES option to be included in the package being pushed by Democrats currently that includes energy, health, and childcare funding. 
""Millions of Americans are already feeling the impacts of climate change. From recent extreme weather to deadly wildfires and record-breaking hurricanes, the human and economic losses are profound,"" the letter said.
Investing in ESG with SPDR
For investors looking to capture the shifting push toward ESG within the financial and economic spheres, there do exist ESG ETF options. 
For example, the SPDR S&P 500 ESG ETF (EFIV) tracks the S&P 500 ESG Index, an index that selects from top companies that meet ESG criteria within the S&P 500, while also adhering to the sector weights of the S&P 500 Index. 
EFIV utilizes S&P DJI ESG scores to rank companies based on their sustainability. This score is derived from analyzing a thousand data points covering a variety of topics collected from companies and then asking roughly 120 questions, according to the S&P website. 
EFIV excludes companies involved in tobacco, controversial weapons, those that derive 5% or greater of their revenues from thermal coal extraction or generate power from coal, or that score low in United Nations Global Compact standards.
The top three sector allocations of EFIV are 30.11% in information technology, 14.43% in consumer discretionary, and 12.98% in healthcare, as well as several other smaller allocations.
EFIV has an expense ratio of 0.10%, making it one of the cheapest ESG ETFs on the market.

2021-07-12 00:00:00+00:00,Could Coupang Be a Millionaire-Maker Stock?,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/could-coupang-be-a-millionaire-maker-stock-2021-07-12,,,"Coupang (NYSE: CPNG), the largest e-commerce company in South Korea, went public in March. The 11-year-old company priced its IPO at $35 per share, and the stock started trading at $63.50.
But that initial enthusiasm quickly faded. The stock closed at $49.25 on the first day, and is now only worth about $40. Expectations for slower growth in a post-pandemic market, a mixed earnings report in May, and concerns about its soaring expenses and widening losses all dragged down the shares.
Image source: Getty Images.
Can Coupang impress the bulls again and generate millionaire-making gains over the next few years? Let's dig deeper to find out.
How Coupang conquered South Korea
Coupang was backed by big investors like SoftBank, Sequoia Capital, and BlackRock over the past decade, and their funds supported the expansion of its first-party logistics network across South Korea.
Today, Coupang's infrastructure spans across 30 cities, with a physical footprint of over 400 football fields. Approximately 70% of South Koreans live within seven miles of one of its logistics centers, which makes it tough for overseas challengers like Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) to crack the market.
Coupang's logistics network powers its Rocket Delivery service, which delivers packages within a single day. It also provides grocery deliveries via Rocket Fresh, restaurant deliveries via Coupang Eats, temp work opportunities on Coupang Flex, and streaming videos on Coupang Play.
Rocket Fresh and Coupang Play are exclusive features for Rocket WOW members, who also gain more shipping options, free returns for 30 days, and other perks for a flat monthly fee. WOW is similar to Amazon Prime, but Coupang hasn't revealed any exact subscriber numbers for the service yet.
How fast is Coupang growing?
Coupang's number of active customers grew 29% in 2019, 26% in 2020, and 21% year over year to 16 million in the first quarter of 2021.
South Korea has a population of 51 million, and Coupang estimates there are over 37 million online shoppers across the country. During last quarter's conference call, founder and CEO Bom Kim claimed its business remained ""under-penetrated in almost every age category."" That suggests Coupang sees a big opportunity to tap into a large addressable market of potential future customers.
Coupang's main competitors in South Korea include eBay's Gmarket, WeMakePrice, and Naver Shopping. Kim's statement suggests Coupang can continue growing by pulling shoppers away from those rivals.
In constant currency terms, Coupang's revenue rose 64% in 2019, jumped 93% to $12.1 billion on pandemic-related tailwinds in 2020, and grew 63% year over year to $4.2 billion in the first quarter of 2021. Analysts expect its revenue to rise 61% for the full year. Those are impressive growth rates for a stock that trades at less than four times this year's sales.
How profitable is Coupang?
Coupang is growing much faster than Amazon, but it's still burning money. Its net losses narrowed in 2019 and 2020, but nearly tripled year over year -- from $105 million to $295 million -- in the first quarter of 2021.
Coupang doesn't intend to break even anytime soon, since it's constantly expanding its ecosystem with new services. Instead, it claims its gross profit, which rose 92% in 2020 and 70% year over year in the first quarter of 2021, is a more ""meaningful measure"" of its improving scale.
Coupang expects its gross profit to ""increase over the long term"" as economies of scale kick in. As that happens, it might gradually balance out its operating costs with its revenue, which could pave the way toward sustainable profits. But that goal, which e-commerce giants like Amazon and China's JD.com eventually achieved after years of losses, remains a distant one for Coupang.
On the bright side, Coupang ended last quarter with $4.33 billion in cash and equivalents, so it can stay unprofitable for the foreseeable future without launching secondary offerings or accumulating more debt.
But can Coupang generate millionaire-making returns?
Coupang's growth rates and valuation suggest it could generate millionaire-making returns within the next few years.
However, its near-term growth relies heavily on its ability to increase its average revenue per active customer while expanding its market share in South Korea. Both of those efforts will require a lot of spending and loss-leading strategies, which could overshadow its robust sales growth.
If those domestic strategies hit a brick wall, Coupang could look overseas for more growth. It already expanded into Singapore shortly after its IPO, and it might enter other Asian markets over the next few years. However, challenging entrenched regional leaders like Sea's Shopee, the market leader in Southeast Asia and Taiwan, could be difficult and expensive to pull off.
I believe Coupang has a lot of growth potential, but it's still a very speculative investment. If it continues to lean into its strengths, tighten its grip on the South Korean market, then leverage its scale to narrow its losses, it could deliver multibagger returns for patient investors. However, I'd personally wait a few more quarters to see if those numbers are headed in the right direction.

The gains come despite the fact that the brick and mortar retail is opening up following Covid-19, with over half of U.S. adults now vaccinated and Covid cases on the decline. Now, e-commerce was gaining share from physical retail prior to Covid, and investors are likely betting that the pandemic is only likely to bolster the shift to online shopping, given the changes in consumer behavior through months of lockdowns. For example, research firm eMarketer estimates that U.S. retail e-commerce sales will grow by 13.7% this year and by 15% next year, with consumers expected to spend over $1 trillion via digital retail channels in 2022.
Within our theme, eBay (EBAY) stock has been the strongest performer, rising by about 39% year-to-date, driven by stronger demand growth and also due to its lower valuation multiples which have helped it capitalize on the broader rotation from high-growth to value stocks over the last few months. On the other side, Etsy (ETSY) a platform focused on handmade products, vintage items, and craft supplies, has been the worst performer within our theme, with its stock gaining just about 8%, amid weaker earnings guidance, as it faces a tough comparison with a solid pandemic year.
[4/6/2021] Will The Third Stimulus Check Help E-Commerce Stocks?
Our theme of E-Commerce Stocks – which includes U.S-based e-commerce platform players as well as logistics, and digital payment companies – is up by about 14% year-to-date, compared to the S&P 500 which is up by about 9% over the same period. The theme is also up by a solid 151% since the end of 2019, compared to a 26% return on the S&P 500. While investors have been rotating out of software and other high-growth stocks as the economy continues to open up following Covid-19, most e-commerce names in our theme have held up as investors likely expect e-commerce to continue eating into retail sales even post the pandemic. Moreover, it’s likely that a sizeable amount of the stimulus checks being mailed out as part of the $1.9 trillion Covid-19 rescue package will flow toward digital commerce spending, helping these companies. Within our theme, Wayfair (NYSE:W) a company that sells furniture and home goods online, has been the strongest performer with its stock up by about 43% year-to-date. On the other side, e-commerce bellwether Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has underperformed with its stock remaining roughly flat year-to-date.
[3/18/2021] E-Commerce Stocks To Watch
Our theme of E-Commerce Stocks includes U.S-based e-commerce platform players, logistics, and digital payment companies that stand to gain as shopping continues to move online. The e-commerce market has expanded significantly over the last year as the Covid-19 pandemic accelerated the shift away from brick and mortar stores to digital shopping, not just for discretionary items but also necessities. For perspective,  e-commerce as a percentage of overall U.S. retail sales jumped from around 16% in 2019 to almost 21% in 2020. [1] There’s a lot more room for the market to grow, considering that the total U.S. retail market stood at about $4 trillion in 2020. Our theme has outperformed the broader markets significantly, returning about 151% since the end of 2019, versus about 23% for the S&P 500. The theme is also up 11% year-to-date, compared to about 6% for the S&P 500. Below is a bit more about some of the companies in our theme and how they have fared.
Etsy (ETSY) an e-commerce platform that focuses on handmade products, vintage items, and craft supplies had a solid run through the pandemic, as gross merchandise sales, active buyers, and sellers on its platform soared. We think the company should continue to do well post the pandemic, as it could become the go-to platform for unique items that may not be available locally. The stock is up by about 388% since the end of 2019.
Wayfair (W), an e-commerce company that sells furniture and home goods, benefited from the trends of sheltering at home – which raised the demand for home improvement and the growing shift to e-commerce. The company is also building a very loyal base of customers, with more than two-thirds of its orders over its last quarter coming from repeat customers. The stock has gained a solid 248% since the end of 2019.
Carvana (CVNA) is an online used car retailer. Demand for used cars soared through Covid-19, as people look to avoid public transport. Moreover, customers shifted to e-commerce for buying cars as they remained averse to traditional in-person buys. The stock is up by about 208% since the end of 2019.
PayPal Holdings (PYPL) operates a worldwide online payments system that supports online money transfers. The stock has gained about 130% since the end of 2019, as people have preferred digital payment mediums through Covid pandemic. Moreover, the company’s move to allow users to buy, sell, and hold select Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin on its app has also helped its stock.
FedEx (FDX) stock is up by about 72% since the end of 2019. Although the company has seen some headwinds in recent years, as major customer Amazon doubled down on investments into its own logistics operations, the Covid-19 pandemic caused e-commerce shipments by the company to pick up. E-commerce should remain a tailwind, with the company expecting e-commerce package deliveries to more than triple to 111 million per day by 2026, up from about 35 million in 2019.
Amazon (AMZN), the e-commerce pioneer, saw demand for both its cloud computing business – Amazon Web Services – and its core online retail business soar through the pandemic, with revenue jumping by a solid 38% last year to about $386 billion. Amazon stock is up by about 67% since the end of 2019.

2021-07-11 00:00:00+00:00,These Stocks Have Trounced the S&P 500 in 2021 and Have More Room to Run,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/these-stocks-have-trounced-the-sp-500-in-2021-and-have-more-room-to-run-2021-07-11,,,"Investors were treated to a rally in the first half of the year, with the S&P 500 surging higher by 16%. That's an unusually high jump for any period, but especially following the 16% increase that indexes logged in 2020.
The rally has generated much bigger gains for a few businesses that are capitalizing on major shifts in consumer spending patterns. CarMax (NYSE: KMX), RH (NYSE: RH), and eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY) stocks, in fact, have each more than doubled the 2021 return for the wider market so far this year. Let's look at why those rallies might just be getting started.
eBay's light operating model
There's no shortage of places investors can go to gain exposure to the e-commerce bonanza that the pandemic pushed into a higher gear. That list includes national retailers like Target, which are getting profitability lifts from their multi-channel selling platforms.

eBay is a solid bet on the industry for different reasons. The marketplace doesn't maintain huge warehouses of its own inventory, choosing instead to simply connect sellers with buyers. That setup allows it to benefit from rising demand (volume was up 29% last quarter) while maintaining industry-thumping margins (operating income is routinely over 20% of sales).
TGT Operating Margin (TTM) data by YCharts
That profit figure might expand more over the next few years as eBay finds new ways to add value to its service, including through payment processing and advertising. And its performance through the pandemic, with its active buyer pool swelling to 185 million, gives it a great market share position heading into the post-pandemic period.
CarMax's pricing power
CarMax today is benefiting from some unusually positive trends in the used car industry. Consumer spending is surging thanks to pent-up demand, and that spike allowed unit sales to jump 31% this past quarter as compared to the record set two years earlier (before the pandemic struck). Prices are rising, too, thanks to low supply and rising prices for new cars.
These shifts imply a strong fiscal year ahead for CarMax, but investors have even better reasons to like this stock. The company recently launched the biggest national e-commerce platform for online car shopping to give it a valuable lead in this arena. Management sees plenty of room for new store openings, too, with 10 slated for fiscal 2022.
That strategy should deliver roughly 10% annual sales growth if you believe CEO Bill Nash and his team. And it should translate into robust returns for investors in 2021 and beyond.
RH takes luxury to the next level
Luxury home furnishings specialist RH is having a good year. Management credited ""the strongest demand trends in our industry"" when it reported a 78% sales spike in the fiscal first quarter. Premium furnishing products are showing no signs of slowing, either, with sales likely to jump at least 35% from a strong base a year ago.
Yet, the bigger story from RH is its surging profitability, which is causing Wall Street to rethink what is possible from a furniture seller. Its operating margin blew past 20% of sales recently, with help from higher prices and strong demand for RH's portfolio of exclusive brands.
Management believes they can keep margins above 20% even after the current industry boom times end. We'll have to wait to know for sure, but RH's strong performance heading into the pandemic was a good sign. In any case, investors hoping for exposure to the home furnishings niche might consider focusing on the high end of the industry by owning a piece of this attractive growth business.

What goes around, comes back around
In the apparel retail world right now, the hot segment everyone is attempting to jump into is secondhand clothing. ThredUp (NASDAQ: TDUP) expects the used resale niche to become a $36 billion market this year, and forecasts that it will more than double to $77 billion by 2025, a 21% compound annual growth rate.
A growing number of teens are conspicuously aware of the impact their fashion choices have on the environment, and the circular economy that seeks to reduce waste and the use of resources resonates with them.
Yet there's also a disconnect between teens' environmental consciousness and their embrace of fast fashion, which consumes more resources, as those clothes are meant to essentially be disposable. Fast fashion eschews classics with staying power for on-trend styles that lead to quick turnover in wardrobes.
It's just such turnover that has helped fuel the rise in the resale business, which ThredUp contends will be the primary driver of the secondhand clothing market. Resale is forecast to grow threefold in the next four years, from $15 billion to $47 billion, while the traditional thrift and donation market will expand at a slower rate from $21 billion to $30 billion.

Everyone wants in
Resale is now a highly competitive space, with newer entries such as Poshmark (NASDAQ: POSH) and the RealReal (NASDAQ: REAL), and legacy contenders such as eBay and Mercari. But now, every retailer considers itself a reseller, too.
ThredUp at one point operated three brick-and-mortar stores. But it permanently closed them during the pandemic, and is now strictly an e-commerce play. However, in 2018, it began preparing for that possibility by developing what it calls a resale-as-a-service (RaaS) offering that allows major chains to offer its used clothes. Walmart, Macy's, and J.C. Penney are just some of its big retail partners.
Other retailers are striking out on their own. Etsy, for example, just acquired Depop for a whopping $1.6 billion, Levi Strauss launched Levi Secondhand, lululemon athletica and Nike opened their own e-commerce outlets, and even Gucci recently opened a high-end e-commerce consignment store.
According to ThredUp's report, 60% of retailers say they are already offering secondhand clothes to their customers or are open to the possibility of doing so.
After the disastrous year apparel retail just had, it's understandable why these companies want to glom onto the next hot trend, yet a lack of authenticity is likely going to make it more difficult for any of them to succeed.
And because the big retailers will doubtless treat resale as only a secondary source of revenue and customers, those projections for meteoric growth might not pan out.
Image source: Getty Images.
A threadbare opportunity
Here are four reasons why the resale market might not be as viable a business as it appears, even though there is certainly a segment of the market for whom used clothes are appealing.
Cannibalization. For the retail behemoths, offering a robust lineup of cheap used clothes risks cannibalizing sales of their full-price apparel. Consider how a number of retailers once put a lot of effort into growing secondary strings of outlet stores -- until they eventually realized that their off-price outlets were undercutting sales and brand value at their full-price locations -- and creating profitability problems. The used clothing business has similar potential.
Lack of inventory. The more retailers that enter the market, the more they will be competing for a limited amount of quality inventory.
Disposable fashion. Fast fashion's popularity means many of the clothes that are sitting in closets may not be durable enough to last for a second owner, and they're likely to have already fallen out of fashion.
Costly operations. The business of sorting, cleaning, prepping, and marketing for sale someone else's clothing is labor-intensive and expensive. Also, most retailers aren't equipped to handle the logistics of buying secondhand clothing.
Most of the leaders in the resale segment are not profitable. ThredUp reported first-quarter revenue that was up 15% year over year to $55.6 million. That was a record for the company, but it still booked an adjusted loss of $9.1 million for the period. The RealReal saw a 27% gain in total revenue to $98.8 million, but its adjusted EBITDA was a loss of $35.6 million.
Poshmark's earnings did turn positive on an adjusted basis from the year-ago period, but investors will have to wait to find out if that was a one-off event.
Pricey retreads
Last year, the pandemic left people a bit more wary of wearing other people's used clothing, and while that skittishness might fade as a sense of normalcy returns, the straight-line rise in secondhand apparel sales that has been predicted might not pan out.
Ultimately, the companies that dominate this niche are consumer goods players, even if the market is valuing them more like software companies. ThredUp trades for 13 times sales, Poshmark for 12 times sales, and The RealReal at almost 6 times sales. And given that analysts are still forecasting losses for the year for all three of them, those are expensive retail stocks.
Although for traditional retailers, partnering with an existing reseller is seen as the best solution for dealing with the problems resale creates, investors might be better off watching these stocks from the sidelines until there's a bit more clarity as to whether this fashion trend has legs or is just the latest fleeting fad.

In contrast to all that, I prefer to spend time on companies like eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY), which has not only revenues, but also profits. While profit is not necessarily a social good, it's easy to admire a business that can consistently produce it. Loss-making companies are always racing against time to reach financial sustainability, but time is often a friend of the profitable company, especially if it is growing.
eBay's Improving Profits
In the last three years eBay's earnings per share took off like a rocket; fast, and from a low base. So the actual rate of growth doesn't tell us much. As a result, I'll zoom in on growth over the last year, instead. Like a firecracker arcing through the night sky, eBay's EPS shot from US$1.76 to US$3.87, over the last year. Year on year growth of 120% is certainly a sight to behold. That could be a sign that the business has reached a true inflection point.
One way to double-check a company's growth is to look at how its revenue, and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins are changing. The good news is that eBay is growing revenues, and EBIT margins improved by 4.7 percentage points to 27%, over the last year. Ticking those two boxes is a good sign of growth, in my book.
In the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings, and revenue, over time. Click on the chart to see the exact numbers.

Are eBay Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?
We would not expect to see insiders owning a large percentage of a US$48b company like eBay. But we do take comfort from the fact that they are investors in the company. Indeed, they have a glittering mountain of wealth invested in it, currently valued at US$1.8b. I would find that kind of skin in the game quite encouraging, if I owned shares, since it would ensure that the leaders of the company would also experience my success, or failure, with the stock.
Is eBay Worth Keeping An Eye On?
eBay's earnings have taken off like any random crypto-currency did, back in 2017. That sort of growth is nothing short of eye-catching, and the large investment held by insiders certainly brightens my view of the company. The hope is, of course, that the strong growth marks a fundamental improvement in the business economics. So yes, on this short analysis I do think it's worth considering eBay for a spot on your watchlist. It's still necessary to consider the ever-present spectre of investment risk. We've identified 2 warning signs with eBay , and understanding these should be part of your investment process.

2021-07-07 00:00:00+00:00,2 Stocks I Just Bought More Of,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/2-stocks-i-just-bought-more-of-2021-07-07,,,"The first half of 2021 was a strong one for the overall stock market, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite benchmark indices producing total returns of 14.1%, 16.5%, and 14.2%, respectively. However, the rally hasn't exactly been universal – for the most part, value stocks have outperformed and high-growth stocks have lagged the market.
With that in mind, it's a smart idea for long-term investors to look for bargains in their favorite companies when a certain part of the market takes a hit, so that's what I've been doing recently. Two stocks in particular that I've been adding shares to my positions recently include MercadoLibre (NASDAQ: MELI) and Boston Omaha Corporation (NASDAQ: BOMN). Here's why I'm confident enough to double down on them, even though both have underperformed the market so far in 2021.
Image source: Getty Images.
Massive untapped potential
MercadoLibre is often referred to as the Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN) of Latin America, and for good reason. It operates an e-commerce platform that has a dominant presence in several key markets in the region, such as Brazil and Argentina. And the business is thriving – MercadoLibre recently reported gross merchandise volume (GMV) growth of 114% year over year in the first quarter. Over $6 billion in products were sold on the platform in the first three months of 2021.
Remarkably, this is the less impressive of the two major components to MercadoLibre's business. It also operates a payment platform known as MercadoPago, which processed $14.7 billion of payments in the first quarter, which was a 129% growth rate over the same quarter in 2020.
One thing investors need to keep in mind is the massive market potential. Many of MercadoLibre's core markets are in much earlier stages of e-commerce adoption than the United States. And although the growth has been very impressive, it's worth pointing out that MercadoLibre's marketplace sales volume is roughly 4% of Amazon's and Mercado Pago's payment volume is about 6% of PayPal's (NASDAQ: PYPL). In a nutshell, this isn't just investing in the ""Amazon of Latin America"" as you'll often hear MercadoLibre referred to. It's like investing in the Amazon, PayPal, and maybe even the eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY) of Latin America at much earlier stages of their respective growth stories.
An emerging conglomerate that could be a big winner for early investors
Boston Omaha is one of those companies the market doesn't really know how to value. And that could be a very good thing for long-term investors.
Often compared to an early stage Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) because of its investment style, Boston Omaha is a conglomerate with three core businesses – billboard advertising, insurance, and rural broadband internet service. These businesses can have great economics, especially as they scale. For example, rural broadband requires little ongoing investment after the infrastructure is put in place, and already runs an 86% gross margin for Boston Omaha despite its relatively small size.
In addition, Boston Omaha invests in minority stakes in businesses, as well as in common stock positions, which is why its conglomerate style is more like Berkshire's than traditional operators. And it has been very successful. One particular home run is Boston Omaha's 5% stake in Dream Finders Homes (NASDAQ: DFH), a roughly $100 million position for which the company paid just $10 million a few years ago.
Finally, Boston Omaha is one of the only publicly traded SPAC sponsors you can invest in, and perhaps the only one whose SPAC has true needle-moving potential. Its Yellowstone Acquisition (NASDAQ: YSAC) is still looking for a company to take public, and regardless of what you think of the ""SPAC boom,"" one thing is certain – the economics are highly skewed in favor of the sponsor. If Boston Omaha finds a good target to take public through Yellowstone, the value creation potential is huge. With a market cap of less than $900 million, now could be a great time to get in on this ""baby Berkshire.""
Neither of these are low-risk
As a final thought, it's important to emphasize that I don't consider either of these to be low-risk stocks, especially in terms of short-term volatility. While I believe both offer excellent value at their current prices, they can (and probably will) take investors for quite a bit of a roller-coaster ride along the way. Invest accordingly.

2021-07-06 00:00:00+00:00,3 E-Commerce Stocks To Watch In July 2021,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-e-commerce-stocks-to-watch-in-july-2021-2021-07-06,,,"Are These 3 E-Commerce Stocks On Your Watchlist Right Now?
While 2020 was a banner year for e-commerce stocks, investors may want to keep an eye on the sector now. After all, with the broader stock market on a high now, investors could be looking for more undervalued stocks. Some would argue that e-commerce stocks fill this role given the year-to-date drop in most of their valuations. This could likely be the case as people assume that demand for e-commerce services could dip amidst the current reopening trade. However, companies in the digital retail business are not sitting idly by, to say the least.
We could look at the likes of e-commerce giants such as Alibaba (NYSE: BABA) for example. Now, BABA stock has been trading sideways for the past few months. Nevertheless, Alibaba is hard at work growing its tech and e-commerce empire now. For starters, the company’s Cainiao logistic arm is currently working with the local government in Hainan, China. Through this partnership, Cainiao will be leveraging its global logistics network and tech to establish Hainan as an e-commerce focused trade center. Moreover, the company also recently formed a new life services division, marking its entry into the on-demand local services and food delivery market.
Meanwhile, conventional e-commerce companies like eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY) are optimizing their operations. As of June 24, the company is selling an 80.01% stake in eBay Korea to Emart for $3 billion. According to CEO Jamie Iannone, this would see the formation of a juggernaut in the Korean e-commerce industry, creating “value for eBay shareholders”. Now, EBAY stock is currently looking at gains of over 35% year-to-date. Overall, the industry continues to improve its services even in the current reopening trade. On that note, here are three top e-commerce stocks to know in the stock market now.
Best E-Commerce Stocks To Watch In July
Etsy Inc. (NASDAQ: ETSY)
Peloton Interactive Inc. (NASDAQ: PTON)
Shopify Inc. (NYSE: SHOP)
Etsy Inc.
To begin with, we will be looking at Etsy. The New-York based e-commerce company primarily focuses on marketing handmade or vintage items as well as craft supplies. Additionally, Etsy’s digital shopping platform also offers a wide array of items spanning numerous categories. This includes but is not limited to jewelry, apparel, home decorations, and furniture. As an emerging name amidst the pandemic last year, Etsy continues to catch investors’ attention. Since its pandemic era low, ETSY stock is still sitting on gains of over 520%. Given its latest move, the company seems intent on keeping up its momentum.
As of last week, Etsy is planning to acquire Elo7, a leading e-commerce name in the Brazilian market today. Through a $217 million all-cash transaction, the company is getting access to Elo7’s operations in the local e-commerce market. In terms of scale, this adds up to a network of 1.9 million active buyers and 56,000 active sellers. The likes of which trade approximately 8 million unique items across the platform. According to Etsy CEO John Silverman, this would mark a strategic play by Etsy. Silverman argues, “The opportunity for Brazil’s e-commerce sector to grow faster than the U.S., we think, is very meaningful over time.”
By and large, Etsy seems to be aggressively bolstering its operations while expanding its addressable markets. This move comes less than a month after its earlier acquisition of fashion resale marketplace Depop back in early June. Given all of this, would you consider ETSY stock a top e-commerce stock to watch this week?

Peloton Interactive Inc.
Another name to consider in the e-commerce space now would be Peloton Interactive. In brief, the company develops and markets home exercise equipment and related exercise programs. Notably, Peloton currently operates the largest interactive fitness platform globally. According to the company, over 5.4 million members currently use its services. Through in-built displays on Peloton’s treadmills, consumers have a wide array of fitness classes to attend. Generally, this includes indoor cycling, Bootcamp, yoga, and strength training among others.
Arguably, Peloton offers consumers a one-stop and convenient means of exercising from home. Regardless of whether pandemic conditions improve, consumers could continue to rely on said services. With this in mind, PTON stock could be worth keeping an eye on in the current market. After having more than doubled in value over the past year, could it still have room to run? Well, investment bank Truist Financial (NYSE: TFC) seems to believe so. Namely, analyst Youssef Squali recently reiterated his Buy rating on PTON stock and raised his price target to $140. Squali cited Peloton’s “encouraging management commentary” and solid intra-quarter data as possible long-term growth drivers.
Analyst coverage aside, Peloton does not seem to be slowing down anytime soon either. Evidently, the company launched its Peloton Corporate Wellness (PCW) service. Simply put, PCW serves as a means to bring Peloton’s fitness offerings to businesses and organizational settings. According to Peloton, the service will be made available to organizations across the U.S., U.K., Canada, and Germany. All things considered, will you be adding PTON stock to your watchlist now?

Shopify Inc.
Following that, we have leading e-commerce company Shopify. In short, Shopify operates via its proprietary e-commerce platform, enabling online stores and retail point-of-sale systems. For a sense of scale, Shopify empowers over 1.7 million merchants across 175 countries today. The company also boasts existing e-commerce marketing partnerships with the likes of Google (NASDAQ: GOOGL) and Facebook (NASDAQ: FB). For investors looking to bet on the e-commerce industry now, SHOP stock could be a go-to. As it stands, the company’s shares are currently looking at gains of over 19% in the past month.
On the financial front, Shopify seems to be firing on all cylinders now. In its latest quarter fiscal posted back in April, the company saw green across the board. To highlight, Shopify posted mind-blowing year-over-year surges of 4,104% in net income and 3,781% in earnings per share. Besides, Shopify’s total revenue for the quarter more than doubled over the same time. CFO Amy Shapero cited the company’s “merchant-first business model” as a core contributor to Shopify’s current momentum.
In line with that, the company is currently making significant improvements to its current merchant-focused platform. As of last week, Shopify is implementing “the biggest upgrade” to its Shopify Liquid platform ever. New features and improvements include but are not limited to deep storefront customization, more efficient checkout services, and developer solutions. On top of all that, Shopify seems to be catering to developer-entrepreneurs. The company announced that developers who build for the Shopify App Store will now pay a 0% revenue share for the first $1 million earned annually on the platform. With Shopify refining its operations at this current pace, will you be watching SHOP stock?

2021-07-06 00:00:00+00:00,Why eBay Gained 15% in June,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-ebay-gained-15-in-june-2021-07-06,,,"What happened
Shares of eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY) gained 15.3% last month, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence. The rally, which was spurred by a series of developments, not only unwound a couple of sizable pullbacks the stock suffered earlier in the year, but carried it well into record-high territory.
So what
Don't look for any single catalyst. Rather, a series of bullish headlines all contributed to eBay's strong June performance.
That series began with the official announcement that eBay would offer guaranteed authentication of luxury handbags sold via its e-commerce platform. While that's an encouraging development in and of itself, it's also reflective of a more sweeping overhaul at the company that is allowing it to do something that bigger rival Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) still struggles to do: offer some guarantees about the quality of products sold by third parties on its platform.
Now, ebay.com offers certified refurbished electronics as well as certified refurbished home goods, among others -- and the latter category also launched less than a month ago.

Perhaps the biggest driver of eBay's share price boost in June was the ongoing streamlining of the entire company. There was news that regulators will not seek to prevent the sale of eBay's classified ads business to Norway's Adevinta (OB: ADE). Further, the company is selling most of its South Korean business to Shinsegae Group's E-Mart and search engine operator Naver. As is the case with the introduction of authenticated handbags, these planned divestitures reflect a bigger philosophical shift -- in this case, toward a tighter focus on its e-commerce and online auction platform.
Finally, though it was announced in May, eBay's foray into the non-fungible token (NFT) market likely contributed to last month's big gain, by virtue of putting the company closer to the center of new sorts of digital consumerism and speculation.
Now what
These moves (and others) are steps in the right direction for the company, which arguably hasn't made the most of how it differs from powerhouse Amazon -- its focus on the sale of one-of-a-kind goods that require custom-crafted listings. But eBay is starting to do a better job of that, and at the same time is shedding business lines and units that aren't adding enough long-term value to the company to justify holding on to them. Considering that context, this e-commerce company is a quality growth stock worth owning.
Would-be investors would be wise to exercise patience, however. With June's gains in the books, eBay shares are now up by 165% from last March's low and up by 50% from November's low... and they are showing some profit-taking pressure. Notable pullbacks from rallies have been the norm for a year now, and this rally isn't likely to yield a different result.

Investors are showing favor to its asset-lite business model, which has experienced a surge in customers and spending since the pandemic.
Shares are up nearly 39% year to date, and the stock continues hitting new record-highs. That has some investors raising the question: Is there room for eBay's stock to go even higher?
Image source: Getty Images.
Customers flocked to eBay
Like many other online platforms, eBay's business surged during the pandemic. From fourth-quarter 2019 to fourth-quarter 2020, active buyers increased by 11 million to reach 185 million. What's more, customer interest sustained even through economic reopenings in the first quarter of 2021, and eBay reached 187 million active buyers at the end of Q1.
It may be too soon to tell, but it looks like customers who joined during the pandemic are going to stick around for a while. eBay's platform gives buyers access to a unique mix of new and used items. You can simultaneously buy a new case of baby diapers and a used smartphone. Item selection and price savings are the twin pillars that attract buyers to eBay.
The organic customer interest during the pandemic allowed eBay to pull back promotional spending. Before the pandemic, I would regularly receive a promotional offer from eBay for 20% off my entire order with a max discount of $100. Additionally, I would sometimes receive $15 off any order of $75 or more. However, since the pandemic onset, these went away.
Reducing promotional spending allowed eBay to increase its transaction take rate, the amount of revenue eBay gets from a transaction, from 9% in Q4 2019 to 10% in Q1 2021.
Moreover, eBay leaves fulfillment and logistics for sellers to handle. The strategy is becoming a competitive advantage lately as several factors, including a shortage of truck drivers, have led to a rise in shipping costs.
Earnings can sustain at elevated levels
eBay recently closed the sale of Adevinta, which brought in $2 billion in cash. The development led eBay to raise its target for share buybacks this year from $2 billion to $5 billion. Furthermore, it entered an agreement to sell its businesses in Korea for $3 billion. Investors are cheering the sales because they will allow eBay to focus on its core business.
In all, the rise in active buyers, a decrease in promotional activity, and billions in share buybacks will go a long way in sustaining eBay's earnings per share (EPS). Still, management is guiding investors that EPS will decrease in the second quarter. However, that is more a result of tough comparisons from the same quarter last year.
The expected dropoff from pandemic-boosted earnings levels could be one reason why eBay's stock can be had at a relatively inexpensive forward price-to-earnings ratio of 17.7. So despite the run-up of eBay's stock price in 2021, there is room for it to go even higher from here.

E-commerce stocks had a historic year in the stock market last year. Well, it shouldn’t come as a surprise since many countries around the world were sent into lockdown. At that point, most shopping activities were conducted online. So, even those who were skeptical of online shopping initially must have been exposed to e-commerce platforms. This is of course due to the advancement of technology as well. Some company’s platforms such as Pinterest Inc (NYSE: PINS) even have augmented reality features that would allow you to have a rough idea of what you’re getting. 
The shift to online shopping has resulted in many emerging e-commerce companies. For example, we have Jumia Technologies (NYSE: JMIA) that aims to be the top online marketplace in the whole of Africa. Perhaps, this should not be overlooked as e-commerce is still a growing sector in Africa. Moreover, JMIA stock has already soared by more than 400% just within the past year. Now, if you are optimistic about the future of e-commerce, here’s a list of four top e-commerce stocks to watch in thestock market today
Best E-Commerce Stocks To Watch 
Etsy Inc (NASDAQ: ETSY)
eBay Inc (NASDAQ: EBAY)
Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (NYSE: BABA)
Chewy Inc (NYSE: CHWY) 
Etsy Inc
Let us start the list with Etsy. The company operates a marketplace where people globally connect, both online and offline to sell and buy goods. It also offers a range of seller services and tools that help entrepreneurs manage their businesses. As of now, the company’s seller services include Direct Checkout, Promoted Listings, Shipping Labels, and Pattern by Etsy. ETSY stock has risen by over 80% over the past year.  
On Monday, Etsy signed a definitive agreement to acquire Elo7, a privately held marketplace for unique, handmade items, ranked as a top 10 e-commerce site in Brazil. The Elo7 marketplace connects approximately 1.9 million active buyers with approximately 56,000 active sellers and currently has approximately 8 million items for sale. Hence, this deal would establish Etsy’s presence in Latin America, an underpenetrated e-commerce region. 
Etsy is not resting on its laurels. It also signed a definitive agreement to acquire Depop, a purpose-driven marketplace for unique fashion for $1.625 billion earlier in June. Depop is a community-powered marketplace to buy and sell unique fashion, with a mission to build the world’s most diverse and progressive home of fashion. It appears that 90% of Depop’s active users are under the age of 26. So, this could serve as a resale home for Gen Z consumers to the Etsy family. Given all these exciting developments, would you consider investing in ETSY stock?

Could These 3 Stocks Be The Next GameStop According To Reddit Investors?
eBay Inc 
Next, we have one of the industry leaders of e-commerce, eBay. Essentially, the company operates marketplace platforms that connect buyers and sellers globally. This includes its online marketplace at ebay.com and the eBay suite of mobile apps. So, you could buy, sell, and pay for items through various online and offline channels. eBay stock has been one of the better-performing stocks within the e-commerce space this year. It has climbed by over 35% year-to-date.
Just last week, the company announced the completion of the transfer of its Classifieds business to Adevinta in exchange for $2.5 billion cash and a 44% equity stake in Adevinta. This combination will hopefully create a leading global online classifieds business. In the long run, both companies will be primed to benefit from its combined portfolio that may offer additional value for its customers and shareholders.  
eBay also had an impressive first quarter to start the year with the highest revenue growth since 2005. Its revenue was $3.0 billion, up 42% on an as-reported basis. There was also increased activity on its platform. Annual active buyers grew by 7%, now at a total of 187 million. Meanwhile, its annual active sellers grew by 8%, for a total of 20 million. We can see that the company is firing on all cylinders as we recover from the global pandemic. With that in mind, would you add EBAY stock to your watchlist?

Alibaba Group Holding Ltd
Coming up next, we have one of the largest e-commerce companies in the world, Alibaba. The company’s technology infrastructure and marketing reach help merchants and brands to leverage the power of technology to engage its users, and customers to operate. As of today, its three main sites, Taobao, Tmall, and Alibaba.com boast hundreds of millions of users and host millions of merchants and businesses.  
Fundamentally, the company is as strong as ever. For its fourth-quarter fiscal 2021 earnings report, its revenue climbed to $28.6 billion, representing a 64% increase. Alibaba also reported 811 million annual active consumers in China which represents an 11% growth year-over-year. This is important because retaining and attracting active consumers would support the company’s business model. 
That said, it has not been a fantastic year for Alibaba this year. The company’s struggle this year was affected by the Chinese government. Alibaba was hit with a record fine of $2.75 billion earlier in April. However, the worst could be over for the company as the Chinese government is slowly shifting its focus to the company’s competitors. So, if you have missed the boat on BABA stock prior to this, could this be the classic buy-on-dip opportunity?

Chewy Inc 
Last on this list, we have an e-commerce company that specializes in pet products, Chewy. In essence, it provides pet food and treats, pet supplies and pet medications, and other pet-health products, as well as pet services. Pet lovers out there could access all these products through its chewy.com retail website, and its mobile applications. The company stock may have been trading sideways since the start of the year. But, it has still climbed by over 70% over the past year. 
In June, the company posted its first-quarter financial report that beat analysts’ expectations. Its net sales were $2.14 billion, growing 31.7% year-over-year. Meanwhile, its adjusted EBITDA came in at $77.4 million and its net income was $38.7 million. More importantly, Chewy added 600,000 active customers during the quarter which brings the number of active customers to 19.2 million. All in all, the company is growing in the right direction. 
Furthermore, Chewy also continues to innovate on their popular telehealth service, Connect with a Vet. May’s expansion includes the highly anticipated video consultation feature which allows pre-scheduling virtual vet consultation and extended hours of operation including weekends. With this, customers gain more accessibility to the company’s services and a better experience overall. With that in mind, would CHWY stock make your watchlist?

2021-06-30 00:00:00+00:00,EBAY Crosses Above Average Analyst Target,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/ebay-crosses-above-average-analyst-target-2021-06-30,,,"In recent trading, shares of eBay Inc. (Symbol: EBAY) have crossed above the average analyst 12-month target price of $69.00, changing hands for $70.49/share. When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher — if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.
There are 18 different analyst targets within the Zacks coverage universe contributing to that average for eBay Inc., but the average is just that — a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $57.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $82.00. The standard deviation is $7.545.
But the whole reason to look at the average EBAY price target in the first place is to tap into a ""wisdom of crowds"" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with EBAY crossing above that average target price of $69.00/share, investors in EBAY have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $69.00 just one stop on the way to an even higher target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table?

2021-06-30 00:00:00+00:00,Etsy Just Took a Big Step Into MercadoLibre's Biggest Market,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/etsy-just-took-a-big-step-into-mercadolibres-biggest-market-2021-06-30,,,"Etsy (NASDAQ: ETSY) just agreed to buy Elo7, a Brazilian marketplace for handmade items, for $217 million in cash. Etsy CEO Josh Silverman, who called Elo7 the ""Etsy of Brazil"", predicted the deal would help the online retailer ""establish a foothold"" in Latin America -- ""an underpenetrated e-commerce region where Etsy currently does not have a meaningful customer base.""
Elo7 connects approximately 1.9 million active buyers to 56,000 active sellers. Its marketplace offers about eight million items, the majority of which are made to order, across more than 40 categories. It generates over half of its gross merchandise sales (GMS) from ""special event and life moment"" categories, such as wedding, baby, home décor, and children's parties.
Elo7 is much smaller than Etsy, which ended last quarter with 90.7 million active buyers and 4.7 million active sellers. However, the acquisition will likely boost Etsy's international GMS, which surged 169% year-over-year last quarter and accounted for 42% of its total GMS.
Image source: Getty Images.
Etsy's expansion into Brazil makes sense, but calling Latin America an ""underpenetrated"" e-commerce market seems to ignore MercadoLibre (NASDAQ: MELI), the region's top online marketplace. MercadoLibre generated 56% of its revenue in Brazil last quarter, and the country is still the company's third-fastest-growing market after Argentina and Mexico.
Is Etsy underestimating MercadoLibre's strengths, or will it carve out a niche in Brazil's handmade market as it previously did in the U.S. against Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and eBay?
Elo7 vs. MercadoLibre
Etsy calls Elo7 a ""top ten"" e-commerce site in Brazil, but the privately held company has never publicly disclosed its revenue or market share estimates. But with 1.9 million active buyers, it's clearly much smaller than MercadoLibre, which ended last quarter with 69.8 million unique active users. MercadoLibre also provides a dedicated section for handmade products.
However, many analysts predicted Amazon would kill Etsy with the launch of its Handmade marketplace back in 2015 -- yet Etsy held its ground with its first-mover's advantage, simpler sign-up process, lower commissions, and more lenient rules regarding mailing lists and promotions.
At the end of 2015, Etsy served 24 million active buyers and 1.6 million active sellers. Since then, its numbers of buyers and sellers have nearly quadrupled and tripled, respectively -- so we shouldn't underestimate Elo7's ability to thrive in MercadoLibre's shadow, as Etsy did in Amazon's.
Furthermore, the Latin American e-commerce market is still underpenetrated relative to other regions. Fidelity International, BTG Pactual Research, and Euromonitor peg Brazil's e-commerce penetration rate at just 12.5%, compared to 27.3% in China and 20.3% in the U.S. Other Latin American countries have even lower e-commerce penetration rates.
Therefore, there might be plenty of room for Elo7, MercadoLibre, and other e-commerce companies to expand without trampling each other. The skeptics might claim Etsy will face an uphill battle -- especially since Amazon couldn't gain much ground in Latin America against MercadoLibre -- but Elo7's niche appeal as an artisan marketplace might help it avoid Amazon's fate.
What does this acquisition mean for Etsy's investors?
Elo7 marks Etsy's third major acquisition in less than two years. It bought Reverb in 2019 to expand into the online musical instruments space, and recently agreed to buy the U.K.-based fashion resale marketplace Depop.
Both of those acquisitions diversified Etsy's marketplace beyond handmade goods and expanded its overseas presence. Reverb's app is available in dozens of countries, while Depop serves more than 26 million active users in over 147 countries. Elo7 is another brick in that same wall.
We can clearly see the impact of the Reverb acquisition, along with the broader pandemic-induced boost in online shopping, on Etsy's overseas GMS growth in 2020 and the first quarter of 2021.

Etsy's GMS growth at its core marketplace could decelerate as the pandemic passes, but Depop and Elo7 could still buoy its overseas GMS growth and gradually reduce its dependence on the domestic market.
The key takeaways
Etsy's purchase of Elo7 faces clear risks. It will face fierce competition from MercadoLibre and other e-commerce marketplaces, while inflation -- which constantly reduces MercadoLibre's reported revenue -- could throttle its growth in U.S. dollars and reduce its overall benefit to Etsy's GMS growth.
That said, the acquisition is still a step in the right direction. If Elo7 carves out the same high-growth niche in Brazil as Etsy did in the U.S., it could grow significantly, boost Etsy's overseas GMS, and turn it into a major player in Latin America's growing e-commerce market.

2021-06-30 00:00:00+00:00,Why Warren Buffett Would Love Airbnb Stock,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-warren-buffett-would-love-airbnb-stock-2021-06-30,,,"When you think of the typical Airbnb (NASDAQ: ABNB) investor, Warren Buffett doesn't exactly fit the profile.
The Oracle of Omaha is a classic value investor , backing timeless businesses in sectors like banking and big-brand consumer goods. Buffett loves stocks like Coca-Cola that have been around for ages and seem virtually bulletproof.
With its high price tag and mobile-first business model, Airbnb may not look like a Warren Buffett stock, but if you scratch the surface, there are a number of reasons why the Berkshire Hathaway chief would actually love the hotel disruptor. Keep reading to see three reasons why.
Image source: Motley Fool.
1. The Airbnb brand
Remarking on Coca-Cola, Buffett once said, ""If you gave me $100 billion and said to take away the soft drink leadership of Coca-Cola in the world, I'd give it back to you and say it couldn't be done.""
You could probably say the same thing about Airbnb. The company pioneered the home-sharing industry in 2008 when its founders rented out air beds to host visitors for a conference in San Francisco. Today, its both a verb and a noun, synonymous with staying at someone else's home. It's common to hear travelers saying, ""I'm Airbnbing a place down the road,"" for example.
Though the company faces competition, most notably from Expedia's (NASDAQ: EXPE) Vrbo, it's well ahead of any of the wannabes in the home-sharing industry. Expedia no longer breaks out results for its home-sharing segment, but in 2019 Vrbo, which includes Homeaway and other home-sharing brands, reported $12 billion in bookings, while Airbnb posted $38 billion. Airbnb was also growing significantly faster than its chief rival back then.
Buffett loves big-brand stocks and considers brands to be a valuable source of competitive advantage. There's no doubt Airbnb would pass that test with flying colors.
2. It's got a wide economic moat
The most important factor Buffett considers when investing in a stock is whether the company has a wide economic moat, his chosen metaphor for a sustainable competitive advantage. Buffett believes a number of factors can create a moat, like a brand advantage, lower costs, economies of scale, or an innovative business model.
Once again, Airbnb meets the bar here. In addition to its brand, the company's two-sided marketplace helps lock in both hosts and guests through network effects. Since it can offer hosts the most potential guests and guests the most potential hosts, it figures to be the most attractive home-sharing marketplace to new users. Additionally, tools like reviews and ratings help lock in users, as hosts who have built up a history of favorable reviews will be reluctant to take their business elsewhere.
The marketplace model itself has also been shown to be a high-margin profit generator at scale, as the success of companies like Amazon, Etsy, and eBay demonstrates. Airbnb itself is now in the powerful position of collecting commissions on transactions on a platform it's already built, meaning the hard part is behind it. As it grows, profit margins should steadily move higher.
3. It's even got a float
Insurance is Buffett's favorite business because it enables him to collect premiums before they need to be paid out in claims. Buffett refers to this cash inflow as a ""float,"" and he can use that money to invest in other businesses.
Airbnb generally collects money upfront on bookings, which could take place months before the actual stay happens, giving the company a float of its own. It generally invests that money in short-term, high-quality bonds. This part of Airbnb's business is generally ignored, but it's not insignificant. The company finished 2020 with $2.2 billion in funds receivable -- or bookings yet to be collected -- and amounts held on behalf of customers. In 2019, before the pandemic sparked a raft of cancellations, it had $3.1 billion in amounts held on behalf of customers. That ""float"" helped it collect $86 million in interest income that year, and that should help make Airbnb a winner as interest rates rise again.
Though Buffett has said he avoids tech stocks and is often portrayed as being out of touch with current trends, he personally endorsed Airbnb's business in 2015, recommending it to attendees of Berkshire's shareholder meeting. In his annual letter, Buffett wrote, ""Airbnb's services may be especially helpful to shareholders who expect to spend only a single night in Omaha and are aware that last year a few hotels required guests to pay for a minimum of three nights. Those people on a tight budget should check the Airbnb website.""
While Airbnb's price tag might scare off most value investors, Berkshire's recent investments in tech companies like Apple and Amazon show that Buffett's holding company is willing to pay up for quality, especially for a company with a bright future ahead of it.
He'd likely find plenty to be pleased with in Airbnb.

*Stock Advisor returns as of June 7, 2021
This video was recorded on June 16, 2021.
Chris Hill: It's Wednesday, June 16, welcome to MarketFoolery. I'm Chris Hill. With me today, from the financial capital of the United States of America, it's Maria Gallagher. Good to see you.
Maria Gallagher: Nice to see you, too.
Hill: We've got home furnishings, we've got another sale at eBay, but we're going to start today with Roblox. Its shares are down eight after the company reported a drop in daily active users and a drop in spending. Although I will point out, the daily active users in the month of May on Roblox were 1% lower than April so yes, technically, that is a drop. Year-over-year, the numbers look good, there's some growth there, but I guess my first question is: Do you think this is an overreaction, or is the valuation of Roblox such that any dip in traffic is going to ding them like this?
Gallagher: I think both are true, so you have a lot of very high expectations for Roblox. I think that it's not surprising to me and it's not something that Roblox has shied away from. They have talked about consistently as the world reopens, as people get back and more and more to being physically near each other, we're expecting to go down a little bit. We want that to happen because we want people to be able to see each other again. But we think for the long term, this is something that people will continue to use. What's interesting is, like you said, their daily active users were down about 1%, but that hours engaged was actually up about 1%. The people who are using the platform are still using it and they're really dedicated to using it and spending more and more time on the platform.
Something else that I find really fascinating about Roblox is you have the people who use the metaverse, and then you have these new and interesting revenue streams that come from partnerships with record labels and brands. Zara Larsson, who is a Swedish singer, is hosting a launch party on Roblox. There's going to be a dance party. It's for her new album. It's going to take place in and around her Swedish lake house. It has games, challenges, and exclusive merchandise that people can buy with Roblox. So I think that that's an interesting thing. I'm excited to see how that goes over. I know there was a Lil Nas X concert that was hosted on Roblox that had over 33 million views. What we're seeing is you have the traditional ways that users have been monetized, and then this growth in this new and interesting way for users to be monetized in interactions with their favorite artists and partnerships with those record labels and even brands like Disney and things like that, which I think is pretty fascinating.
Hill: It never even occurred to me that Roblox would be hosting that type of event. Assuming they continue to do that, and by the way, why wouldn't they? How much of a growing threat does Roblox become to platforms that we traditionally think of as hosting those types of events? I'm thinking of a pretty wide range of platforms, everything from Facebook Live to Twitter Spaces more recently, or even just in the same way that iHeartMedia has hosted live concerts across radio stations and their online platforms as well.
Gallagher: Yeah. I think it's going to be really interesting to see in that it's so much more interactive than those traditional platforms, and people can feel much more like they're interacting with their friends and they can be in groups with their friends and interact with them because they know each other's avatars, as well as interacting with new people and getting more exclusive offerings. So I do think that that's really interesting. You have seen in their past quarter, there was a growth in users over 13, and I think that this is another way that they are trying to get more people onto the platform because a lot of their growth is going to come from expanding how many users are interested in the platform and getting out of that core demographic, which had been previously that 9- to 13-year-old demographic. I think this is another push to say, OK, well, if you like Lil Nas X or if you like Zara Larsson, come to this platform. Then if you are there, and you are like oh, this is actually more fun than I realized. I think it's an interesting way to attract new users and continue to monetize those existing users. So I think that's pretty exciting when I think about Roblox.
Hill: Last thing and then we'll move on. How expensive is this stock right now? Obviously, it's about 8% cheaper than it was yesterday. But is this one of those things where if you're looking at Roblox and thinking about the potential, not just for gaming, but also for the type of live events that we've been talking about, this is now a stock on your watch list. Is it really expensive still, or is it getting to the point where as long as your timeline is far enough in the future, now is a good time to buy?
Gallagher: It's definitely still quite expensive. I think it's trading at 42 times last 12 month's revenue and about 20 times next 12-month revenue. You're expecting a lot of growth, you have to see what those bookings look like. I think understanding how they can monetize users in a more effective manner, as well as how they can grow that platform because about 75% of children in the U.S. between the ages of 9 and 13 are already on the platform. You need to see that user growth outside of that core demographic and internationally to see them continue to grow those users in the way that I think is important for them to earn that valuation. I do think there are still some asterisks when you think about the company and how it's valued, so it is definitely still richly valued. But I think it's really interesting and I'm excited personally to see where it's going to go moving forward.
Hill: eBay is reportedly selling its South Korean unit for $3.5 billion, and yet shares of eBay are flat today. Is that because this is not finalized or because someone out there thinks they should be getting more for this? Because last time I checked, $3.5 billion appears to be roughly double the amount of cash that eBay already has on hand?
Gallagher: Yeah. I'm going to give credit where credit is due. I talked a little bit to [Motley Fool Canada analyst] Jim Gillies before I came on today about eBay. He knows a lot about the company, and so what he explained to me too is that this is something that eBay has been doing recently. StubHub was rolled out in February of 2020. There is talk for a deal for their classifieds group that should be done in the next couple of months as well, and then we have this deal happening as well. So I think this is something that people are not surprised that eBay is doing. It had Elliott Management coming in 2019, which is an activist shareholder group, and they're making some of those changes. You see them hiving off those noncore businesses. So I think that that's not a big shock, but I do think that this is interesting: that eBay in Korea is the third-largest e-commerce firm with a market share of about 13%. South Korea is actually the world's fourth-largest e-commerce market at all, with about 36% of the retail market is e-commerce, which I think is pretty fascinating. It seems like a good deal.
It seems like a good choice from eBay as they're continuing to focus on that core business and see what they can do. Because I would also like to say, I didn't realize quite how big that core business of eBay still is. They had gross merchandise volume of $27.5 billion last quarter, their annual active buyers are 187 million, which if we're comparing it to Etsy, there are only 82 million active buyers at Etsy. The annual active sellers at eBay are about 20 million compared to about 4 million on Etsy, which is, in my mind when you think about a marketplace, I go to Etsy so much quicker than I go to eBay. But I think that that's not how most people would react, and I think that the numbers speak for themselves. During quarter 1, the gross merchandise volume for trading cards on eBay was over $1 billion alone, just for trading cards. So they still have this massive core business, and so focusing on that, I think, is going to be pretty interesting for them moving forward. I think that in conclusion, maybe people aren't super surprised because this has now been the path eBay has chosen to take recently.
Hill: eBay is a fascinating company to me in the sense that I think for years now, it just hasn't gotten the respect it deserves. Maybe that's not an issue for the people who work there or for the people who are running it. Over the last five years, the S&P 500 has doubled. Shares of eBay have nearly tripled over the past five years. I'm glad you mentioned when you started your answer. Thank you for reminding everyone that eBay sold StubHub, a platform for tickets to live events. They basically sold it at the absolute perfect time. They sold right before the pandemic hit to Viagogo for about $4 billion. I think that was an all-cash deal. Yeah. I don't know. It's one of those things where people dismiss it, they think of it as just like, ""It's this legacy. It's from the dot-com days of the late '90s, like Yahoo! or AOL,"" or that sort of thing. The difference being that, this is a stand-alone company that is rewarding shareholders, unlike Yahoo! and AOL.
Gallagher: Yeah. Also I would like to say that they have such a growing market in terms of, so I talked about trading cards, but also with sneakers, which was pretty interesting to me. Their sneakers valued above $100 grew triple-digits, and last quarter their luxury watches are growing pretty fast. I also learned in 2014, Superman comic books sold for, I want you to guess, how much do you think a comic book on eBay sold? I'm saying it, it was obviously a lot of money, but I want you to guess how much it was sold for.
Hill: I'm assuming this was the very first Superman comic book, that's my assumption, $3 million.
Gallagher: Close, $3.2 million.
Hill: Where do you think [Motley Fool analyst] Ron Gross keeps it?
Gallagher: I also thought, I was like, ""Did someone get this for Ron as a gift?"" They also, in 2012, they auctioned off a lunch with Warren Buffett and that sold for charity, and that was sold for $3.5 million.
Hill: Well, and I think the obvious conclusion to draw there, is like, look, Warren Buffett's great. Lunches, what is that? That maxes out at two hours? Whereas you buy the Superman comic, that's forever.
Gallagher: That's forever, and you tell everyone you've ever met. You can show it to them. I guess you could show them a picture of you out having lunch with Warren Buffett, but I don't know that it has the same pizazz.
Hill: Exactly. Fourth quarter results for La-Z-Boy were solidly better than Wall Street was expecting, profits higher, revenue higher. Shares are down almost 10%. I don't understand this. I look at this and I think, yeah, if you just look at the headline of their fourth quarter results, it tracks with everything we've seen recently from businesses like RH Holdings, anything tied to home improvement or home furnishing. Why is this stock getting punished?
Gallagher: Yeah. I think sometimes the sentiment too is the world's opening up again. People are going to spend less time at home. They're going to start spending money on things that they haven't spent money on the past year. People have spent so much money in the past year on home furnishings. But like you said, their quarter 4 results were great. Their sales were up 41%, which beat estimates by about 4%. Their same source sales for the La-Z-Boy furniture gallery is more than double. They were up 114%. Joybird, which is a brand that they own, which I had never heard of, but looked up a little bit. Those sales more than doubled up 144% to about $37 million. So a small part of their overall sales, but still quite interesting. Then for the full-year, their sales were up about 2% to $1.7 billion, which is so much higher than I thought La-Z-Boy sales would have been if you asked me what their sales were. The one thing is that they are anticipating their increase in manufacturing capacity, but they're expecting a lot of headwinds consistently within their supply chain. So raw material price increases are going to be pretty bad for them. They said that they're going to offset that by price increases for their products, but they do warn that they have more demand than they have supply, which isn't something that I would prefer that than the other way around, but you will see that supply chain headwind, which I think you've also seen with a lot of people who have ordered furniture in the past six months, there have been consistently long waiting list. So with low switching costs, I think maybe that's also on people's minds of: ""Well, maybe I won't get at La-Z-Boy. Maybe I'll go somewhere else where I can work with a supply chain in a more satisfactory way toward the customers.""
Hill: For people of a certain age like myself, La-Z-Boy brings to mind one piece of furniture and one only, and that is the recliner. If you were a kid in the '70s, either you had one in your house or you knew someone who, and it was the greatest thing in the world in terms of furniture. The idea that you could sit in a chair, reach down, pull a lever, and then the feet would go up and you could recline in it. You go to the website for La-Z-Boy, and it's almost unrecognizable for people like me. The fact that they have all these different brands, all these different types of furniture. I'm wondering if you think there is enough brand equity in the name that they just keep it going. Because I don't know, it just seems like they're doing a lot more than the name La-Z-Boy would suggest.
Gallagher: Yeah. I don't think that that's a name that engenders the idea of like, ""I'm going to spend a lot,"" in the way if I talk about West Elm, I know that West Elm is high quality and I'm going to pay a higher price for it. Now that you say that, I remember La-Z-Boys with the recliner because I'm pretty sure my grandpa had one. But when I think of La-Z-Boy, I think the sectionals of those really big sofas that people really like lean into. But I don't know that they have the brand name associated with someone saying: ""I need a sofa. Let me make sure I check out La-Z-Boy."" Especially with so many online options, I think more people are probably going to a Wayfair or West Elm or one of those other more well-known brands. But their sales were still very impressive. Maybe more people are thinking of La-Z-Boy than I give credit for.
Hill: I guess I'm surprised that, not that it's still around, but that it's still around as a public company, and the market cap is about $1.8 billion. Considering their international footprint, I don't know, it almost makes me wonder if at some point in the next five years someone acquires them because they can take the best parts of this business, put it into a larger distribution channel, and make it work more profitably.
Gallagher: Yeah. That could be interesting, and they do have a brand name. They do clearly have some brand loyalty. So that could be an interesting addition to maybe a larger furniture brand. I'm trying to get that customer base.

2021-06-25 00:00:00+00:00,Is the Great Graphics Card Shortage Coming to an End?,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/is-the-great-graphics-card-shortage-coming-to-an-end-2021-06-25,,,"Gaming enthusiasts have been finding it difficult to get their hands on the latest graphics processing units (GPUs) from NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) thanks to huge demand from gamers, scalpers, and cryptocurrency miners. Furthermore, supply chain disruptions caused by the pandemic have also thrown production lines out of gear and added to the problem. As a result, gamers have been paying through the nose to get their hands on graphics cards.
However, a ray of hope is emerging for gaming enthusiasts, as graphics card prices have started pulling back lately. But does this mean that the great graphics card shortage is nearing an end? Let's find out.
Image source: Getty Images
Graphics card prices show signs of pulling back
Tom's Hardware's GPU pricing index, which tracks graphics card prices based on eBay data, indicates that the upswing in prices may have come to an end. For instance, the price of the flagship NVIDIA RTX 3090 was down 4.4% in the first half of June compared to the same period in May.
It is worth noting that the RTX 3090's price dropped even though NVIDIA hasn't limited the hash rate of the card, which makes it more desirable for miners as it is capable of mining cryptocurrency at faster speeds. In fact, the RTX 3090 delivers more than double the mining profits when compared to the previous generation RTX 2080 Ti.
Meanwhile, the RTX 3080, 3070, 3060 Ti, and 3060 have limited hash rates (and are less attractive for mining) and saw much bigger price declines. The RTX 3080's price fell 11.5%, the RTX 3070 saw an 8.5% decline, and the 3060 Ti's drop was 12.6% in the first half of June over the prior month.
AMD's offerings also saw price declines even though the chipmaker hasn't restricted the mining capabilities of its cards. Prices of the Radeon RX 6800 XT, the RX 6800, and the RX 6700 XT fell 6%, 8.1%, and 5.6%, respectively, month-over-month.
The downside is that the prices are still quite high when compared to manufacturer-suggested levels. The RTX 3080 has a manufacturer-suggested retail price (MSRP) of $699, but its market price was almost $2,000 according to Tom's Hardware's data. The cheaper RTX 3060 Ti is being sold for nearly $1,240, compared to its MSRP of $399.
So there's still a long way to go before graphics cards become affordable -- but the recent price correction could gain more momentum.
More price correction could be in the cards
Graphics card prices have dropped for two reasons. First, market leader NVIDIA has been trying to ensure an increased supply of graphics cards to miners so that they don't price gamers out of the market. The graphics card specialist has brought out specialized cryptocurrency mining processors (CMPs) to address demand from miners, and these chips have been a hit.
NVIDIA sold CMPs worth $155 million in Q1. It expects to sell $400 million worth of these chips in the current quarter. What's more, rumors suggest that the chipmaker is reportedly working on a more powerful CMP capable of outperforming the RTX 3090, with a hash rate that could be a third higher than the flagship GPU's. Such an offering could boost NVIDIA's top-line growth as the cryptocurrency mining hardware market is expected to add $2.80 billion in revenue over the next four years, according to TechNavio.
The second reason why graphics card prices could be coming down is a slowdown in mining demand, freeing up more supply for gamers. According to third-party reports, demand for graphics cards for cryptocurrency mining in China -- the world's biggest country in terms of mining -- could be slipping because of a government crackdown.
Jon Peddie Research reports that cryptocurrency miners bought 700,000 graphics cards in Q1, accounting for a fourth of the total GPUs sold. So weak mining demand should ideally improve supply and help lower GPU prices. That's what's reportedly happening in China -- the clampdown in mining has reportedly led to a reduction of up to 45% in graphics card prices, according to Tom's Hardware. China's sway on the global mining market could lead to a further GPU price correction, especially considering that lower mining profits could force many miners to offload their cards in the pre-owned market.
What's in it for investors?
NVIDIA stands to win big from an improved supply of graphics cards. The company has a huge installed base of users that are still running older-generation GPUs. Less than 20% of the 140 million users of GeForce graphics cards use the new RTX chips, so an improved supply would boost NVIDIA's shipments. This modest level of RTX adoption in the gaming market bodes well for NVIDIA's gaming business, which pulled in $2.76 billion in revenue last quarter, growing 106% year-over-year and accounting for nearly 49% of total sales.
Meanwhile, NVIDIA's OEM (original equipment manufacturer) business, which includes revenue from the sale of CMPs, also registered massive growth, with revenue jumping 137% year-over-year to $327 million. The end-market opportunity indicates that the OEM business could sustain comparable high growth levels going forward, as the mining market has scope for additional revenue.
All of this indicates that NVIDIA is likely to remain a top growth stock even if GPU prices come down, as gamers will keep making a beeline for its RTX 30 series cards and drive stronger volumes once supply improves.
