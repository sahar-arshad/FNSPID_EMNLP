Nov 23 (Reuters) - Dollar Tree Inc DLTR.O beat quarterly sales estimates on Tuesday, as returning consumer appetite for discretionary items helped counter a tapering in pandemic-driven surge in grocery shopping.
Discount stores have benefited as people turned conservative about their spending during the pandemic and looked for bargain deals, but the retailers might now be forced to raise prices under pressure from supply-chain disruptions and rising costs.
The discount retailer, known for selling wares at the $1 price-point, said it has begun rolling out items at $1.25 at all Dollar Tree stores in the United States.
Net income for the company fell to $216.8 million, or 96 cents per share, in the third quarter ended October 30 from $330.0 million, or $1.39 per share, a year earlier.
Net sales rose 3.9% to $6.42 billion, beating the average analyst estimate of $6.41 billion, according to Refinitiv IBES data.

2021-11-23 00:00:00+00:00,Not A Dollar Anymore!! Dollar Tree Raises Prices To $1.25,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/not-a-dollar-anymore-dollar-tree-raises-prices-to-%241.25,,,"(RTTNews) - Discount retailer Dollar Tree Inc. (DLTR) announced on Tuesday that it would soon start selling most of its products at the price of $1.25, instead of its regular $1.00. The store took this decision, keeping in mind the impact of rising freight costs and other pandemic-related issues.
The company said that the new prices would be functional from the first quarter of 2022 and would allow the retailer to regain its gross margin range of 35-36 percent by next year. The Dollar Tree store is famous for selling everything for $1 but now the company is forced to raise prices as it deals with high costs and other related issues.
Commenting on the price rise, Chief Executive Officer Michael Witynski said, ""The higher price point allows the discounter to expand assortments, introduce new products and sizes as well as bring back traffic-driving products.""
Skyrocketing freight prices from global supply chain disruptions have deeply cut into the profits of most American retailers, who are already struggling with higher labor and raw material costs.
The company said that the freight costs were very high than expected in the third quarter and this would continue for some time.
Looking ahead, the company provided guidance for the fourth quarter and raised its outlook for the full-year 2022.
For the fourth quarter, the company estimates earnings in a range of $1.69 to $1.79 per share on consolidated net sales between $7.02 billion and $7.18 billion, based on a low single-digit increase in same-store sales for the combined enterprise.
On average, 15 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect the company to report earnings of $1.75 per share on sales of $7.03 billion for the quarter. Analysts' estimates typically exclude special items.
Looking ahead to fiscal 2022, the company now projects earnings in a range of $5.48 to $5.58 per share on consolidated net sales between $26.25 billion and $26.41 billion, based on a low single-digit increase in same-store sales and 3.3% square footage growth.

Michael A. Witynski -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Thank you, Randy. Good morning. Thank you for joining us on today's call. I would first like to take a moment to recognize our store associates, distribution center staff, our field leadership and our world-class merchants. Our teams are working around the clock to do everything they can to defend against the current inflationary environment, keep our shelves stocked and provide customers with undeniable value and great service in easy-to-shop, close-to-home store locations. Their hard work and dedication is critical to our Company's success and I'd like to extend sincere thanks for their unwavering commitment to our customers.
We experienced a strong finish to the third quarter as shoppers are increasingly focused on value in this inflationary environment. We continue to see accelerated progress in our key strategic initiatives, including Dollar Tree Plus, Combo Stores and our H2 format.
During the past quarter freight costs were significantly higher than expected. Our fourth quarter outlook, which Kevin will provide later in the call, reflects the higher cost structure we experienced in the third quarter. However, our EPS for the third quarter was at the higher end of the range as the performance of the rest of the business offset these higher freight costs.
Freight and supply chain disruptions, of course, continue to be our biggest challenge in the near term by far and the impact will continue for a while. But this challenge is transitory. As we detailed last quarter, our team continues to take robust action to mitigate the impact of freight costs and supply chain disruptions. We believe that based on the steps that we have taken, we will benefit meaningfully as these challenges abate.
The Dollar Tree segment delivered a comp sales increase of 60 basis points against its toughest quarterly compare in nearly three years. On a two-year comp stack basis, this was a sequential improvement of 170 basis points from the prior quarter. Discretionary continues to perform well with a 3.2% comp for the quarter. Consumables were impacted by assortment constraints and past dues. Our $3 and $5 Plus assortment continues to resonate well with our shoppers as we had tremendous sell-through on our Halloween merchandise and fall decor. And for the year our multi-price point merchandise will exceed our sales plan and we will end this fiscal year with Dollar Tree Plus in nearly 600 stores, exceeding our previous target of 500 stores by the end of the year.
Family Dollar delivered a positive 2.7% comp against the 6.4% increase a year ago. This represented the third consecutive quarter that Family Dollar two-year comp stack has exceeded 9%. The consumable side of the business comped over 3% while discretionary was slightly negative as we cycled stimulus dollars from the prior year. We are extremely pleased with the Family Dollar brand as the business continues to gain share.
Comps of both banners were driven by an increase in average ticket, partially offset by a decline in transaction count. The last month of the quarter, October, represented the strongest comp for both banners.
Our digital offerings continued to evolve, while we are steadfastly focused on best meeting our customers' changing needs. In October, we announced our expanded partnership with Instacart to now include same-day delivery from nearly 7,000 Dollar Tree stores. Nearly 100 million US households now have delivery options from 13,000 of our store locations. We are very pleased with the initial results from the latest expansion.
Turning to the $1.25 price point. Our leadership team has been planning for the expansion of this initiative since late summer. As you know, in September we announced our plans to add price points above $1 to all Dollar Tree Plus stores and on a test and learn basis to selected legacy Dollar Tree stores. As a result of the positive customer feedback and store performance during the initial phase, we have introduced the initiative to nearly 200 additional legacy Dollar Tree stores.
In today's press release, we announced for the first time in Dollar Tree's 35-year history we are lifting the $1 price point cap at all Dollar Tree stores on the majority of our assortment. The $1.25 price point enhances our ability to materially expand assortments, introduce new products and sizes and provide families with more of their daily essentials. We will have greater flexibility to continue providing incredible value and help customers get the everyday items they need and celebratory and seasonal products that Dollar Tree is best known for.
Additionally, we are now reintroducing many customer favorites and key traffic driving domestic and consumable products that Dollar Tree had previously discontinued due to the constraints of the $1 price point. The new price point will also enable us to mitigate the historically high merchandising cost increases, including freight and distribution costs as well as higher operating costs such as wage increases. Our teams are focused on speed, execution and customer research and our shoppers are responding favorably. When surveyed the majority of our customers indicated they were already aware of the previously announced new price point and not surprisingly, many have also indicated they are seeing price increases across the market and that Dollar Tree is still providing the products they need at undeniable value.
We are extremely focused on flawless execution and are providing our leadership team out in the field with tools to support a seamless transition. Actions include providing teams with a conversion checklist to ensure consistently achieve [Phonetic] across markets and stores, dedicate adequate store hours to complete the preparation tasks, including removing the signage and display elements referring to the EveryThing's At Dollar, implementing the new signage regarding the $1.25 price point on displays, end caps and shelf strips throughout the store, hosting clear communications to customers in entry ways and at the checkout and we are equipping our store teams with messaging for responding to customer inquiries.
We have closely monitored the performance of the test stores and sharper reaction through extensive customer intercepts and third-party surveys since our initial test began. We will continue to gather feedback throughout the process to ensure we remain fiercely committed to our brand promise of providing customers with extreme value every day along with more thrills, more fun and more new items every week.
For 35 years, we've been able to manage through inflationary periods to maintain the Everything for $1 philosophy that distinguished Dollar Tree and made it one of the most successful retail concepts for three decades. However, we strongly believe this is the appropriate time to shift away from the constraints of the $1 price point in order to continue offering extreme value to our customers.
The independent surveys of shoppers across US have indicated that 77% of the shoppers were almost immediately aware of the price point change. And of those 77%, 31% already knew before they visited the store and 17% became immediately aware upon entering store, while 29% were aware within minutes of entering the store. Critically, 91% of those surveyed indicated they would shop with the same or increased frequency. We will continue to monitor the success of these initiatives and we believe we will see improvement in the survey results since now we have the ability to further expand the product offering and reintroduce key traffic-driving items.
Upon validating the store execution, customer reception and the performance results were as anticipated, we expanded the program to nearly 200 additional stores across three major markets and we are pleased to say the results have been relatively consistent. As expected, we are seeing lifts in comp sales, partially offset by smaller decline in unit sales. We are seeing an initial lift to product margins that will normalize over time as our merchant teams evolve our assortments. Importantly, we expect this initiative will enable us to mitigate the higher freight other inflationary costs in order to return to our historical gross margin of 35% to 36% in fiscal 2022 while improving the merchandising we are providing for our customers.
All the steps I mentioned have set a solid foundation to streamline the execution of this important milestone in our Company's history. We have been working hard to prepare this for -- this key strategic initiative to ensure that we are providing customers with great products while unlocking long-term shareholder value. We are focused on aggressively executing our plan to roll out the new price point across the entire footprint of legacy Dollar Tree stores. Our teams will be introducing the new price point in more than 2,000 additional legacy Dollar Tree stores in December and complete the rollout to all stores by the end of the first quarter in fiscal 2022.
Concurrently our company's merchants are working to continually enhance the offerings to drive traffic, capture market share and further grow customer loyalty. We are working with our suppliers and we have already begun introducing new items every week, including seasonal crafts, party supplies, food essentials and more. Beyond the changes at our legacy Dollar Tree stores, we are also continuing to expand the availability of $3 and $5 Plus assortment.
As I noted a few moments ago, we will exceed our previous goal of now adding the Plus concept to nearly 600 stores by the end of the year. We plan to add the Plus assortment to another 1,500 stores in fiscal 2022 and complete at least 5,000 stores in total by the end of fiscal 2024.
We are enthusiastic about the opportunity and improved performance of Dollar Tree by continuing to deliver extreme value to our customers at the new 1.25 price point, driving comp sales and improving store productivity, enhancing flexibility to better manage the overall business in an inflationary environment. And as previously mentioned, we are turning Dollar Tree gross margins back to the chain's historical 35% to 36% annual range in fiscal 2022.
I will now hand the call over to Kevin to provide details on Q3 performance and our outlook.
Kevin S. Wampler -- Chief Financial Officer
Thanks, Mike, and good morning. Our third quarter EPS of $0.96 per share was near the high end of our $0.88 to $0.98 guidance range. Consolidated net sales increased 3.9% to $6.42 billion, comprised of $3.42 billion at Dollar Tree and $3 billion at Family Dollar. Enterprise same-store sales increased 1.6% as we cycled a 5.1% increase from a year ago, representing a 6.7% increase on a two-year stacked basis.
Comps for the Dollar Tree segment increased 0.6%. Family Dollar same store sales increased 2.7% cycling a strong 6.4% increase from last year. On a two-year stacked basis, Dollar Tree comps increased 4.6%, which was 170 basis point improvement from Q2 and Family Dollar increased 9.1%.
Dollar Tree's comp was comprised of a 1.8% increase in average ticket, partially offset by 1.1% decline in traffic. Family Dollar experienced a 5.8% increase in average ticket, partially offset by a 3% decline in traffic.
Gross profit was $1.76 billion for the quarter. Gross margin was 27.5% compared to 31.2% in the prior year's quarter. Gross profit margin for Dollar Tree segment declined 470 basis points to 30.2% when compared to the prior year's quarter. Factors impacting the segment's gross margin performance included merchandise cost, including freight, increased 475 basis points driven by higher freight costs and lower initial markdown, partially offset by favorable mix from increased sales of higher-margin discretionary merchandise.
Occupancy costs increased 10 basis points as a result of loss of leverage due to a lower comparable store net sales increase and higher real estate tax expense. Distribution costs increased 10 basis points from higher depreciation costs related to two new distribution centers and higher hourly wages, partially offset by lower COVID-19 related expenses. Shrink improved 25 basis points related to favorable inventory results and a decrease in the shrink accrual rate.
Gross profit margin for the Family Dollar segment declined 240 basis points to 24.4% in the third quarter. The year-over-year delta included the following. Merchandise costs including freight increased 220 basis points related to higher freight costs. Distribution costs increased 20 basis points compared to the prior-year quarter due to higher wages partially offset by lower COVID-19 related expenses. Markdown costs increased 20 basis points, primarily due to higher clearance markdowns. Occupancy costs increased 5 basis points, primarily due to higher real estate taxes and shrink improved 30 basis points related to favorable inventory results and a decrease in the shrink accrual rate.
Consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses improved 100 basis points to 22.7% of total revenue compared to 23.7% in Q3 last year. We cycled $35.3 million in COVID-19 related costs of 57 basis points in the prior-year's quarter. For the third quarter, the SG&A rate for the Dollar Tree segment as a percentage of total revenue improved 50 basis points to 21.7% when compared to the prior year's quarter.
Payroll cost improved 30 basis points, primarily due to lower COVID-19 related store payroll costs and lower incentive compensation expenses, partially offset by minimum wage increases and higher health insurance costs. And other SG&A decreased by 25 basis points resulting from the benefit associated with the settlement of a contractual dispute and the realization of certain tax credits.
For Family Dollar the third quarter SG&A rate, as a percentage of total revenue, improved 80 basis points to 21.4% compared to 22.2% in the prior year's quarter. Payroll costs decreased 65 basis points, primarily due to lower COVID-19 related store payroll costs and lower incentive compensation expenses, partially offset by minimum wage increases. Store facility costs decreased 30 basis points, primarily due to lower repair and maintenance expenses and lower telecommunication expenses.
Depreciation and amortization expense increased 5 basis points due to expenditures associated with the store optimization program and other SG&A expense increased 20 basis points, primarily due to increases in advertising and travel expenses and an increase in insurance costs related to general liability claims. Corporate support and other expenses as a percentage of total revenue decreased approximately 30 basis points compared to the prior year's quarter, primarily due to lower incentive compensation.
Operating income was $310.5 million or 4.8% of total revenue in the third quarter. Our non-operating expenses totaled $33.6 million comprised primarily of net interest expense. Our effective tax rate was 21.7% compared to 22.8% in the prior-year quarter.
Company had net income of $216.8 million or $0.96 per diluted share as compared to net earnings of $330 million or $1.39 per diluted share in the prior-year's quarter. Both cash and cash equivalents at quarter-end totaled $701.4 million compared to $1.42 billion at the end of fiscal 2020. Outstanding debt as of October 30 was $3.25 billion. The Company did not repurchase shares during the quarter as it was preparing for the announcement and launch of its $1.25 price point initiative across the Dollar Tree stores. We currently have $2.5 billion remaining on our share repurchase authorization.
Inventory for Dollar Tree at quarter-end increased 15.2% from the same time last year, consisting primarily of a significant increase in goods on the water year-over-year. Comp store inventories are down 6.4% compared to a year ago when they were down 7.4%. Inventory for Family Dollar at quarter-end increased 12.4% from the same period last year. Comp store inventories are up 7.2% after being down 13.2% in 2020.
Capital expenditures were $295.6 million in the third quarter versus $238.7 million in Q3 last year. For fiscal 2021, we expect the consolidated capex will be approximately $1.1 billion.
Depreciation and amortization totaled $178.5 million for Q3 compared to $170.1 million in the third quarter last year. For fiscal 2021 we now expect consolidated depreciation and amortization to be approximately $715 million.
Our outlook for the remainder of 2021 includes the following assumptions. We have forecasted continued pressure on wages due to the current shortage of workers available for our stores and distribution centers. We expect shrink will continue to be a tailwind but not at the same rate as we are cycling improved results from the prior year. Higher sales, lower store inventory levels, technology, and better processes continue to drive better results.
Net interest expense is expected to be approximately $33.6 million in Q4 and approximately $133 million for fiscal 2021. We estimate consolidated net sales for the fourth quarter will range from $7.02 billion to $7.18 billion based on a low single-digit increase in same-store sales for the combined enterprise. Diluted earnings per share are estimated to be in the range of $1.69 to $1.79.
As Mike mentioned earlier, freight costs were significantly higher than expected in the third quarter. Our fourth quarter outlook reflects the expectation of higher transportation costs. These costs will be offset by the benefit of the Dollar Tree stores that are transitioned to the $1.25 price point, net of one-time costs to implement that change. Consolidated net sales for full fiscal year 2021 are expected to range from $26.25 billion to $26.41 billion based on a low single-digit increase in same-store sales and 3.3% square footage growth. The Company now estimates diluted earnings per share will range from $5.48 to $5.58.
The freight costs for fiscal 2021 are now expected to be approximately $2 higher than fiscal 2020 expressed in terms of the impact on diluted earnings per share. While much of the focus has been on transpacific ocean container rates, we are being impacted by all aspects of freight, including higher costs for inland transportation by truck and rail and higher diesel costs. Additionally, in the third quarter we moved more containers than originally planned, which required utilizing the spot market rates higher than forecasted.
To echo Mike's comments, freight continues to be our biggest challenge in the near term. We believe the majority of the freight challenges are transitory. The rest of the business is performing much better in the near term. Our outlook assumes a tax rate of 22.1% for the fourth quarter and 22.7% for fiscal 2021. Weighted average diluted share counts are assumed to be 225.9 million shares for Q4 and 228.9 million shares for the full year. Our outlook does not include any share repurchases. We have $2.5 billion remaining on our existing share repurchase authorization.
And I'll now turn the call back over to Mike.
Michael A. Witynski -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Kevin. As I mentioned earlier on the call, we ended the third quarter with momentum in the business and that has certainly continued in both segments. Through the end of last week quarter-to-date, our comps were running at a 4.9% increase at Family Dollar and a 3% increase at Dollar Tree and we are seeing positive trends as customers are planning to gather in person with family and friends to celebrate the holidays this year.
The combination of shoppers seeking value in the inflationary environment along with the acceleration of the Company's initiatives, including Combo Stores and Dollar Tree Plus bode well for the continued traction and store productivity. In 2022 we plan implementing the $3 and $5 Plus assortment into 1,500 more Dollar Tree stores. We will also be adding 400 Combo Stores through new or renovated stores and we plan to renovate 800 legacy Family Dollar stores into the H2 format.
Additionally, lifting the $1 constraint represents a monumental step for our organization and we are enthusiastic about the opportunity to meaningfully improve our shoppers' experience and unlock value for our stakeholders. We will be relentless in our commitment to offer our customers the best value possible, albeit at a different price point while guided by Dollar Tree's same founding principles. We are extremely excited and confident about the opportunities in 2022 and beyond. We are very focused on the acceleration of the initiatives that are working for us and are operating with clarity, focus and speed. As I previously mentioned, we do expect Dollar Tree banner to return to its historical annual range of 35% to 36% gross margin in fiscal 2022.
Before we go into Q&A, I would like to make a brief statement. We appreciate that many of you are focused on the Form 13D filed by Mantle Ridge two Fridays ago. So we will make a short statement about that but will not entertain any questions on the topic.
We believe Mantle Ridge has made a very smart investment. As we said, Dollar Tree's Board of Directors and management team are always open to listen to input and engaging with our shareholders and we evaluate any ideas for constructive value creation with the best interest of all shareholders and stakeholders in mind. In keeping with our practice not to comment publicly on our private discussions with individual investors, we will not take any questions regarding Mantle Ridge. We appreciate your understanding and cooperation.
Operator, we are now ready to take questions.
Questions and Answers:
Operator
Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Your first question will come from Matthew Boss with J.P. Morgan.
Matthew Boss -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst
Thanks. So maybe first the Dollar Tree banner, two-year stacked comps back to mid-single digits in the third quarter November holding the momentum despite supply side constraints still remaining. I guess, could you just help speak to drivers of the stabilization, what's your confidence also in that 35% to 36% gross margin for next year, meaning do we need a material reset in freight or is the driver of this the pricing change across the fleet that you outlined today?
Michael A. Witynski -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Good morning, Matt. Thanks for the question. I would say the main driver of that is, as Kevin said, inside that forecast for next year we are anticipating freight to pretty much look like it did this year. So the major change would be the $1.25 price point as the key enabler to mitigate that. And it's also going to give us the opportunity to bring in new items and a new assortment that will drive traffic in Dollar Tree and that will help offset where we've lost traffic this year historically.
Matthew Boss -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst
And then, Mike, as a follow-up on Family Dollar, what do you believe the concept takes from this pandemic, meaning, are you seeing new customers, what initiatives do you have to retain some of the new footsteps that you're seeing? And on the -- as we think about kind of where we go from here, what do you think the sustainable comp for the Family Dollar concept multi-year is from here as we exit the pandemic?
Michael A. Witynski -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Thanks, Matt. So on the Family Dollar side, we believe that based on the fundamental changes our merchants have made in our price points and in our assortment on the discretionary side, along with the continued growth we see on the consumable side, we believe that we will sustain our growth beyond the pandemic as we exit it and it's evident in our three quarters in a row of over 9% two-year stack of comp sales.
And we're seeing our customers really gravitate to our assortment. You heard us say our consumable side is comping well and they're buying more of the discretionary side as we get it in our stores. And we believe that long term we can sustain that low single-digit growth and it's really evident in our Combo Stores and our H2 formats. So we're going to exceed our 1,250 H2 renovations and we continue to see a 10% increase when we renovate those stores.
But more importantly is that Combo Stores that bringing these two great companies together allow us to drive a great format in rural America and there's 3,000 towns that we've identified. And we're going to grow that store count by more than 400. And as we shared on the last quarter and I think we have it posted on our website, our Combo Stores deliver 17% more than our pro forma, than our new store expected, they grow 23% more when we renovate them and when we relocate them, it's a 40% increase. So those things are really driving not only the top line, but our margin is stronger and is translating into a more productive store. So I think our initiatives, I think the foundational things that we've fixed at Family Dollar and then with our key initiatives going forward will enable us to continue to grow single store comp.
Matthew Boss -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst
That's great color. Best of luck.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from John Heinbockel with Guggenheim.
John Heinbockel -- Guggenheim Securities -- Analyst
So, Mike, let me start with you think the $1.25 price point will -- you said majority, but what do you think that will apply to in terms of the assortment, number one? And then number two, tied to that, I know you're getting a lift on price. Is there any way to what you've seen on impact to volume on those items specifically and then also the store as a whole, other than they're down you must have a sense of how much they're down?
Michael A. Witynski -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Thanks. So on the -- the majority of the stores will be at the $1.25 price point. Just like us today where Dollar Tree has Every Things for $1, but there are categories in food, in candy bars up at the front register, in our greeting cards, and in some poster board where they are lower than $1.
So if you can imagine everything is just bringing in reset in that same footprint at the $1.25 and then those categories and items will remain at the -- remain at the $1 price point. So it's the majority of the footprint inside of our store.
And we will share -- as we continue to roll this out, we will share more details about the comp lift in the margin. But we see enough evidence that the comp between the comp lift and the margin expansion will help mitigate this burden of freight that we're experiencing this year and get us back to their historic 35% to 36% gross profit range.
John Heinbockel -- Guggenheim Securities -- Analyst
And then maybe just as a follow-up to that. How do you guys think about marketing the $1.25, right, you want people to experience it naturally, right, rather than you want to call attention to it unduly. So it that -- it's basically just I'll see it when I come into the store. Otherwise, you're not going to really do a lot of TV, radio, print around the strategy or how do you attack that?
Michael A. Witynski -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Historically Dollar Tree did not do a lot of external marketing. Everything was in the store, in the excitement, in the value of the product and it's really driven because our assortment is always moving and ever-flowing. So we want to talk more about the great value that we can bring at that $1.25 price point and they'll see that assortment that they see when they are in our store. And our customers gave us -- they gave us credit for that.
When we did our customer research and customer intercepts, they were telling us that even at the $1.25 there is still great value and they're going to continue shopping here. And then we can tell in some of the unit decline in some of the categories where our intuition we knew that we needed to improve some of our assortment and value in certain categories. So our merchants are working extremely hard at identifying those and getting those products flowing. And I would say, new products and new product mix will be flowing through certainly in the first half of the year as they change their mix and get everything aligned to the new $1.25 price point.
John Heinbockel -- Guggenheim Securities -- Analyst
Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Lasser with UBS.
Michael Lasser -- UBS -- Analyst
Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. So you tested Dollar Tree Plus for a couple of years. You did a planning process for the move to $1.25 price point, I think at the end of the summer. The move to the full rollout is faster than the move to Dollar Tree Plus. Obviously, you're seeing a lot of inflation.
So this is probably pushing the issue. How do you manage the risk that consumers are going to push back? They've become accustomed to expected $1 price point. And so you're going to have to manage around the cannibalization. At the same time you do have a lot of going on into next year. How do you ensure that you're going to get consistency in your execution as you're implementing more initiatives than you have had in quite some time?
Michael A. Witynski -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Well, the $1.25 is -- our team has been very focused to bring clarity to it. We've got a very detailed plan for our operation teams. And the key to it is going in and cleansing the store. So we've got a team that is doing that. Then we come in and we clearly sign -- and we're putting signage throughout the entire store so that customer understands the $1.25. And then at the same time, our merchants are working hard today and they have been working actually. On their last buy trip it was with the intent of the $1.25 price point. So our assortment is better than ever and we're so excited on the hard work that our merchant team is doing. In fact, they've already looked at and reviewed over 7,000 of our core items. It's almost 7,500 of our core items. They've put them on a table. They've done a comp shops. So they bring in product from other competitors to make sure that at $1.25 this product still has an unbelievable value for our customers and it resonates well with them. And then the ones that don't, we're working hard on and we're attacking and we're bringing in those new items.
And then beside that we're bringing in additional items that we had to discontinue in the past. So now those items would be coming in that customers responded to very favorably in the past and we believe that will drive traffic. And most of those items are in your consumables side of the business where we've seen softness over this year, where we've been limited to the $1 price point. We've lost some items. And we'll be able to bring meaningful value at the $1.25 in our frozen section and in our food section. So we're really excited about our plan.
And then in our Dollar Tree Plus, the way we think about it, that's sitting at about over 600 of our stores and it's about 10% to 12% of the space in our stores, 200 linear feet and the team is very good. They've been delivering that all year. So next year we are just going to deliver an expansion of that. So just grow same exact product assortment, different seasonal items, of course, but the same categories, the same square footage that we've done to 600 stores this year. So it's something we've already done. We already know what it takes to get it done and our stores are executing it very well and our customers understand it in a store. It will be $1.25 now, of $3 and $5 that's clearly marked and they're responding very, very well to the $3 and $5 items.
And then if you think about -- that's in 2022 and then in 2023 for our Dollar Tree Plus, the growth will be twofold. We will grow more store count, but then also our merchants next year while we're rolling out the same footprint to 1,500 stores next year, behind the scenes at the same time, the merchants are going to be working really hard at more categories, more assortment, can you go from a 10% of your store to 20% of your store, what kind of items can we really bring in at that $3 and $5 that will really drive more business to the stores.
So our lift to 6% as we've -- and it's still hovering around that 6%, we think it can be more as we grow this going forward. So the $1.25 we've got a great answer on, we're going to go with clarity and focus and speed from a marketing and in-store execution and then our merchants are working hard at analyzing every item to make sure it has got that great value. And then we're going to grow the Dollar Tree Plus as we did the 600 stores with focus.
Michael Lasser -- UBS -- Analyst
Understood. My follow-up question is on your expectation to get to 35% to 36% gross margin in your Dollar Tree business -- banner next year. It seems like that will drive a mid-teen increase at least in your gross profit dollars. So based on that, what type of EBIT improvement would you be looking for because you are probably going to see significant fixed cost leverage? And if you're going to roll out $1.25 price point and the freight pressure potentially rolls over, would you actually let your gross profit margin for the Dollar Tree banner rise above 36% if all of this comes together at the same time or would you look to reinvest the upside back into the business? Thanks.
Kevin S. Wampler -- Chief Financial Officer
Yeah, Michael. I think the way we think about it, obviously, is we are investing back into that product. We're always going to live by the rule that was the mainstay of Dollar Tree which is the product has to be an unbelievable value in the marketplace and that's what the Company was built upon and that's what it will continue to be built upon. It's just that price point has changed.
So to your question about the margin, obviously, it's a little early at this point to talk about next year and, obviously, we'll have a lot more information to share when we talk again on March 3 for end of the year and we'll be able to give a better direction. A lot of moving pieces right now. We want to make sure we capture them all and give everybody the true picture of all those moving pieces. But we do obviously see a clear path to the 35% to 36% gross margin for Dollar Tree next year. So I think that's the most important thing that we can give you today, obviously with more details to come as to all those moving pieces.
Michael A. Witynski -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. I'd just reiterate, unlocking and moving to the $1.25 gives us the flexibility that we need to be able to manage and mitigate the high cost of, as you saw 400 basis points in margin at Dollar Tree, and at the same time really bring more value, greater items, and a better assortment that will drive traffic and top line sales for our customers that they're so used to at Dollar Tree. So as Kevin stated, we're going to be more focused on getting the assortment, right and driving traffic and long-term growth and we can do that and confidently think we can get to the 35% to 36% range.
Michael Lasser -- UBS -- Analyst
Thank you very much.
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Edward Kelly with Wells Fargo.
Edward Kelly -- Wells Fargo -- Analyst
Hi. Good morning, guys. I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about the testing process on the $1.25 price point so far. The initial release that you put out had $1.25 and $1.50 in the release. I was curious as to what that was about. When you did the test, were all of the test just taking most of the assortment to $1.25 or there is some variation there? And then could you help us understand what the impact of elasticity is on the volumes are looking like?
Michael A. Witynski -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Thanks. So we closely monitored it. The majority of the stores were at the $1.25 and that's what our focus is because that's really the price that we need to really bring great value and a meaningful differentiation in our assortment in the consumables side of the business that will drive traffic. So we were very focused on that. And we've been watching the sensitivity and the sales and the units and the response from the customer every week at every store and every market. And as we shared that's been consistent across stores and markets. And where we see the unit decline, it's where we expected it to be and that's where the merchants are working really, really hard on bringing in that new assortment and that new assortment will be layering in, as I said, over time. So it's going to be over the next six months to bring in the assortment on those side to drive the traffic.
And then while we are working the results of the stores and monitoring units and margin and comp at the same time, we were doing in-depth consumer research and listening to our customers and doing customer intercepts and one-on-one surveys with the customers and hearing their response. And they have a lot of trust in Dollar Tree and they believe that as $1.25 it's still going to be an undeniable value because of what they're seeing out in the marketplace and they know the Dollar Tree hasn't raised its price in 35 years. So they have given us credit and now that our buyers are going to take that trust and make sure they deliver undeniable and a great assortment at that new price point. And we'll monitor that as we do our -- as we did at $1 and help drive the business, bring new items in, discontinue items and manage the business accordingly.
Edward Kelly -- Wells Fargo -- Analyst
And just a quick follow-up on that. How powerful is it to be able to bring items back you've discontinued over time or to be able to introduce new items? And then just getting back to the $1.50 because it was in your prior release, is that a price point that might make sense as you start introducing new items next year?
Michael A. Witynski -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Well, right now we can bring in very meaningful items that we discontinued at $1.25 and they are on the food and consumable side where you get a repeat customer and more frequency. So it's important to us. And when we announced we just wanted to have -- we had flexibility out there that we gave examples of $1.25 and $1.50 and our $3 and $5, we didn't say specifically that we would use those. So right now we feel confident in $1.25, the $3 and $5 and as we've said that on our Dollar Tree Plus we're accelerating to 1,500. But by 2024 we will have 5,000 stores that will be at $1.25, $3 and $5 that we will be able to deliver a meaningful assortment and it gives us the flexibility that we need to manage and mitigate these costs and deliver great products and drive our business.
Edward Kelly -- Wells Fargo -- Analyst
Great. Thank you for taking my question.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs.
Kate McShane -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst
Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking our question. Just a question with regards to any kind of activity you saw from more inflationary headwinds and customers trading down and how you anticipate that to look in the fourth quarter relative to what you saw in the third quarter?
Michael A. Witynski -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Well, definitely the customers are feeling the inflation. It's twofold right now. I mean, our customers are benefiting from child tax credit stimulus. In October they had a huge increase of SNAP benefits and they're experiencing increase in hourly wages that you're seeing across the industry. So I think our customers are in a pretty good position, but they are also feeling a lot of pressure on other costs of gas and fuel prices and energy for their homes. So I think right now more than ever, they are going to be relying on great value and that's why I think Dollar Tree and Family Dollar are in a great position to be able to offer that to them in 15,000 locations that are conveniently located.
As far as trading down, we're still not seeing a lot of trade down. There is not a lot of promotion out there in national brands. Private brands are as not as steady as they were throughout the first half of the year. So we haven't seen a big shift right now from the customer.
Kate McShane -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst
Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Brad Thomas with KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Brad Thomas -- Key Banc -- Analyst
Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I was hoping to ask about labor a little bit more and hoping, Mike, you could talk a little bit about how you're dealing with getting good people now and any seasonal staff you've brought on board. And then just to continue to talk about the Dollar Tree side of the business, how you all are planning for some of that incremental complexity as you roll out the $1.25 price point from a labor perspective? Thanks.
Michael A. Witynski -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Brad. So yeah, there are still pressures and it's market-driven both in our distribution centers. We've had to increase our hourly wages in our DCs and have done so and that's embedded in our fourth-quarter outlook and we've made movements there. And I say we're seeing the same thing in our stores, in markets we followed where we had to, to increase our labor rates to attract associates in our stores. And as you've seen across retail, people are still sitting on the sidelines and not working.
So we are working hard at driving benefits and we're raising our hourly wage where we need to and being a convenient place to work through other things of having their schedule on their phones, having a program called daily pay where they can get their pay. They don't have to wait for their paycheck and our associates are liking that a lot and there is a high use of that. So we're doing a lot of things to attract the hourly worker out there in our stores to operate our stores effectively.
But yet, it still is a tough environment out there. And we have seen a little bit of a slip in our store manager turnover where last year during the pandemic, we hit our lowest turnover ever in store manager and now there's -- I think there is a little bit of fatigue and it's creeped up a little bit on us. But our teams are working hard at filling those roles and attracting the talent we need.
Regarding managing the $1.25, there is -- as Kevin said in our fourth quarter, there will be one-time costs of cleansing the store and then remarketing and resigning the store. But once that is set aside, it's really running the same play. They unload the truck, they put it on the shelf. It's clearly marked already, so there really isn't any additional labor hours needed.
And then on our Dollar Tree Plus as we've rolled that out to 600 stores, we have not had to add any additional labor in those stores because the majority of those products are coming in pre-priced. The sections in the store are clearly marked $3 and $5 items and now there'll be a $1.25, $3 and $5. So there really isn't any additional labor needed in those stores, either.
Brad Thomas -- Key Banc -- Analyst
Great. Thanks so much, Mike.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley.
Michael Kessler -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst
Hey, guys. This is Michael Kessler on for Simeon. Thanks for taking our questions.
Michael A. Witynski -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Hi, Michael.
Michael Kessler -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst
I wanted to ask, not -- hey, guys, not to beat a broken drum here with the price point, if I could squeeze in one more, curious why not be more diverse with the price point. It sounds like you're really sticking to the $1.25. You could perhaps be even more precise with price point and manage different SKUs in categories.
I'm curious to know what went into that decision process and am I interpreting, I guess, the strategy with the price point correctly in that regard.
And then, bigger picture on that. Is there even longer-term vision of perhaps price points going up across the store and then you had a separate initiative with Plus at even higher price points and perhaps even melding these initiatives together, expanding Plus to even more of the store [Indecipherable] longer term vision would be, interested here about as well.
Michael A. Witynski -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Thanks for the question. So first of all moving off to $1 price point gives us the flexibility to manage our business and really drive the assortment that our customers are used to and bring value and simplicity to them. So the reason we moved to the $1.25 is that it allows us to do all three of those things.
Our merchants are, I believe, the best in the industry and they've been able to defend and get great product at $1. And we know the type of product we can get at that $1.25 and we'll be able to bring in exciting great product that will drive the business and drive traffic into our stores and enable us to get back to that 35% to 36% margin. And it gives us the flexibility to manage our business going forward and it really brings simplicity. Simplicity is still very important to us.
As it's a single price point our customers understand it and our shoppers, our customers, and our associates understand it. So we'll manage this going forward. I think at first, we're going to go to $1.25 and then we'll be carrying that $1.25 into our Combo Stores as well. So our Combo Stores baseline would be at $1.25 going forward. And it will be wrapped around that Dollar Tree brand and then have great products at the Family Dollar on that side of the business as well. So moving off the Dollar gives us the flexibility to make changes we need to going into the future.
Michael Kessler -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst
Okay. Great. And a quick follow-up on traffic. I think you guys said it was down at both banners. I guess is that -- has it surprised you at all that we haven't seen more of a rebound in traffic relative to last year? Is it of any concern or it's not because tripling [Phonetic] of ticket is up basically more than offsetting the traffic declines? And going forward, especially with higher price points at core Dollar Tree, would it be a fair expectation that traffic could remain down to being more than offset by ticket? How you're thinking about that?
Michael A. Witynski -- President and Chief Executive Officer
We think traffic is going to come back at Dollar Tree. Keep in mind, as Kevin said, with our -- we still have past dues that are 4.5 times greater than what we normally have at Dollar Tree. So there is inventory that we wish we had that would drive that excitement in sales and traffic inside our Dollar Tree. And then we have had some items we've had to discontinue that would be traffic-driving where we were limited at the Dollar price points.
So we think looking forward going to the $1.25, bringing in new assortment and then once we move beyond this transitory freight logistics issues that we have, getting that assortment that we want inside our store, the combination of those two things will get back to driving traffic at our Dollar Tree format.
Michael Kessler -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst
Thanks, Mike.
Operator
Thank you. We do have time for one last question. Our final question comes from Paul Lejuez with Citi.
Paul Lejuez -- Citi Investment Research -- Analyst
Hey, guys. Thanks. Curious if you bring back some of these discontinued items, do you expect the total SKU count to grow or will those be replacing existing SKUs? And then separately, could you just talk about your average ticket at Dollar Tree and how consistent that has been over time? As you move to this $1.25 price point, what are your expectations for that average ticket? Thanks.
Michael A. Witynski -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. On the assortment, that's the beautiful thing about Dollar Tree is we do not have planograms. Our merchants go out and get the very best product at the $1.25 price point. We surprise and delight our customers. We bring different products in depending on the seasons and the front-end of our store changes like the leaves on the trees.
So we will continue to use that flexibility and drive the assortment we need that will be meaningful to our customers and in the key categories that drive traffic and then where they can celebrate their lives and live their lives and decorate their homes. So those are the -- that's how we manage the business before and that's how we'll manage it going forward.
And I'll let Kevin talk about the average ticket, but since the pandemic our average ticket at Dollar Tree has been elevated and it's been consistently elevated throughout and we think that this $1.25 will help with that.
Kevin S. Wampler -- Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. I think just as a point of reference pre-pandemic the Dollar Tree price point has hovered right around that $8.50 range and since the pandemic, it's been closer to the $10 mark. I think as we go forward with the $1.25 price point, I think it will remain elevated. So the question has always been as traffic return, would we see the average ticket come down. And to this point, we haven't really seen that aspect. But -- so overall, I think in general that the price -- the average ticket will remain elevated as we go forward.
Paul Lejuez -- Citi Investment Research -- Analyst

(DLTR) provided guidance for the fourth quarter and raised its outlook for the full-year 2022.
For the fourth quarter, the company estimates earnings in a range of $1.69 to $1.79 per share on consolidated net sales between $7.02 billion and $7.18 billion, based on a low single-digit increase in same-store sales for the combined enterprise. On average, 15 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect the company to report earnings of $1.75 per share on sales of $7.03 billion for the quarter. Analysts' estimates typically exclude special items.
Looking ahead to fiscal 2021, the company now projects earnings in a range of $5.48 to $5.58 per share on consolidated net sales between $26.25 billion and $26.41 billion, based on a low single-digit increase in same-store sales and 3.3% square footage growth.
Previously, the company expected earnings in a range of $5.80 and $6.05 per share on consolidated net sales between $26.19 billion and $26.44 billion, based on a low single-digit increase in same-store sales and 3.4% square footage growth.
The Street is looking for earnings of $5.59 per share on sales of $26.26 billion for the year.
The company also announced the addition of a $1.25 price point for all Dollar Tree stores across the U.s. by the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2022. This new pricing strategy will enable the Company to reintroduce many customer favorites and key traffic-driving products that were previously discontinued due to the constraints of the $1.00 price point.
The company said the continuing expansion of its key strategic initiatives, including Dollar Tree Plus, Combo Stores and the H2 format, are all going well and on, or ahead of, plan.
For the third quarter, net income declined to $216.8 million or $0.96 per share from $330.0 million or $1.39 per share in the prior-year quarter. Consolidated net sales for the quarter increased 3.9 percent to $6.42 billion from $6.18 billion in the same quarter last year. Enterprise same-store sales increased 1.6 percent.
Analysts expected earnings of $0.96 per share on sales of $6.41 billion for the quarter.

2021-11-23 00:00:00+00:00,Why Dollar Tree Stock Is Soaring Today,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-dollar-tree-stock-is-soaring-today,,,"What happened
Shares of discount retailer Dollar Tree (NASDAQ: DLTR) traded 11.5% higher at 3 p.m. ET on Tuesday, following a solid third-quarter earnings report and an important business strategy update.
So what
Dollar Tree saw top-line sales rise 3.9% year over year to $6.42 billion. Earnings per share (EPS) fell from $1.39 to $0.96, but sales and earnings figures both exceeded Wall Street's consensus estimates. Your average analyst firm would have settled for EPS of $0.95 on sales in the neighborhood of $6.41 billion.
Looking ahead to the holiday quarter, management posted earnings guidance in line with the current Street view, but the midpoint of Dollar Tree's revenue target range stopped at $7.1 billion, far ahead of the consensus $6.41 billion estimate.

Now what
The company also updated its operating model. Most of the inventory at every Dollar Tree store is stepping away from the namesake $1 price point. The new standard price of $1.25 per item has proven to lift revenue without lowering the foot traffic in selected testing stores, so the higher prices are rolling out across the whole store network.
Higher prices will also allow the company to bring back some customer favorites that were canceled due to high production and distribution costs.
""We've been able to manage through inflationary periods to maintain the 'Everything for $1' philosophy that distinguished Dollar Tree and made it one of the most successful retail concepts for three decades,"" CEO Mike Witynski said on the earnings call. ""However, we strongly believe this is the appropriate time to shift away from the constraints of the $1 price point in order to continue offering extreme value to our customers.""
The upcoming holiday shopping season will either confirm or refute the wisdom of Dollar Tree's price-lifting strategy. The company is making this radical move from a position of strength, as the stock trades at all-time highs today while revenue is trending relentlessly higher.
Ironically, Dollar Tree's stock isn't all that affordable at 25 times trailing earnings. That's OK because we're looking at a well-run company with an inviting market position in this unstable coronavirus economy. As Dollar Tree hopes to prove over the holidays, sometimes you get what you pay for, and the higher price could be worthwhile.

U.S. stock markets are closed Thursday for the Thanksgiving holiday and trading will end early on Friday. However, there's still plenty of action packed into the three days leading up to the holiday, with Best Buy (BBY, $136.81) among several retail companies set to report earnings.

According to the earnings calendar, the big box retailer will unveil its third-quarter report ahead of Tuesday's open. Shares have been racing higher since early October â up roughly 30% to trade in record-high territory â and a positive reaction to earnings could keep the wind at the consumer stock's back.
Analysts, on average, are looking for Best Buy to report an 8.3% year-over-year decline in earnings to $1.89 per share. Revenue is also expected to take a step back, with the $11.53 billion expected down 2.3% from what the company reported a year ago.  
Still, UBS analyst Michael Lasser (Neutral) feels Best Buy is ""well positioned to report another set of solid results in the third quarter, even as it faces steep compares.""
He also believes Best Buy ""continued to execute on a favorable industry backdrop in the third quarter"" and that ""strong vendor relationships"" have been critical to the company navigating global supply chain disruptions.
However, ""The key for BBY's investment case is how will it perform into 2022 when spending is likely to shift away from the consumer electronics category,"" Lasser says. ""Its strategies can likely cushion the impact."" Among these strategies is the company's recently launched Totaltech around-the-clock tech support membership program, which he believes ""offers good near-term potential.""
Argus Research analyst Chris Graja (Hold) admits the company is facing some major challenges â COVID-19 disruptions, strong competition, and product innovation that is consolidating music, gaming and computing into lower-margin devices like smartphones and tablets, for instance â but it has also positioned itself well for the long term. 
""Best Buy's online capabilities and curbside service are helping the company through the COVID-19 crisis,"" Graja writes in a note. ""We see this as a validation of the company's investments in its e-commerce infrastructure and management's ability to adapt.""

Oppenheimer analyst Brian Nagel agrees. 
""BBY performed well through the coronavirus crisis and capitalized upon stepped-up demand for consumer electronics and home office-type products, as workers and students adapted quickly to hybrid or fully at-home models,"" he says. 
Nagel currently has a Perform (Hold) rating on BBY, but adds that he is ""optimistic that as pandemic pressures continue to subside that a more-efficient and potentially more-profitable Best Buy model should emerge.""
Mantle Ridge Stake Grabs Attention Ahead of Dollar Tree Earnings
Dollar Tree (DLTR, $134.24) made headlines recently on reports activist investor Mantle Ridge took a stake in the discount retailer. The news was well-received on Wall Street, with DLTR stock surging more than 14% in reaction.
According to the Wall Street Journal â which first reported the story â Mantle Ridge is planning to push for pricing strategy changes at DLTR's Family Dollar chain.
""This investor has a history of being deeply involved in situations where companies have been transformed through operational improvements,"" says UBS analyst Michael Lasser (Buy). ""The bottom line is that this development should mean that DLTR will now be held more accountable for producing consistent results. In this case, the upside potential for the shares is significant.""
Deutsche Bank analyst Krisztina Katai (Buy) agrees. She recently lifted her price target on DLTR to $146 from $96, saying ""the added element of a new large shareholder with a clear focus on unlocking meaningful value by closing the profitability gap between Family Dollar and Dollar General (DG) should lead to a more patient investor base with a longer-term focus."" 
She adds that this now creates ""one of the most compelling retail stories with an exciting narrative change underway.""
But what about DLTR's third-quarter earnings report, due out ahead of the Nov. 23 open? Analysts, on average, are expecting earnings to arrive at 96 cents per share, down 30.9% on a year-over-year (YoY) basis. Revenues, meanwhile, are projected to rise 3.7% to $6.41 billion.
Deere Earnings Expectations Lowered After UAW Strike
Deere (DE, $348.84), which is famous for its tractors and riding lawn mowers, will report fiscal fourth-quarter earnings ahead of Wednesday's open. 
""Similar to peers and consistent with retail trends, we believe DE results will reflect continued strong end-market demand, handicapped by production constraints as supply chain and labor dynamics worsened late in the quarter,"" says Oppenheimer analyst Kristen Owen.
One part of the labor dynamics she refers to is month-long strike by thousands of Deere workers that began in mid-October after the company failed to reach an agreement with the United Auto Workers (UAW). The dispute was resolved on Nov. 17, when UAW members approved a new six-year contract that includes a 10% pay increase and $8,500 bonus, according to press reports.
However, the impact of the strike prompted Owen to lower her estimates for fiscal fourth-quarter earnings per share to $3.89 from $4.02 and revenue to $11.1 billion from $11.6 billion.  
Nevertheless, ""we remain constructive on DE shares as we see secular tailwinds persisting and unaccounted-for upside in construction"" due in part to the recent passage of the infrastructure spending bill in D.C. Owen has an Outperform rating on Deere, which is the equivalent of a Buy.
The pros, on average, are looking for $10.49 billion in revenues (+21.1% YoY) and earnings of $3.95 per share, which is 65.3% higher than the year-ago figure.

The indexes are both in solidly positive territory as the retailing sector prepares to welcome shoppers during its peak holiday shopping season.
In the meantime, there are several earnings reports on the way over the next few trading days that might drive bigger market moves. Let's take a closer look at a few highly anticipated announcements from this list, by Zoom Video Communications (NASDAQ: ZM), Best Buy (NYSE: BBY), and Dollar Tree (NASDAQ: DLTR).
Image source: Getty Images.
1. Zoom's big contracts
Zoom shares have been sliding in the months following its late-August earnings report. Investors soured on the video communication specialist as sales growth slowed following soaring results during the earlier phases of the pandemic. But that trend could start to shift with its Monday announcement.
Sales in Q3 are expected to rise roughly 30%, which would mark Zoom's second straight quarter of over $1 billion in revenue. The company is likely to show solid earnings and cash flow results, too. But keep an eye on Zoom's customer growth, especially in its large contract niche. The company needs to expand quickly in this arena if its going to offset slowing growth in the online segment as people return to the workplace.
In the meantime, look for CEO Eric Yuan and his team to update shareholders on Zoom's short-term outlook. Heading into Monday's report, they had been predicting sales will rise roughly 50% to $4 billion for the full fiscal year.
2. Best Buy's holiday outlook
Retailing fans love following Best Buy's third quarter announcement since it usually occurs near the peak holiday shopping period. Set for Tuesday, just three days before Black Friday this year, that report promises to include some timely information about shopper demand and supply chain challenges.
Best Buy might announce a slight sales decline as it goes up against some unusually tough comparisons with surging demand a year ago. Revenue is predicted to drop around 2% this quarter, year-over-year. But look for executives to highlight the two-year growth pace, which describes a business that's seeing fantastic gains. Sales last quarter were up 24% on a two-year basis, and operating income doubled .
All eyes on Tuesday will be on the holiday outlook that Best Buy issues just a few days before the traditional start of the peak shopping season for consumer electronics and home gadgets. A bullish forecast might help shares continue outpacing the market, especially if profit margins continue marching toward 10% of sales.
3. Dollar Tree's strategic plans
Dollar Tree's stock is surging ahead of its Tuesday earnings announcement. But that boost has little to do with that upcoming report. Instead, the retailer sparked new Wall Street interest as an activist investor takes a huge state in the business.
Mantle Ridge is reportedly agitating for management to make some sweeping changes to its value-based selling approach, including by offering a wider selection of higher-priced products. That strategy has worked well for some other retailers lately, including Five Below. But it could risk alienating customers.
Executives should address any evolving plans in Tuesday's announcement, along with issuing a more concrete outlook for the holiday shopping season ahead. But the retailer's ability to generate solid returns for investors might depend on how well the management team can navigate through this strategic shake-up into 2022.

Shares of Dollar Tree (NASDAQ: DLTR) surged 14% on Monday after a respected investment firm took a large stake in the company.
So what
Activist investor Mantle Ridge wants to drive changes at Dollar Tree that it believes will make the retailer's stock more valuable, according to The Wall Street Journal. To jump-start that process, Mantle Ridge acquired a $1.8 billion stake in Dollar Tree.
Mantle Ridge reportedly wants Dollar Tree to strengthen its lagging Family Dollar chain, which it purchased in 2015. To assist with strategy development, Mantle Ridge enlisted Richard Dreiling, who previously served as CEO of rival Dollar General.
Mantle Ridge is also said to want Dollar Tree to roll out its new higher-price strategy to more of its stores. The retailer announced in September that it would sell more items priced above $1 in some of its locations.

Now what
Selling some products at higher price points will make it easier for Dollar Tree to offer a broader selection of goods. This, in turn, could increase sales and help the retailer better manage its rising labor, shipping, and raw material costs.
Analysts applauded Mantle Ridge's reported plans, which are now more likely to be accelerated due to pressure from the activist investor. For one, UBS analyst Michael Lasser boosted his price forecast for Dollar Tree's shares from $120 to $130. He also reiterated his buy rating on the stock after Mantle Ridge disclosed its stake following the Journal's report.
Investors can expect to hear more about how Dollar Tree plans to work with Mantle Ridge to boost shareholder value during its third-quarterearnings conference call which is scheduled for 9 a.m. EST on Nov. 23.

NEW YORK, Nov 15 (Reuters) - Wall Street indexes closed out Monday's session near the unchanged mark as rising Treasury yields dented the appetite for technology stocks, while Boeing shares advanced on signs of demand for its freighter aircraft.
The technology .SPLRCT sector, down 0.11%, was among the biggest drags on the day as U.S. Treasury yields moved higher, with the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note US10YT=RR touching its highest level since Oct. 27. Higher Treasury yields tend to weigh on high-growth areas such as tech, as they discount future earnings from the sector.
Bank stocks .SPXBK, which benefit from climbing yields, advanced with bond yields on the rise as investors positioned for the potential effects of the Federal Reserve's tapering of its massive asset purchases and ahead of a scheduled sale of new 20-year bonds later in the week.
""Wall Street is completely fixated over what is happening in the bond market. We are starting to see yields are rising and that will, ultimately, signal that there's a lot more nervousness that the Fed could be a little bit late to the game on delivering a rate hike and will be forced to react a lot quicker, given the inflationary pressures,"" said Ed Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA.
""You're seeing mixed trade right now because, while a lot of traders are focused on whether these inflationary pressures will keep Treasuries or rates climbing, you're also seeing manufacturing improve in the Empire State and a lot more optimism from abroad.""
Data on Monday showed manufacturing activity in New York surged to 30.9 in November, well above the prior 19.8 reading and 21.2 estimate.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 12.86 points, or 0.04%, to 36,087.45, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 0.05 point, or flat, to 4,682.80 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 7.11 points, or 0.04%, to 15,853.85.
Focus this week will be on earnings reports from several major retailers including Walmart Inc WMT.N, Target Corp TGT.N, Home Depot Inc HD.N and Macy's Inc M.N. Their results will round off an upbeat third-quarter earnings season, which helped push Wall Street to new highs.
Retail sales data for October is also due on Tuesday, and is expected to reveal signs of any impact inflation has had on consumer spending.
Boeing Co BA.N, up 5.49%, was the top boost to the Dow Jones Industrials as the stock closed at a three-month high after Emirates airline announced an order for two 777 Freighters and as Saudi Arabian Airlines was in talks with the planemaker for a wide-body jet order.
The Dubai Airshow event is the first major aerospace conference since the pandemic decimated passenger air travel, with investors watching to see how the industry is coping with new dynamics.
Electric-car maker Tesla Inc TSLA.O fell 1.94% after Chief Executive Elon Musk engaged in a dispute with Bernie Sanders as the U.S. senator demanded the wealthy pay their ""fair share"" of taxes.
Tesla's declines follow a steep drop of 15.4% last week after Musk offloaded a combined $6.9 billion worth of shares in the company.
The S&P materials sector .SPLRCM, down 0.46%, was among the worst-performing sectors for the session on signs of weakness in China's property sector, a key driver of global metal demand, which weighed on miners.
Dollar Tree Inc DLTR.O jumped 14.28% and was the top percentage gainer on the S&P 500 .SPX after activist investor Mantle Ridge LP revealed a 5.7% stake in the discount retailer.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.22-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.26-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted 50 new 52-week highs and 3 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 129 new highs and 127 new lows.
Volume on U.S. exchanges was 9.56 billion shares, compared with the 10.96 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

NEW YORK, Nov 15 (Reuters) - Wall Street indexes closed out Monday's session near the unchanged mark as rising Treasury yields dented the appetite for technology stocks, while Boeing shares advanced on signs of demand for its freighter aircraft.
The technology .SPLRCT sector was among the biggest drags on the day as U.S. Treasury yields moved higher, with the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note US10YT=RR touching its highest level since Oct. 27. Higher Treasury yields tend to weigh on high-growth areas such as tech, as they discount future earnings from the sector.
Bank stocks .SPXBK, which benefit from climbing yields, advanced with bond yields on the rise as investors positioned for the potential effects of the Federal Reserve's tapering of its massive asset purchases.
""Wall Street is completely fixated over what is happening in the bond market. We are starting to see yields are rising and that will, ultimately, signal that there's a lot more nervousness that the Fed could be a little bit late to the game on delivering a rate hike and will be forced to react a lot quicker, given the inflationary pressures,"" said Ed Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA.
""You're seeing mixed trade right now because, while a lot of traders are focused on whether these inflationary pressures will keep Treasuries or rates climbing, you're also seeing manufacturing improve in the Empire State and a lot more optimism from abroad.""
Data on Monday showed manufacturing activity in New York surged to 30.9 in November, well above the prior 19.8 reading and 21.2 estimate.
According to preliminary data, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 0.12 points, or 0.00%, to end at 4,682.88 points, while the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC lost 4.86 points, or 0.04%, to 15,853.85. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 8.38 points, or 0.03%, to 36,091.93.
Focus this week will be on earnings reports from several major retailers including Walmart Inc WMT.N, Target Corp TGT.N, Home Depot Inc HD.N and Macy's Inc M.N. Their results will round off an upbeat third-quarter earnings season, which helped push Wall Street to new highs.
Retail sales data for October is also due on Tuesday, and is expected to reveal signs of any impact inflation has had on consumer spending.

Thanks to the barrage of consumer-focused news due in the stock market this week, cyclical stocks continue to gain momentum. For starters, what are cyclical stocks, might you ask? Well, simply put, they are stocks that tend to grow alongside the economy. As such, you have both consumer discretionary players and industrial giants to consider in this group of stocks. This week, however, the focus will likely be on the retail side of things. For the most part, this would be thanks to the U.S. Commerce Departmentâs October retail sales report due tomorrow.
Overall, the report will serve to provide crucial insight into consumer spending trends going into the holiday season. Arguably, Chinaâs results on this front could be contributing to positive investor sentiment on the matter now. To point out, China saw its retail sales surge by 4.9%, smashing consensus projections of 3.5% growth. At the same time, things appear to be lifting off for cyclical companies like Boeing (NYSE: BA) and Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) as well. On one hand, Boeing claims that it is âgetting closeâ to resuming deliveries off its flagship aircraft. On the other hand, Netflix is reportedly making plans for season 2 of its blowout series Squid Game. Overall, there are plenty of top cyclical stocks to consider in the stock market today. Here are five to watch now.
5 Top Cyclical Stocks To Buy [Or Sell] This Week

This latest rally seems to come after activist investor Mantle Ridge took a stake in the company. The Wall Street Journal reports that Mantle Ridge wants Dollar Tree to take action to boost its stock price and is focusing on pricing strategies at the companyâs Family Dollar chain. This news also prompted Deutsche Bank to upgrade the stock to a Buy rating, citing potential improvements. Analyst Krisztina Katai says that the added element of a new large shareholder with a clear focus on unlocking meaningful value by closing the profitability gap between Dollar General and Family Dollar should lead to a more patient investor base with a longer-term focus. Given this exciting piece of news, should you be paying close attention to DLTR stock today?

Next is GameStop, a cyclical company that is a consumer electronics and gaming merchandise retailer. In fact, the company is one of the largest video game retailers in the world.

Walt Disney Company
Another name to consider in the cyclical trade would be Disney. In theory, the companyâs vast array of entertainment offerings could make it a go-to for investors now. To begin with, Disneyâs premium tourist attractions and services would be on the rise as travel restrictions continue to ease. From its Disneyland resorts to its cruise operations, Disney brings plenty to the table on this front. Alternatively, the companyâs Disney+ streaming service continues to cater to less adventurous consumers staying home amidst the current pandemic.
Even with all of this, DIS stock is currently looking at year-to-date losses of about 10%. With the companyâs shares trading at $158.35 as of 12:45 p.m. ET, could it be worth jumping on? For one thing, the companyâs work with the Marvel cinematic universe (MCU) appears to be far from over. Firstly, its latest MCU blockbuster Eternals topped domestic box offices in its second weekend. Secondly, Disney revealed a slate of new series related to both the MCU and Star Wars franchises on its Disney Plus day last week. As Disney continues to dominate the entertainment scene, could DIS stock be a top buy for you?

Last but not least, we will be looking at the Carnival Corporation. By and large, most investors eyeing the travel industry now would be familiar with Carnival.

In terms of its U.S. operations, Carnival currently has 24 ships that can sail from 14 U.S. homeports.
Notably, CCL stock remains a hot pick among investors looking to bet on the reopening trade. It currently trades at $22.32 as of 12:45 p.m. ET after gaining by over 150% since its pandemic era low. Even so, Carnival does not seem to be slowing down anytime soon. As of yesterday, the company resumed guest operations from Tampa with its Carnival Pride ship. This would be part of Carnivalâs plans to fully resume its U.S. operations by March 2022. Given all of this, will you be adding CCL stock to your portfolio?

Nov 15 (Reuters) - U.S. stock indexeswere set to rise on Monday as economically resilient sectorsbenefited from inflation jitters, while investors awaited a slew of retail earnings and economic data this week to gauge the health of consumer spending.
The three major Wall Street indexes had fallen between 0.3% and 0.7% last week on concerns over high inflation and weakening consumer sentiment. Investors had begun pivoting into growth sectors, mainly technology, towards the end of the week.
Market-heavy FAANG stocks rose between 0.2% and 0.8% in premarket trade, with Meta Platforms Inc FB.O leading gains.
""(What) you're seeing with the value-growth trade is a term that you use in football - happy feet. Investors are ready to sort of abandon one and switch into the other when they get some kind of news on inflation,"" said Robert Pavlik, senior portfolio manager at Dakota Wealth in Fairfield, Connecticut.
Electric carmaker Tesla Inc TSLA.O lagged its tech peers, dropping 2.2% after chief Elon Musk got into a spat with Bernie Sanders as the U.S. senator demanded the wealthy pay their ""fair share"" of taxes.
Tesla's declines follow a steep 15.4% drop last week after Musk offloaded a combined $6.9 billion worth of shares in the electric-car maker.
Focus this week will be on earnings reports from several major retailers including Walmart Inc WMT.N, Target Corp TGT.N, Home Depot Inc HD.N and Macy's Inc M.N. Their results will round off an upbeat third-quarter earnings season, which pushed Wall Street to new highs.
Retail sales data for October is also due on Tuesday, and is expected to show the impact of inflation on consumer spending.
""Inflation is probably going to end up helping (retailers) somewhat because some of these big-box companies are able to ... raise prices and maintain pretty close to their margin levels,"" Dakota Wealth's Pavlik added.

2021-11-15 00:00:00+00:00,Here Are 2 Must-Watch Nasdaq Stocks Monday Morning,DLTR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/here-are-2-must-watch-nasdaq-stocks-monday-morning-2021-11-15,,,"Stocks have been on a record run lately, and the Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) has continued to move to all-time highs recently. Coming into a new week, the Nasdaq looked poised to keep posting gains, with futures up about a quarter percent to 16,234 as of 8 a.m. EST.
A big part of what has driven the Nasdaq higher lately has been a rising interest in stocks other than the tech behemoths that many investors focus on. That was evident from a big rise in Dollar Tree (NASDAQ: DLTR) shares, which looked poised to hit an all-time high of their own. Yet there was also some disappointing news this morning, as Oatly Group (NASDAQ: OTLY) wasn't able to meet the high expectations of its shareholders. We'll look at both companies below.
Oatly shares get soggy
Oatly Group saw its stock drop almost 14% in premarket trading on Monday, putting it on pace for its worst levels since going public earlier this year. The plant-based dairy company's third-quarter financial report raised concerns about the sustainability of its growth even as consumers remained interested in its products.
Image source: Oatly.
Oatly's release for the third quarter featured some encouraging numbers. Revenue rose 49% year over year to $171 million, which was a record for the company. Oatly cited strength both in retail and in food-service distribution channels, especially with restaurants seeing pandemic-related restrictions continue to ease in some parts of the world. Production jumped 77% to 131 million liters.
However, Oatly saw pressure in other areas. Gross margin fell more than 5 percentage points to 26.2%, and quarterly losses widened substantially year over year. Oatly cited higher expenses for shipping and logistics, as well as some challenges from seeking to boost its production capacity at its facility in Ogden, Utah. The company expects gross margin to rise above 40% in the long run, but it needs to reach its economies of scale first. Exactly how long that will take remains a question, and until investors have answers, they seem to lack confidence in the stock's ability to move upward.
Dollar Tree gets interest
On the upside, shares of Dollar Tree were higher by more than 6% in premarket trading. That would be enough to send the retail stock to an all-time high if it opened at or above that level.
Late Friday, regulatory filings indicated that an activist investor has taken a substantial position in the dollar-store retailer. Mantle Ridge reportedly has invested $1.8 billion in Dollar Tree, and there's ample speculation about how the institutional activist will look to get the company to take steps to enhance shareholder performance and unlock its full value.
Following the move, Dollar Tree shares got upgrades from a few stock analysts on Wall Street. Deutsche Bank and R5 Capital boosted their ratings on the stock from hold to buy, while J.P. Morgan added Dollar Tree to its analyst focus list.
Dollar Tree has dramatically underperformed rival Dollar General (NYSE: DG) over the past several years, with its Family Dollar unit in particular seeing some challenges. If Mantle Ridge can help Dollar Tree get past its obstacles and tap fully into the potential available in dollar-store retail, then shareholders could see the company catch up quickly to its chief competitor and deliver strong returns for investors.
