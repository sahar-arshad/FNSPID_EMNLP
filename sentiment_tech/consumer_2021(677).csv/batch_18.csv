It’s paid to follow meme stocks. Several obscure names skyrocketed this year. But now that the momentum is dissipating, value investors have the opportunity to pick their spots. One name that should be on everyone’s radar is ContextLogic (NASDAQ:WISH) stock, which has shed 24.5% of value in the last month.

ContextLogic is an e-commerce play targeting the value-conscious consumer.
In 2020, global retail e-commerce sales amounted to $4.28 trillion and were expected to grow to $5.4 trillion in 2022 per Statista.
A large chunk of these numbers will represent the value-conscious consumer, which is not looking for luxury or high standard, rather a bargain with satisfactory quality. This is a competitive advantage for ContextLogic over larger peers.

7 Coronavirus Stocks to Buy as the Delta Variant Rises
On top of this, as Mark Hake points out in this excellent article, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) and eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) all are significantly more expensive than ContextLogic, which is just the right price after a near-30% drop.
WISH Stock: An Exciting E-Commerce Play at a Discount
In 2020, ContextLogic’s discovery-focused app was also one of the most downloaded shopping apps in the U.S., ranking third behind Amazon and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) with 30 million downloads.
Globally, it finished behind Amazon and Shopee, a Singaporean e-commerce online shopping platform popular in Southeast Asia and Taiwan.
Per an S-1 filing,  the company connects more than 100 million monthly active users in over 100 countries to over 500,000 merchants offering roughly 150 million items from mostly Chinese vendors.
A vast majority of purchases take place through the mobile app. This is a great model to attract and cater to lower-income consumers that may only have internet access through their phones.
Moreover, 75% of WISH users have a household income below $75,000. So, investors worried that high-end products do not feature prominently on the app should rest easy.
WISH benefits from an asset-light model and a user-driven platform. Customers can take advantage of a scrollable personalized feed tailored to consumer interests.
Per the 2020 WISH 10-K filing, over 70% of sales involve zero search queries. And with WISH spending 67% of its 2020 revenue on marketing and sales, expect this number to keep growing as the e-commerce company maximizes the average revenue per user (ARPU).
Chinese Vendors Not a Cause for Concern
One concern investors may have when pouring their capital into WISH stock could be the sale of potentially low-quality products offered by merchants.
Nothing erodes trust like faulty products, but the company has you covered there as well.
ContextLogic has grown its monthly active users (MAUs) to 108 million in 2020 from just 21 million MAUs since 2015. The bedrock of this growth has been an ever-evolving quality control process. ContextLogic requires extensive documents and verification to register merchants and is cracking down on counterfeit goods.
Concerns regarding potential escalation in the U.S.-China trade war are real, but the present administration is employing a softer approach.
Fairly Valued
ContextLogic’s sell-off is a great opportunity to increase exposure to a fast-growing e-commerce performer at a discount. The upside is too good to ignore. Almost all business verticals are expected to grow multifold in the next few years.
The company has $2 billion in cash post-IPO and no long-term debt. Most of its liabilities are current, so there are no liquidity issues in the near term. ContextLogic is also close to turning cash flow positive.
Competition in e-commerce is tough, but Millennials and workforce-entering Gen Z looking for affordable products are a huge demographic.
With extreme bargains, a “treasure hunt” experience, and an easy-to-use app, they will continue to flock to ContextLogic. It goes without saying that this will lead to substantial revenue and margin growth. WISH stock will, in turn, be a net beneficiary.
Reddit mania propelled shares to $15 from a 52-week loss of $7.52 per share. Considering a short interest of 18.9%, investors should not hold their breath for another short squeeze. But if they are looking for a long-term investment, WISH stock is a tantalizing option among a sea of overpriced tech stocks.

2021-08-05 00:00:00+00:00,Interesting EBAY Put And Call Options For September 24th,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/interesting-ebay-put-and-call-options-for-september-24th-2021-08-05,,,"Investors in eBay Inc. (Symbol: EBAY) saw new options become available today, for the September 24th expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the EBAY options chain for the new September 24th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $66.00 strike price has a current bid of $2.74. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $66.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $63.26 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of EBAY, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $66.99/share today.
Because the $66.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 100%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 4.15% return on the cash commitment, or 30.31% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for eBay Inc., and highlighting in green where the $66.00 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $68.00 strike price has a current bid of $2.54. If an investor was to purchase shares of EBAY stock at the current price level of $66.99/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $68.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 5.30% if the stock gets called away at the September 24th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if EBAY shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for eBay Inc., as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing EBAY's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $68.00 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $68.00 strike represents an approximate 2% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 3.79% boost of extra return to the investor, or 27.68% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.
Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $66.99) to be 35%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

2021-08-04 00:00:00+00:00,Should PayPal Investors Be Worried About Square's Afterpay Takeover?,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/should-paypal-investors-be-worried-about-squares-afterpay-takeover-2021-08-04,,,"Square (NYSE: SQ) recently agreed to buy Afterpay (OTC: AFTP.F), an Australian ""buy now, pay later"" (BNPL) service provider, for $29 billion in stock. The deal represents a premium of 21.9% over Afterpay's ten-day weighted average share price, and values the company at 25 times this year's sales.
Square's stock rallied following the announcement, which accompanied a solid second-quarter report on Aug. 1 that beat analysts' expectations. Meanwhile, shares of its rival PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL), which had already been sliding following its mixed second-quarter report on July 28, fell even further after Square posted its earnings report and announced the Afterpay deal.
Image source: Getty Images.
Square's takeover of Afterpay counters PayPal's ""Pay in 4"" BNPL service, which it launched last August. Both Afterpay and Pay in 4 let customers pay for goods in four interest-free payments, but Square plans to integrate Afterpay into both its Seller ecosystem and its rapidly growing Cash App, which already provides peer-to-peer payments, bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) purchases, and stock trading services.
Should PayPal's investors worry about Square's latest move? Or is there enough room for both companies and their other rivals to thrive in the expanding BNPL market?
Why is Square paying a premium for Afterpay?
Square's takeover of Afterpay, which will close in the first quarter of calendar 2022, initially seems pricey. It will pay nearly a quarter of its market cap -- and significantly dilute its existing shares with an all-stock transaction -- for a company that will likely only boost its 2022 revenue by about 5%.
Afterpay's revenue rose 78% in fiscal 2021, which ended in June, but Square's revenue surged 101% in 2020 and is expected to rise 102% this year. Therefore, Square seems to be paying a high premium and diluting its shares for a company that generates slower growth.
However, Square's growth in 2020 and most of 2021 was largely driven by bitcoin trades during the pandemic. If we exclude those bitcoin sales, Square's revenue only rose 17% in 2020, and analysts expect its total revenue to grow just 13% in 2022 as those cryptocurrency trades normalize.
However, they still expect Afterpay's revenue to rise 66% in fiscal 2022 -- so it could generate smoother growth than Square's volatile core business. Afterpay would also expand Square's overseas presence, since it only generates about half of its underlying sales in the United States.
Afterpay's active customers grew 63% to 16.1 million in 2021, and it serves nearly 100,000 merchants worldwide. Square's Cash App hit 40 million active customers in June, up from 36 million at the end of 2020. Merging those two high-growth platforms together -- and adding Afterpay's BNPL services to its platforms -- could significantly expand Square's ecosystem.
Should PayPal be concerned?
PayPal was already in a vulnerable position after its second-quarter revenue growth and third-quarter revenue forecast missed Wall Street's expectations. It also warned that its loss of eBay to its Dutch rival Adyen -- which concludes its three-year transition this year -- will throttle its near-term revenue growth.
That slowdown raises doubts about PayPal's ambitious plans to more than double its annual revenue by 2025, as well as concerns about its recent decision to hike its processing fees for U.S. merchants.
PayPal operates in over 200 markets worldwide, and its number of active accounts rose 16% year-over-year to 403 million in the second quarter. Its peer-to-peer payments app Venmo serves more than 50 million active users.
PayPal repeatedly cited its BNPL service as a growth engine during its latest conference call. Over seven million consumers have used its BNPL service for more than 20 million transactions so far. The service has processed more than $3.5 billion in TPV (total payment volume) since its launch, with $1.5 billion of that total processed in the second quarter alone.
That figure sounds impressive, but $1.5 billion only accounted for 0.5% of PayPal's total TPV of $311 billion during the quarter. It also reveals its Pay in 4 platform is still much smaller than Afterpay -- which generated $15.6 billion in underlying sales (comparable to PayPal's TPV) in fiscal 2021.
PayPal previously offered ""pay later"" options with its revolving credit line and an Easy Payments feature, but ""Pay in 4"" marked its first step into the streamlined, interest-free BNPL market. But it arrived late to the party -- Afterpay was founded in 2014, while its Australian rival Zip was founded in 2013.
The bottom line
On its own, Square's takeover of Afterpay won't derail PayPal's long-term growth. Bank of America estimates the market for BNPL apps will expand 10-15 fold by 2025, so there could be plenty of room for Square and PayPal to expand without trampling each other.
However, Square's massive acquisition of Afterpay, which instantly gives it a bigger share of the BNPL market than PayPal, highlights the key difference between the two fintech giants.
Square is consistently more daring -- as seen with its early moves in bitcoin trades, stock trades, and the expansion of its seller services -- while PayPal is more conservative. Therefore, investors should question why PayPal didn't buy Afterpay first -- and if it needs to get more aggressive to hit its lofty growth targets for 2025.

2021-08-04 00:00:00+00:00,3 Reasons PayPal Stock Is a Buy After Earnings,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-reasons-paypal-stock-is-a-buy-after-earnings-2021-08-04,,,"PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ: PYPL) continued to experience strong momentum on its platform in the second quarter. While growth in total payment volume decelerated from the first quarter, it's still growing faster than pre-pandemic levels.
Investors were focused on management's weak guidance for Q3, which sent the stock down 10% after the earnings report was released. But investors are missing management's comments during theearnings callthat growth could reaccelerate heading into 2022.
Here are three reasons why the stock sell-off following the earnings report is a good buying opportunity.
Image source: PayPal Holdings.
1. Non-eBay payment volume up 48%
The weak guidance and subsequent sell-off stems from eBay. PayPal separated from eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY) in 2015, and over the last few years, eBay has been transitioning to its own managed payments system. In Q2 2016, the payment volume coming from eBay's marketplaces comprised 17% of PayPal's payment volume. It now only totals 4% of PayPal's volume. This steady decline has pressured PayPal's revenue growth.
PayPal expects Q3 revenue to grow approximately 12% to 14% year over year on a currency-neutral basis, which is a meaningful deceleration from 17% in Q2.
The deceleration that eBay's marketplaces are experiencing coming out of the pandemic is making it worse on PayPal. In the last quarter, eBay's marketplace payment volume completed through PayPal declined 41% on a currency-neutral basis. This cut approximately eight percentage points off PayPal's payment volume growth in the second quarter.
Excluding eBay, however, PayPal's core business is growing much faster than the reported numbers suggest. PayPal's non-eBay payment volume grew 48% year over year in the second quarter on a spot basis, compared to the 40% that PayPal reported. PayPal CEO Dan Schulman sees growth accelerating once eBay is fully phased out and said so during the Q2 2021earnings call
We now expect that eBay will be essentially 100% complete with their migration to managed payments by the end of the third quarter. We are maintaining our full-year guidance despite the fact that this accelerated ramp puts an additional 100 basis points of revenue pressure in 2021. The good news is that this pressure begins to ease in Q4 and, obviously, positions us for accelerated revenue growth in 2022.
2. Customer engagement accelerating
PayPal is now starting to reap the rewards of the millions of new users that joined the platform during the pandemic. Over the last three years, transactions per account have increased from 35.7 to 43.5. Since Q3 2020, this important engagement metric has accelerated from 1% growth to 11% in Q2 2021.
""We continue to see strong demand for our in-store services with approximately 1.3 million merchants now accepting our QR codes and continued momentum and excitement across our large enterprise merchants,"" Schulman said.
3. Non-eBay revenue grew 32%
The higher engagement directly impacts revenue growth, since it leads to growth in total transactions and more processing fees. PayPal's ex-eBay revenue growth came to 32% in Q2 -- an 11-point acceleration over the year-ago quarter.
Excluding the impact of eBay, PayPal's growth in payment volume, transactions per account, and revenue look fantastic, and next year should be even better.
Looking ahead, PayPal is planning to release a new digital wallet ""super app"" that will feature improved bill pay functionality, direct deposit, and high-yield savings. This is a big catalyst that could send the share price higher.
This growth stock is down because PayPal is guiding for a few percentage points lower revenue growth in the next quarter than investors wanted to see, even though management made it clear that the business could very well reaccelerate in 2022. Investors should ignore the short-term noise and look at the sell-off as a buying opportunity.

2021-08-02 00:00:00+00:00,Dorsey-led $29 bln deal delivers prompt payday for Afterpay founders,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/dorsey-led-%2429-bln-deal-delivers-prompt-payday-for-afterpay-founders-2021-08-02,,,"By Byron Kaye
SYDNEY, Aug 2 (Reuters) - A tweet by Kim Kardashian promoting Afterpay APT.AX as a way to buy her beauty products may have proved pivotal for the Australian buy now, pay later pioneer, whose founders have since joined the reality TV superstar as billionaires.
Kardashian's recommendation in 2018 helped Afterpay, which has agreed a record $29 billion buyout by Square SQ.N, the payments firm of Twitter TWTR.N founder Jack Dorsey, crack the U.S. market.
Afterpay's rapid rise, which has culminated in Australia's biggest-ever deal and powered its stock market to record highs, began when an eBay EBAY.O vendor noticed young people avoiding credit cards after the 2008 financial crisis.
""It all started from seeing a shift in 2008 of millennials toward debit cards over credit cards,"" Afterpay co-founder Nick Molnar said in a 2020 Reuters interview.
Molnar, 31, sold jewellery from his bedroom while studying commerce at University of Sydney, and he and Melbourne-headquartered Afterpay co-founder Anthony Eisen were neighbours.
He and Eisen, a 49-year-old former fund manager who specialised in tech firms, will each pocket A$2.46 billion ($1.8 billion) from the Dorsey-led deal, and stay on at the company.
Australian media have widely reported that Molnar is the country's youngest self-made billionaire. Alongside Eisen, he was ranked fifth richest among Australian executive directors, the Australian Financial Review reported in July.
The friends' success is built on the idea that they could offer shoppers a small loan that they would pay back in instalments, with the incentive that they could make more purchases if they repaid on time.
Afterpay would take a cut of 4-6% of the shelf price from the merchant, who would use its services to drive business.
They took the business live in 2014, picking up big-name clients like Woolworths WOW.AX, Myer Holdings MYR.AX and Wesfarmers' WES.AX Officeworks.
And just three years later it merged with its technology supplier, Touchcorp, to create an all-in-one service.
From 2017, Afterpay could vet shoppers and direct them to stores, while processing loans and repayments. Due to its low dollar value loans and its appeal to shoppers, Afterpay says it has lower default rates than other consumer loan methods.
However, the ride to riches for Molnar and Eisen has not always been smooth as Afterpay came under regulatory scrutiny both in Australia and the United States.
In 2019 Australia's anti-money laundering agency ordered an independent audit of Afterpay, citing ""concerns with its compliance"" and the rapid growth of buy now, pay later. It was subsequently given the all-clear.
And in 2020, Afterpay paid A$1.5 million to Californian regulators who said it was operating illegally since it started writing business there before it had a licence. The company denied any illegal behaviour.
PANDEMIC PAYDAY
Afterpay bagged a Tencent 0700.HK investment in May 2020, sparking a protracted run-up as investors aligned their portfolios with the Chinese online giant.
And a boom in online shopping during the COVID-19 pandemic, driven by fiscal stimulus cheques, sealed its lofty valuation.
Its shares broke through A$100 in October and by February 2021 had hit A$160.
Although Afterpay has yet to turn a net profit, it is one of Australia's 20 largest companies, alongside financial powerhouse Macquarie MQG.AX and telecoms giant Telstra TLS.AX.
Monday's deal locks in a stock valuation that some analysts have said is overpriced amid uncertainty around the COVID-19 Delta variant, varying levels of government relief funding and warnings that interest rates must rise from record lows.
""It's a market defining transaction. It really moves the needle and validates the work that Afterpay have been doing,"" said Emanuel Datt, founder of Datt Capital which bought Afterpay shares around A$7.00 in 2018 and predicted a buyout this year.

However, that amount of capital is sufficient to buy into many potentially fast-growth tech stocks. With that amount, investors could comfortably buy shares of tech such as eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY), Etsy (NASDAQ: ETSY), and StoneCo (NASDAQ: STNE) and earn outsized returns over time.
Image source: Getty Images
1. eBay
eBay is an old tech darling that fell out of favor amid more favorable, lower-cost service offerings from competitors. However, since e-commerce executive Jamie Iannone returned to the company to become CEO, he has worked to better leverage its base of 187 million buyers, giving investors reasons to consider buying eBay stock.
Iannone has improved its efficiency, shortening eBay's once-cumbersome listing process, enabling storefronts on mobile devices, and adding QR coding for pickups. eBay has also brought more of a digital wallet experience through its managed payments systems. This makes both payments and collections a more efficient process.
Consequently, the company that increased revenue by only 1% in 2019 from year-ago levels grew revenue in 2020 by 19% over the previous year to almost $10.3 billion. Net income rose by nearly 220% during that period to $5.7 billion as operating costs increased only 10%, and eBay earned an additional $700 million from interest and other sources.
Revenue also surged by 42% in the first quarter of 2021 compared with year-ago numbers to reach $3 billion. While net income fell during that period to $641 million, that occurred because the company realized almost $3 billion from discontinued operations in Q1 2020. A 64% increase in the cost of net revenue also hurt profitability, driven mainly by transition costs related to its payments platform.
Such improvements likely helped eBay stock rise 30% over the last year and double since the beginning of 2020. Moreover, the earnings multiple does not reflect this growth. It stands at around 16, lower than other e-commerce companies such as Amazon and its price-to-earnings ratio of 63.
Like other e-commerce companies, eBay issued limited guidance for the second quarter as it emerges from the pandemic. Nonetheless, if it can maintain double-digit revenue increases, eBay stock could easily experience both price growth and multiple expansion over time.
2. Etsy
Etsy stands out because it has become so much more than a sales site. It is a community that exists to bolster sellers of artisan goods, craft supplies, and vintage products. It not only limits its site to these types of businesses, but it also offers its platform to sellers at a low price point, providing a search engine that makes it easier to find specific artisans based on what they sell.
The financials appear to reflect this value proposition. In the first quarter of 2021, revenue grew by 142% versus year-ago levels to $551 million. Since operating expenses increased by 114% and the cost of revenue climbed by only 73%, net income spiked by 1,048% to $144 million during that time.
Full-year 2020 numbers show that the growth is not a one-time event. In 2020, revenue climbed to over $1.7 billion, a 111% increase from 2019. Moreover, since Etsy kept the increases in the cost of revenue and operating expenses well below that pace, net income rose by 264% during that time to $349 million.
Despite these successes, Etsy guided to 12-month revenue growth of 15% to 25% in Q2 and did not release full-year forecasts. This may point to some uncertainty as its markets emerge from the pandemic.
Nonetheless, it has posted 90% stock growth over the last 12 months. It also trades at around 52 times earnings. This comes in lower than the Shopify's current level of 77. Not only does Etsy bring investors an increasingly robust community of small businesses, but it also offers investors exposure to the growth of e-commerce at a reasonable price.
3. StoneCo
Many U.S. investors aren't familiar with StoneCo, since it serves the fintech needs of businesses in Brazil. StoneCo offers solutions for enterprises of all sizes that want to spend and collect money both on and offline. It also provides platforms for the financial management of the businesses themselves. However, unlike a Visa or a PayPal, it gears itself to serve customers in a cash-based society, a niche often overlooked by those with no perspective of how fintech might function in a developing market.
Indeed, peers such as PagSeguro (NYSE: PAGS) and Latin-American e-commerce giant MercadoLibre also serve this market, but StoneCo offers additional competitive advantages. StoneCo prides itself on a ""no bureaucracy"" approach, opening local hubs and training salesforces quickly in areas that need its service.
Thanks in part to this accessible business model, revenue in the first quarter of 2021 of 868 million reais ($168 million) meant year-over-year growth of 21%. Also, StoneCo reported a net income of 158 million reais ($31 million), a decline of 22% over that period. The rising cost of service, administrative expenses, and selling expenses weighed on profitability as Brazil dealt with a second wave of COVID-19.
Still, the company seems to have handled the impact well. In fiscal 2020, revenue of 3.3 billion reais ($640 million) represented a 29% increase from 2019 levels. Net income rose 4% during that time to 837 million reais ($162 million) as technology and marketing costs as well as expenses related to a merger reduced profit growth.
COVID-19 fears have also affected the stock; it has fallen by more than 40% since its February high. However, this has taken its P/E ratio down to just above 112, down from around 165 in February. While it remains more expensive than PagSeguro, which sports a 82 P/E ratio, investors should also remember that PagSeguro's 20% revenue growth in fiscal 2020 slightly lagged StoneCo's revenue increases. Perhaps more importantly, StoneCo increased its net income in 2020 as PagSeguro's net income fell by 6% from year-ago levels. In my mind, StoneCo's superior performance helps justify paying a bit of a premium compared to competitors.
Furthermore, management predicts a ""significant acceleration"" in revenue and net income from 2020 levels. Thus, investors may want to consider StoneCo while they can buy it on a dip.

2021-07-30 00:00:00+00:00,When Should You Buy eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY)?,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/when-should-you-buy-ebay-inc.-nasdaq%3Aebay-2021-07-30,,,"Today we're going to take a look at the well-established eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY). The company's stock received a lot of attention from a substantial price increase on the NASDAQGS over the last few months. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Let’s examine eBay’s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there’s still a bargain opportunity.
Is eBay still cheap?
Great news for investors – eBay is still trading at a fairly cheap price. My valuation model shows that the intrinsic value for the stock is $103.21, but it is currently trading at US$73.41 on the share market, meaning that there is still an opportunity to buy now. However, given that eBay’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.
Can we expect growth from eBay?
NasdaqGS:EBAY Earnings and Revenue Growth July 30th 2021
Future outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Though in the case of eBay, it is expected to deliver a relatively unexciting earnings growth of 1.6%, which doesn’t help build up its investment thesis. Growth doesn’t appear to be a main reason for a buy decision for the company, at least in the near term.
What this means for you:
Are you a shareholder? Even though growth is relatively muted, since EBAY is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to accumulate more of your holdings in the stock. However, there are also other factors such as financial health to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.
Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on EBAY for a while, now might be the time to make a leap. Its future outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy EBAY. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the track record of its management team, in order to make a well-informed investment decision.
If you want to dive deeper into eBay, you'd also look into what risks it is currently facing. While conducting our analysis, we found that eBay has 2 warning signs and it would be unwise to ignore these.

2021-07-29 00:00:00+00:00,Why PayPal Stock Dropped Today,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-paypal-stock-dropped-today-2021-07-29,,,"What happened
Shares of PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ: PYPL) fell 6.2% on Thursday, following the release of the digital payment giant's second-quarter results.
So what
PayPal's net revenue jumped 19% year over year to $6.2 billion, fueled by an 11.4 million increase in active accounts and a 40% surge in total payment volume (TPV). Adjusted earnings per share, however, rose only 8%, due in part to a 1.7 percentage point decline in its operating margin.
Investors sold off PayPal's shares on Thursday. Image source: Getty Images.
Results were dented by eBay's (NASDAQ: EBAY) transition off its payment platform. The loss of the popular online marketplace's business resulted in an 8 percentage point hit to PayPal's payment volumes during the quarter. ""We're now absorbing more pressure from eBay than we had previously expected,"" CFO John Rainey said during a conference call with analysts.
Now what
PayPal warned that eBay's migration off of its platform would continue to hurt results in the coming quarters. Management forecast revenue and EPS of roughly $6.2 billion and $1.07, respectively, in the third quarter. That was below Wall Street's expectations of $6.4 billion in revenue and $1.14 in EPS.
Still, the long-term growth story remains intact. With more retail sales shifting online every day, PayPal's position as a leading provider of digital payment solutions should serve its shareholders well in the decade ahead.
""Our platform now supports 403 million active accounts, with an annualized TPV run rate of approximately $1.25 trillion,"" CEO Dan Schulman said. ""Clearly PayPal has evolved into an essential service in the emerging digital economy.""

2021-07-29 00:00:00+00:00,I'm Buying Etsy in the Next Market Crash. Here's Why,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/im-buying-etsy-in-the-next-market-crash.-heres-why-2021-07-29,,,"E-commerce stocks have made many investors rich. Over the last five years, if you invested in any of today's biggest online retailers -- be it Amazon, Sea Limited, MercadoLibre, or Shopify -- you'd have at least quadrupled your money.
In the coming years, e-commerce companies will only grow as more stores and shoppers head online. Most online retail players are vying to be the next Amazon, hoping to replicate its success or even beat the titan at its own game. But Etsy (NASDAQ: ETSY) is charting its own path to success, and here's how.
Image source: Getty Images.
Not another Amazon wannabe
When it comes to e-commerce, Amazon is the undisputed king of the jungle. In fact, ""how do you compete with Amazon?"" has become an existential question for any up-and-coming online retailer. After all, Amazon offers customers almost everything consumers could ever want: low prices, a vast selection of products, and speedy delivery at little to no cost. And as it grows bigger and bigger, Amazon gets even better at serving online shoppers.
Shoppers indeed demand low prices and reliability from online retail platforms. But they also crave the extraordinary, unique, vintage, or authentic goods that come with a personal touch. And that's exactly what Etsy offers.
Home to millions of sellers, Etsy is on a mission to ""keep commerce human."" Instead of peddling run-of-the-mill goods shipped from a big factory, Etsy's merchants sell tailor-made, one-of-a-kind items. This has made the platform very popular among shoppers looking for custom gifts or something they can't find anywhere else.
Etsy's emphasis on unique, hand-made items makes it hard for traditional online marketplaces -- like Amazon -- to compete. Most e-commerce platforms, after all, focus on selling large numbers of affordable, standardized products, and delivering them as fast as possible.
But Etsy is not that bothered about price or speed. In fact, Etsy's products usually take longer to reach customers, as sellers need extra time to produce custom goods. And judging from Etsy's growth so far, shoppers are not only willing to wait it out, they'll often pay a premium to get a unique, one-off product.
Etsy's massive growth opportunity
Unlike Amazon -- which is well-known as the ""everything store"" -- Etsy seems laser-focused on serving niche markets. But make no mistake, these markets are massive. Etsy estimates its total online addressable market is $437 billion. Factoring in offline retail channels, Etsy is swimming in a $2 trillionglobal marketfor one-of-a-kind goods. The company recorded $10 billion in gross merchandise sales last year -- just 1% of this opportunity. Even if Etsy experiences double-digit growth over the next decade, it will still only capture a small slice of its market.
To fire up growth, Etsy can expand its customer base in the U.S. and international markets. It can enter new markets either organically or through acquisitions, as seen with last month's deal to buy Elo7 -- what it calls the ""Etsy of Brazil."" Complementing organic growth with strategic acquisitions is a smart move by management. For one, the company has a strong balance sheet to back up these deals. As it grows the profitability of its existing business, Etsy will likely continue generating significant amounts of cash flow, which it can reinvest in these younger, but fast-growing ventures.
Moreover, Etsy is in good hands. CEO Josh Silverman has decades of experience growing technology and e-commerce companies, such as Skype and eBay's shopping.com. Silverman's leadership will prove handy as Etsy enters its next phase of growth.
Is Etsy a buy now?
By now, it's not hard to see why Etsy has an exciting future. With its unique marketplace offering, Etsy has managed to carve out a valuable niche for itself. And moving forward, Etsy has massive growth opportunities -- and the balance sheet to back it up.
Etsy's incredible rally reflects this positive outlook. The stock has gained a monstrous 1,890% since July 2016 and is up 80% over the past 12 months.
While I like Etsy as a company, I believe the stock's recent run-up -- while justified -- also makes it too hot to handle. So I'll be watchlisting Etsy first while waiting for a better entry point -- such as the next market correction.

July 28 (Reuters) - Shares of PayPal Holdings IncPYPL.O fell 8% on the payment company's downbeat current-quarter profit outlook that outweighed a better-than-expected profit in the second quarter from a pandemic-driven shift to digital spending.
EBay Inc's EBAY.O continued transition to its own managed payments platform instead of using PayPal for its e-commerce platform served a blow to the latter's performance view for the remainder of 2021.
PayPal has been among the big winners of the COVID-19 pandemic as more people used its services to shop online and pay bills to avoid stepping out. Businesses, forced to move their stores online, also flocked to PayPal.
This helped the company process a total of $311 billion in payments in the second quarter ended June 30, up 40% from a year earlier, and added 11.4 million net new active accounts.
Total revenue in the second quarter rose 19% to $6.24 billion, but missed estimates of $6.27 billion, according to Refinitiv data, further hurting shares.
PayPal said it expects third-quarter net revenue to be in the range of about $6.15 billion to $6.25 billion, representing growth of about 13%-14% at current spot rates, but missing analysts' average estimate of $6.45 billion.
San Jose, California-based PayPal also said it expects adjusted profit of $1.07 per share, in-line with a year earlier, but lower than estimates of $1.14.
It expects annual total payment volumes to rise between 33% and 35% on a spot and forex neutral basis.
On an adjusted basis, PayPal earned a profit of $1.15 per share in the second quarter, compared with analysts' expectations of $1.12 per share, according to Refinitiv data.
Venmo, PayPal's app that allows individuals in the United States to send and receive money, processed $58 billion in payments, up 58% from a year earlier.

In other cases, fintechs are just competing for space in burgeoning areas of the economy and struggling to become profitable. In other words, fintechs come in all stripes, shapes, and flavors.
But if you are looking for a safe, established fintech with a history of massive growth and the potential for continued dominance, look no further than PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ: PYPL).

A dominant force in a growing industry
""Safe"" is a relative term, as no company is truly exempt from the possibility of a negative performance. But among fintech growth stocks, few are safer bets than PayPal. Established in 1998, it could be considered the granddaddy of the digital payments industry. As of March 31, it had more than 392 million active users and a long history as an earnings machine.
PayPal checks off all the boxes you should be looking at when determining a safe fintech. For starters, it has a history of consistent revenue and earnings growth. Over the past five years, its earnings have grown at an annualized rate of 31% and revenue has increased by about 19% per year. On top of that, it is highly efficient, with a 23% profit margin and a 29% return on equity. At the end of the first quarter, it had $19.1 billion in cash and cash equivalents, with $8.9 billion in debt. Further, it grew its free cash flow 27% to $1.5 billion. All of that leaves it well equipped to weather difficult periods and invest in growth.
The company is coming off its best quarter ever, as revenue in Q1 jumped 30% to $6 billion, thanks to a 50% increase in total payment volume (TPV) on its platforms. Mobile payments app Venmo accounted for $51 billion of the $285 billion in TPV -- a 63% year-over-year increase. In all, it added 14.5 million net new accounts in the quarter. As the market leader in the digital payments industry, PayPal has been lifted by the ongoing shift to digital payments, a trend accelerated last year by the pandemic.
In addition, it is the market leader in online payments with a huge network of users -- 392 million at last count -- and brands that are synonymous with their functions. That gives it a huge competitive edge and makes it difficult for rivals to gain market share. Combined, these factors all contribute to PayPal's strength and stability.
The future is bright
Since it spun off from eBay in 2015, PayPal's stock has posted an average annualized return of about 41%. But there are a few key reasons why PayPal should be able to continue to grow for years.
First off, it's the market leader in an industry that is expected to experience huge growth over the next decade. According to a recent report from PricewaterhouseCoopers, the volume of digital payments worldwide is expected to grow by 80% by 2025 and triple by 2030.
Also, PayPal has been busy expanding its capabilities to meet the evolving needs of this market, first through Venmo, one of the leaders in mobile payments, along with Square's Cash App. Also, PayPal has come out with a Venmo credit card with Visa, and it's now allowing customers to buy, hold, and sell cryptocurrencies on Venmo.
In addition, it rolled out QR code payment capabilities for both PayPal and Venmo for in-store purchases. On the first-quarter earnings call in May, CEO Dan Schulman said more than 1 million merchants were already using it. And more innovations are coming: Schulman said that the company plans to introduce its ""next-generation digital wallet"" in the third quarter.
Its most recent move was to launch Zettle, a digital point-of-sale platform that allows small businesses to accept payments, both in person and online. The platform also has tools that allow retailers to manage sales, inventory, reporting, and payments. It's targeted to compete with Square's suite of products for merchants.
These initiatives will all serve to expand PayPal's addressable market in the years to come, which means it should have a lot more room to grow in what is expected to be a booming industry. With its earnings power, financial stability, and brand recognition, it should maintain a competitive advantage and be a safe bet for stellar long-term growth.

2021-07-24 00:00:00+00:00,Will Square Be Worth More Than PayPal by 2025?,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/will-square-be-worth-more-than-paypal-by-2025-2021-07-24,,,"Square (NYSE: SQ) and PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL) have both generated massive returns for patient investors over the past few years. Square went public at $9 per share in late 2015, and it's now trading at around $260. PayPal, which was spun off from eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY) earlier that year, has advanced more than 720% since its debut to over $300 per share.
Square is worth nearly $120 billion as of this writing, while PayPal is worth over $350 billion. That isn't surprising, since PayPal still serves a much larger audience and operates in more countries than Square. But gazing into the future, could Square eventually match -- or even surpass -- PayPal's valuation by 2025? Let's examine both fintech companies' growth trajectories and valuations to find out.
Image source: Getty Images.
Wild ambitions vs. stable growth
Square and PayPal's core business models are similar. Both companies charge businesses flat fees, which vary by platform and transaction type, to process payments. Both companies offer small business loans. Square's Cash App and PayPal's Venmo both enable consumers to make peer-to-peer payments, and both companies provide branded debit cards that are linked to users' online accounts.
But Square has been willing to take bolder risks than PayPal over the past few years. It expanded its services ecosystem with online payroll management services and analytics tools, and recently launched a full suite of online banking services. Square also added Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) purchases to its Cash App in 2018, added free stock trades to the app to challenge Robinhood in 2019, and plans to add Credit Karma's tax filing services to its ecosystem in the near future.
PayPal only started offering cryptocurrency trades last October, and it doesn't have any near-term plans to launch stock trading tools or dedicated tax filing services, or expand into a full-blown online bank like Square. Simply put, Square seems to have wilder and grander ambitions than PayPal.
Which company is growing faster?
Between 2015 and 2020, Square grew its annual revenue at a CAGR of 49.6%. Excluding its massive gain in Bitcoin revenue last year, it would still have grown its revenue at a CAGR of 31.2% over the past five years. PayPal's annual revenue grew at a CAGR of 18.5% between 2015 and 2020. Let's take a look at Wall Street's expectations for both companies over the next two years.
COMPANY
ESTIMATED SALES GROWTH
(FY 2021)
ESTIMATED SALES GROWTH
(FY 2022)
Square
110.6%
14.1%
PayPal
20.6%
21.5%
Source: Yahoo Finance, July 22.
Analysts expect Square's Bitcoin revenue to continue rising this year before cooling off next year. They also expect its growth in transaction-based and seller service revenue, which slowed down during the pandemic, to recover as more businesses reopen. The Cash App, which grew its monthly active users 50% to 36 million in 2020, should also keep expanding as Square adds new services.
Cathie Wood's ARK Invest expects Square's transaction-based and seller service revenues to grow at a CAGR of 19% through 2025. It also expects the Cash App's MAUs to more than double to 75 million, for Square to monetize roughly 40% of those users, and for its average revenue per Cash App user to grow from $25 in 2019 to $260 in 2025 -- which would represent a whopping CAGR of 49%.
PayPal's growth should remain more predictable, since it doesn't generate significant revenue from cryptocurrencies yet. Instead, it will mainly rely on its growth in active accounts, which rose 21% year-over-year to 392 million last quarter, to generate stable revenue from its processing fees.
PayPal expects to nearly double its active accounts to 750 million and more than double its annual revenue to over $50 billion by 2025. It also plans to grow its earnings at a CAGR of 22% from 2020 to 2025. It believes the rising acceptance of QR codes and NFC payments, the expansion of its financial services, and higher engagement rates for its apps will all drive that long-term growth.
Will Square be worth more than PayPal by 2025?
In a best-case scenario, ARK Invest believes Square's stock could hit $500 per share by 2025 if it hits its growth targets. But unlike PayPal, Square hasn't provided any concrete targets of its own yet.
If Square hits $500 and its valuations hold steady, it could be worth just over $200 billion by 2025. Meanwhile, if PayPal achieves its goals of more than doubling its annual revenue and growing its EPS at a CAGR of 22% through 2025, its stock could easily double and boost its market cap to $700 billion.
Therefore, it's doubtful that Square -- which already trades at higher valuations than PayPal -- will be the more valuable company by 2025. But that doesn't mean PayPal is necessarily a better growth stock than Square. I personally own Square instead of PayPal, because I admire its ambitious and forward-thinking strategies. Both stocks are still great long-term investments on the booming fintech market, so investors shouldn't fret too much over which company has the higher market cap.

The stock is up over 36% year to date as investors are enthused about the company's prospects even in the aftermath of the pandemic.
The company saw an increase in activity during lockdowns that is sustaining through economic reopenings. Users who recently signed up for the first time are liking the platform and deciding it is a nice choice to have. Here are three reasons why eBay stock is a nice choice for investors.
Image source: Getty Images.
1. Never sold out
Supply chain issues have been plaguing businesses since the onset of the pandemic. Consumers changed their behavior on a dime, and manufacturers had little time to adjust. As a result, you had a situation where items like game consoles, home-office desks, and toilet paper were often sold out at local retail stores. Meanwhile, you had an abundance of items in categories that few people wanted, like tuxedos, business attire, and breath mints.
That highlighted eBay's asset-light business model. The company did not face any supply shortages or overages, because it doesn't carry an inventory of its own. When next-gen gaming consoles were sold out at Walmart and Target, eBay sellers had whatever you needed. Sure, you may pay higher than retail price, but the product was available.
Moreover, the concentration of consumer spending is also creating bottlenecks in shipping the items. Again, since eBay does not operate fulfillment facilities, leaving shipments and returns to buyers and sellers, it is not troubled with shipping constraints or elevated shipping and handling expenses.
There is no telling how long these supply issues will last. Every quarter it goes on, eBay gains more interest from consumers where it operates.
2. Advertising revenue growth
eBay's active buyer growth during the pandemic was not remarkable. From the fourth quarter of 2019 to the first quarter of 2021, eBay added 13 million active buyers. But what matters more here is the level of activity, not the growing number of buyers. eBay reached a total of 187 million active buyers. That's a large group of folks with a payment method on file, ready to bid on an item or buy an item outright.
And where you have ready and willing buyers, you usually have businesses ready to advertise to them, trying to convince them that their product is the one they should buy. Indeed, eBay generated $1 billion in ad revenue in 2020. And already in the first quarter of 2021, ad revenue was $224 million, up 58% from the same quarter in the previous year. Here's what management had to say on expanding this opportunity:
We reached $1 billion of advertising revenue in 2020 primarily through Promoted Listings, which leverages a risk-free CPA (cost per acquisition) model for fixed-price inventory. To capture our next billion, we are running multiple experiments, including an ad product for auctions and cost-per-click capabilities. We are also exploring a new capability that expands seller exposure by increasing off eBay traffic to Promoted Listings.

3. A robust share buyback program
Finally, eBay has announced its intention to buy back $5 billion worth of its own shares in 2021. That equates to roughly 10% of the company's $46 billion market cap. With the program in place, investors can be less fearful of a large drop in its share price. If such a drop was to happen, eBay could step in and buy up large chunks of its shares, lifting the price back up and reducing its overall share count.
The massive buyback program also signals to the market that management believes eBay's stock is undervalued. That can go a long way in lifting investor sentiment. Still, there is a risk that buying in now would be inefficient -- buying at high prices when all this good news is already priced into the stock, which is already up over 36% year to date.
Investors can split their purchase allocation into several tranches and conduct their purchases over several months to alleviate those concerns. That way, if there is a crash in the share price, part of your purchases will be at a lower price and therefore lower your overall cost basis.

David Gardner: 30 separate times, about every 10 weeks on this podcast, over six years, I picked five stocks. I chose a theme that made sense to me at the time, sometimes sublime, sometimes silly, and then I thought to myself, what are the five best recommendations I can come up with for stocks that fit my theme, aiming to beat the market. Of course, always to beat the market, the S&P 500, otherwise why are we bothering? Then one year later we review the picks. What was the theme again? How are the stocks done and also versus the market? More important for our learning, why is our way of thinking, have the stocks done what they've done? A one year review, and then another year passes the two-year review and then we never forget. We hope you wouldn't also, we score everything transparently and accountably, because we're Fools. You should expect that of us, then the three-year review, which is often the most telling. First, because three years have passed since I picked the five stocks, so we really can be smarter about what has happened and why, and what we can learn smarter. If I've done my job well then we'll also be happier and richer as well. Second, that three-year review is telling because most of the time we end the game right there. We'll keep holding those stocks, mind and you should too, if you own them. But if I kept reviewing all 30 of my samplers in years four, five, six etc. We wouldn't have time to do much else on this podcast. 30 separate times I have picked five stocks, what I've always called my five-stock samplers, and we're going to review three of those samplers today. Five Stocks For America, Five Stocks That Pass The Snap Test, and Five Stocks For The 2018 World Cup. Review them we will with my three analysts guest stars, Alicia Alfiere, Yasser El-Shimy, and Sanmeet Deo, only on this week's Rule Breaker Investing.
[...]
Gardner: Welcome back to Rule Breaker Investing. Hey, it's summer. Thanks for taking the time to listen. A lot of people are at the beach or if you're an American, I hope you had a great time celebrating our nation's independence over this past weekend, but darn it, if you're here listening to me, that means you are committed, you are true-blue Rule Breaker. Thank you for joining me. I hope not just this week but all month because we've got some excitement, in fact I'm going to hype it up here. Why not? Let's do it. It's my show, I can do whatever I want. I'm going to hype it up and mention it to you, next week's show. Because I'm going to welcome for the first-time an external guest and use the Telling Their Stories format, which I hope a lot of you have gotten to know as we've done it several times this year. But rather than ask one of my fellow Fool employees to tell his or her story, I'm going to ask a longtime Fool member to tell his story next week. The reason, for some of you anyway, this will be particularly compelling is because this is a present day National Football League head coach who also happens to have been for the past 10 years or so, a Motley Fool member and a very avid investor himself. I'm really excited. I'm not going to mention which of the 32 NFL teams this gentleman is the head coach of, but rest assured, he has a great story and I'm excited for this man to tell his story on next week's show. That will be next week, but let's peel it back here to the here and now.
This week, we get to do what we've often called a review-a-palooza podcast. This is going to be a review, not just of one past five-stock sampler, but three different ones, and as I mentioned at the top, they are Five Stocks For America, Five Stocks That Passed The Snap Test, and Five Stocks For The 2018 World Cup. For each of them, I'm delighted to be joined by a Motley Fool analyst and in fact, a number of new voices. Some Rule Breaker Investing podcasts debuts are in store this week. I'm really looking forward to either reintroducing you or introducing you to my friends Alicia, Yasser, and Sanmeet, and we're going to talk through these samplers and without further ado, I say, let's get started. First up, as we usually do with these review-a-paloozas, I'm going to go with the most recent one first, so it was one year ago. In fact, the date was June 10th of 2020, Five Stocks For America. I'll say a little bit more about that in a sec, but first let me welcome Alicia Alfiere. Alicia a delight to have you back to Rule Breaker Investing.
Alicia Alfiere: Thank you, I'm so glad to be here.
Gardner: Thanks a lot for putting in some time over a busy weekend, no doubt. [laughs] I hope you were still able to enjoy the festivities. I know you spent most of your weekend, no doubt, looking over these five stocks and unearthing your best insight around them but thank you for that.
Alfiere: Of course, and it was the perfect stock sampler to be thinking about over the 4th of July weekend since it is the sampler for America.
Gardner: It is very true, and we'll talk about the stocks in a sec. But before we do Alicia, how about one, two minutes, just a little of where you come from before you were at The Motley Fool, and how are you spending your time so far in your first year or so at The Fool?
Alfiere: Sure, of course. I first discovered the joys of investing when I was in high school. A high school Math teacher came into the room one day and told us, money doesn't grow on trees, but you can grow money, and I [laughs] loved this concept. I was hooked on investing and might have annoyed my dad about it a little too much. I spent a lot of time in the airline industry actually on the labor side, and then I was lucky enough to have an opening at The Fool. I thought to myself why not go back to that original passion that I have of finding compelling companies, researching companies and investing.
Gardner: Wonderful. Alicia, I know in particular you've focused on the airline industry for understandable reasons given your background, but we don't actually have you spending much time with airlines stocks, do we?
Alfiere: No, no. Right now I'm working with Rule Breakers as well as The Ownership Portfolio and I do some work for Stock Advisor as well.
Gardner: Wonderful. It's a reminder that truly, we're probably more a company of generalists rather than specialists. We certainly have some amazing specialists at The Fool. But I think you're going to hear in each of my fellow Fool stories today as you get to know them a little bit through these samplers, that they're really coming from all different walks of life. They weren't raised by a father or mother who said stock market, and you must be an analyst one day at The Motley Fool. I think most of us had no idea, including me in our early 20s, where the heck we'd be working or that we'd be here today. Anyway Alicia, thank you very much and welcome. Five Stocks For America was picked June 10th of last year, and at the time I was thinking about it coming up on independence day back then. But I was also thinking about how our nation was hurting. A lot of the publicity around America was that we have done a very poor job with coronavirus. The numbers we're starting to spike again. We all hoped that we could get out a little bit in the summer, and then of course the fall came back and got worse. But America looked behind. I'm really actually in a way happy to say, Alicia, that I feel as if a year later we've done a pretty good job as a nation, getting vaccines in the first place, which we didn't have a year ago this month. But when actually getting vaccinated, I feel like we're almost the vanguard of the world now in terms of having done it, as well as anybody else I think at this point. There's a little bit of a patriotic note as we start July of 2021. Any thoughts back on that before we hit the stocks?
Alfiere: Yeah, I agree. I was just going to say, I'm so excited to see the economy continue to reopen and have people continue to go back to their lives. It's going to be amazing.
Gardner: Thank you very much. Well said, and I agree and we're feeling it today. Speaking of feeling at the market, I have been feeling it since June 10th of last year. Now, every one of our stocks we compare against the market averages, and the market is up 35.4% since this sampler debuted a year or so ago. That is the bogey, that is what we're trying to hit or beat, is to beat the market average, and that's a pretty great year, Alicia. Not every year does the S&P 500 go up about 35% or so, but that's what happened over the last year. Let's start as we traditionally do with the worst performer. The ticker symbol is ZNGA, this is the mobile entertainment software company. Zynga (NASDAQ: ZNGA), certainly a stock that I have favorite pick for Stock Advisor a couple of different times. It's done OK, it's up 19.4%. But when the market's up 35.4%, that means we start -16% in the whole. What do you see when you look at Zynga, Alicia?
Alfiere: When you first talked about Zynga last year, you mentioned the core value of resilience, and they're still resilient though maybe this cake takes a little longer to bake, or outperformed the S&P. What I really want to highlight here for Zynga is a single word, acquisition. There are two sides to the acquisition coin. One side is that cost from acquisition causes Zynga to report net losses in 2020. The other side is that these acquisitions really helped to fuel growth, and we saw this with growth and revenues, with their highest ever revenue for a quarter in the first quarter of 2021. Pretty impressive, they had impressive growth and active users. Some of this was driven by the new games from the acquisitions of Rollic, which added hyper casual games to Zynga's portfolio, which are easy to play and expected to be one of the fastest-growing segments for Zynga.
Gardner: Hyper casual as a lifetime game, where I [laughs] have to admit myself, I've never actually heard that phrase. I'm glad that they're making acquisitions in that area. Thank you by the way, Alicia, for reminding me that for each of the five stocks that I picked, I was tagging it to what I consider to be one of America's five core values. Which just for the fun of it, I think of, this is just my own take as liberty, justice, enterprise, resilience, and kindness. This fourth stock, Zynga was the resilient company, and indeed it has been a very resilient company since its IPO, which was very hot and then troubled some years later, changing over management, etc. Still a young company but pretty resilient. It is up about 19%, which most years I'll take for most stocks. If we could do that every year with every stock, we'd be awfully happy 10 or 100 years later. But as it turns out, this is an underperformer, 16%. Let's swing now from Zynga, which was my resilient stock to the best performer, and that happens to have been the enterprise stock, and that's Etsy (NASDAQ: ETSY), ticker symbol ETSY, which is also the name of the company. On June 10th of 2020, Etsy closed at $79.81. I'm really happy to say, it's just over $196 today, so this stock is up about 146%. That's way ahead of the S&P's 35.4% gain. Alicia, have you bought anything yourself on Etsy in the last year and helped out the cost?
Alfiere: Oh my gosh, so much, I'm actually one of their habitual, which is the most frequent class of buyers.
Gardner: That's wonderful. I have to admit, I've used Etsy once or twice. I pick the stock more than I've used it. I deeply admire the company, I love what it does for suppliers, and for buyers. You are classed as a buyer here like frequent buyer club or silver level or something.
Alfiere: No, I just know that based on looking at their earnings and what they deem to be a frequent buyer.
Gardner: Yes. Tell us a little bit more.
Alfiere: Yeah, definitely. Etsy is the e-commerce platform for the unique, handmade, and vintage, and it's a powerhouse brand. If we were to look back at their performance over last year, you'd be forgiven if you thought masks were the main reason behind Etsy's rise since they did make up about 4% of the marketplace's gross merchandise sales in 2020. But there's so much more to Etsy than masks like their massive growth. Etsy outpaced e-commerce growth by more than 2.5 times in 2020. This massive growth is driven by their growing network of buyers and those that had high-frequency for purchases like me. Active buyers increased almost 90% year-over-year and even more impressive is the growth in habitual buyers like me, which is up 205% year-over-year, so pretty impressive growth here.
Gardner: What I've always loved about this business is I've described it as Amazon-proof for a long period of time. What I love about Amazon is you could buy almost anything there. But almost anything you bought on Amazon which I celebrate, you could buy other places too. A lot of the things that you buy on Etsy, you really can only find on Etsy, and that even includes the very niche world of geeky board gamers like me. Because a lot of people bling-out components or make better storage for the box, like you bought the board game but the components don't fit that well back into the box, and so people create all kinds of solutions. Again, within this very niche world of board games. That's an example of Etsy's relevance and you really can only find those things on Etsy, which is what I love about Etsy too. That goes for me as the investor, delighted to know that this has been a long standing Rule Breakers stock. In fact, we first brought it to Rule Breakers, the month was, wow, it wasn't even that long ago, November 2016. The stock was at 13 that day so seeing it around 196, makes me and a lot of Rule Breaker members pretty happy. Less than five years later, to see the stock a 14-bagger and counting, a company still with a $25 billion market cap, Alicia, seems like it has some room to run.
Alfiere: Oh, definitely and in fact there's so much more growth to come. They've recently purchased Depop, which is going to allow them to expand their network size, increase their reach within Generation-Z, and expand their footprint within the resale fashion industry, so very exciting stuff.
Gardner: That's great, so that's been the best performer. Now, let's just briefly cover anything you'd like to say about the other three somewhere in the middle and to state them and their performances really quickly. Worst to first in the middle three, Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX), the worst of the middle three, up 46%, that's good. Axon Enterprise (NASDAQ: AXON), up 70%, that's even better, again, against the market's 35% gain doubling the market. Then the second best performer in this group of five, The Boston Beer Company (NYSE: SAM), which of course I made my liberty stock, the liberty core value freedom thinking of Sam Adams, up 78%. I just threw three completely different businesses at you there, Alicia. Starbucks, Axon Enterprise, which by the way, I picked a couple of weeks ago in my 30th five-Stock Sampler. This is one of those I go back to from time-to-time. Starbucks, Axon Enterprise, and The Boston Beer Company, what do you got for us on any of those?
Alfiere: Yeah, definitely. Let's try to do a lightning round here. For Starbucks, I would say, the original third place did struggle a bit last year with declines in revenue and profitability due to COVID and closures. Actually, they were a bit behind the S&P until around September and their turnaround was a result of the company's adjusting and adapting to consumer trends during COVID. They saw that transactions were moving from city center to the suburbs, from cafes to drive-throughs, and they took action by rolling out curbside pickup, expanding drive-through presence, and making improvements to their mobile app.
Gardner: I remember how low morale felt, not just at Starbucks, but around our country, last June. There are a lot of Starbucks' that were closed or trying and struggling to reopen. To think that the stock has actually up 46% from a year-ago, talk about resilience. Although, I made this, of course, my kindness company. I really do think that kindness is one of America's five core values. I never want us to forget that. For me anyway, Starbucks is going to put some of its baristas through college, that is a place where you can meet a friend and has been for a long time a brand that equally attracts females and males. There's so many things that I appreciate about Starbucks, including the many hours and many dollars spent myself. I've done a little bit more business with Starbucks than Etsy, I don't know about you Alicia.
Alfiere: Same.
Gardner: Okay, good. Great recounting of Starbucks. What would you like to say about Axon Enterprise?
Alfiere: Back in the original sampling, you mentioned Axon as the core value of justice and I agree. I want to modify that a bit to be transparent justice. Because of the growing need for transparency and public safety and transformation and policing is what has really driven the demand for Axon products here.
Gardner: Well said. Again, because we've talked about this quite a lot in the last few weeks, let's move onto the final one. Because if you'd like to learn more about Axon Enterprise and that I picked it for my 30th five-stock sampler just a couple of weeks ago, please go back dear listener and listen again. The last one then, The Boston Beer Company, I understand people were drinking alcohol over the last year, is that accurate?
Alfiere: It is. Boston Beer, I really think they should maybe think about rebranding to Boston Beer and seltzer. Because here's the thing, the growth wasn't from beer, it was all from those hard seltzers you've been seeing in grocery stores and Target.
Gardner: Which really says a lot to me. I think they're healthier because there's less sugar, at least, in them. But really what I mean to say is it says a lot to me about the company's ability to adapt and evolve. We have seen not just Boston Beer, but many brands, all of a sudden with their new brands that have their hard seltzer brands. It's been a big and growing market so I'm always glad to know management doesn't have it's head in the sand.
Alfiere: Agreed, and it's always good to see these flexible, adaptable companies.
Gardner: Thank you. Well, Alicia, a beautiful job just looking over these five companies which performed beautifully and let's just go ahead and summarize. The market rose 35.4% on average. Well, these five stocks went from 146% gain for Etsy down to the 19% gain for Zynga. These five stocks have averaged 71.8%, which means we're ahead 36.4% per stock, just about a year later. It's been a spectacular year for America, I'm going to say that and for Five Stocks for America as well. Now a reminder, like most of these games we play it for three years, so we're not going to pound our chest or celebrate too early or too loudly because a lot can happen over the next couple of years, but at least for the first year of Five Stocks for America, Alicia, does this get a passing grade from you?
Alfiere: I think so, definitely passing and I can't wait to see what they do in the future.
Gardner: Thank you. I agree. They literally have just about doubled up on the market again. The market is up 35.4%, my school boy math tells me if you double 35.4%, that's 70.8%. These stocks averaged 71.8% so it's really been a great year for these five stocks. Alicia, I hope it's been a great year for you, your first year or so at the Motley Fool and we're looking forward to working together and seeing you in Rule Breakers in the year ahead.
Alfiere: Thanks, and it has been wonderful. I'm so glad to be here.
Gardner: All right. Well, from Five Stocks for America from June of 2020, we go back one year in the calendar and let's go with the way back music machine. Please, Rick Engdahl.
We've settled now on June 5th of 2019 and the five-stock sampler from June 2019 was entitled Five Stocks That Pass The Snap Test. Now, my next friend and I will discuss what we mean by the snap test in a second, but let me first welcome Yasser El-Shimy. Yasser, I'm delighted to have you on Rule Breaker Investing.
Yasser El-Shimy: Always happy to be here, David.
Gardner: Is this your debut on this podcast, Yasser? You and I have worked together. We actually haven't seen each other in our offices yet, but you've been at the Fool for, I'm going to say the better part of a year now. But is this your debut on Rule Breaker Investing?
El-Shimy: This is my first appearance on Rule Breaker Investing and I'm happy to be here. I have to say I've been a longtime listener of the show and of the podcast. I've learned a great deal, and as you well know, David, it has persuaded me, convinced me, maybe help me see, if there's, any that maybe I should change what I was doing for a living and do something that is actually a little closer to my heart and which I'm hoping also I'm good at.
Gardner: Yes, and you are. Because you're somebody who picks up things and you're good at them, Yasser, that's what I've learned about you and you certainly have been a fast study. I would love for you briefly in a minute or two to give a little bit of a back story. Where did you come from before you got to The Motley Fool?
El-Shimy: Oh, well, it's a very long story, but I'll try and just reduce it to two minutes here. I started back in Cairo, Egypt, born and raised. I immigrated to the U.S. around 2007 where I started an academic program doing a PhD in Political Science and had a brief career in academia as well as dabbling into the policy world and working on foreign policy issues here in DC think tanks for a number of years until I decided that this was not really for me. What I really cared about was investing and in particular stock-picking, owning individual companies has completely changed my life for the better. That is a mission that I will take with me to my grave, if you will, hopefully helping people become richer, happier, and smarter as they come to learn more about the potential of picking long-term winners that can create wealth against all odds and really helping change people's lives for the better.
Gardner: Thank you very much for that, Yasser. I do want to mention that I first got to know you because you, as a graduate student in business school, that career change you mentioned had you all of a sudden at Georgetown University Business school in the executive MBA program, I believe, but I was meeting you through conscious capitalism events around the greater DC area as we started our chapter so I appreciate that you have a heart for that and knowledge about that and that's your perspective as well. Perhaps as we go through these five stocks, Yasser, we might recognize one that might be a conscious capitalism company, although that was not the theme. The theme was Five Stocks That Pass The Snap Test. Would you briefly summarize the snap tests for our listeners?
El-Shimy: The snap test is where you have companies, if you were to snap your fingers and they go absent, this absence will be felt and possibly mourned in my opinion. We want to make sure that those companies are companies that leave a mark, if you will, that they have a strong presence in our society and in our lives, and if they were to disappear, that absence would really be felt.
Gardner: That is very well stated and that is indeed the snap tests. I think I first wrote about it in the Rule Breakers, Rule Makers book in the late 1990s. I've used it for years. I think it guides all of us. If you snapped your fingers and that company disappeared, I love that word mourned, not just noticed, but if it comes to truly be mourned by those, not just the employees who just lost their job overnight, but how about all of the customers, most of all, all of the stakeholders. We're going to do better as investors if we are guided by snap test thinking as we think about what's our next pick. Five Stocks That Pass The Snap Test. Well, obviously for me anyway, and this is an individual decision, for me, these five companies, at least back in June of 2019, felt like that kind of a company. Before we talk about the worst performer, which is how we start these, let's go over how the market has done since June 5th of 2019. The market is up 52.7%. Wow, that is a spectacular two-year performance just for the market averages. Let's hope we can beat that with Five Stocks That Pass The Snap Test. But let's be clear right now, that is a high bar over which to leap with any stock picks because there are not as many two-year periods where you see the S&P 500 get more than 50%, but this happens to be one of them. With that said Yasser, let's start with the worst performer. The ticker symbol is LYV, the company is Live Nation (NYSE: LYV). Boy, you talked about a business that got shutdown by coronavirus. Live Nation has been deeply affected. Yasser, can you remind us what Live Nation does and what is your take on the stocks movement over the last couple of years?
El-Shimy: First of all, I want to say that the return on S&P 500 over the past two years is a very high bar to clear and we should not expect those returns to continue in perpetuity, if you will. But having said that, the bar for this sampler has been fairly high, and even so, Live Nation has fallen just below the bar not very much. What is Live Nation? Live Nation is a company that works in the events bookings space. If you want to go to a concert, you want to have an event, you can either organize it or you can purchase the tickets through Live Nation or through Ticketmaster.com, which is also owned by the company. This company has definitely suffered as you said, David, due to COVID. I'm glad to say that Live Nation as a company has not really done poorly through management decisions, bad acquisitions, or anything as such, it was really the victim of an external exogenous shock to the system, something nobody anticipated COVID-19, a highly contagious life threatening virus spread throughout the world like wildfire. We have had lockdowns, mask and social distancing mandates, and people basically just started avoiding congregations of any kind. If you're in the business of getting people together in one indoor location, your business is really bound to suffer as a result.
Gardner: That is very true. The stock, which I picked at $61.95 back in June of 2019, moved up to around $70. Then, as coronavirus hit and it became evident in March of 2020 last year, that this was for real, Live Nation dropped basically from $70 to $20 in just a matter of a few months. To think that it's now back over $84 as we speak, I see it at $84.87 basically up 37% during two years where well for about one of those years, it was barely doing business. That is, talk about resilience, a remarkable performance. Certainly the company seems well-positioned to me, Yasser. As things open up, I think a lot of people want to go back to venues and buy tickets. Sometimes I feel like I have to pay Ticketmaster a little bit more for that service fee than I should expect. There are aspects where I don't even quite love this company, but at the same time, I'm very persuaded that if you snap your fingers and overnight things like Ticketmaster and some of the venues that Live Nation owns and some of the acts that it works with, if those disappeared, there would be mourning.
El-Shimy: You're absolutely right, David. We're talking about the previous two years here. We have seen revenues for Live Nation decline from around $11.5 billion in 2019 to $1.8 billion in 2020. That's down almost 84%. They basically made as much in all of 2020 as they would have done in a month plus in 2019. The fact that they have survived 2020 and now coming back strong is really a testament to the resilience of the business and to the demand for the product. However, as we move forward, I know there's a lot of optimism for, what Wall Street calls, the reopening trade. We have to keep in mind a couple of counter trends that might also put a lid on just how successful Live Nation could be moving forward. One of those is that we were talking about, the thesis for Live Nation for so long is that the millennial generation, younger people in general, prefer experiences over buying stuff. Well now, thanks to COVID, people have become, especially younger people and millennials, much more likely to form households, to buy houses, or they have to pay that mortgage, they have to pay those auto loans. There are a lot of things that are now competing for their dollars, not just experiences anymore. The other counter trend is that you have some heavy hitters like Zoom, like Roblox, which are trying to offer virtual concerts, virtual events, that will become a compelling alternative to live attendance. Therefore, I think this is one I'm going to watch definitely to see how they're going to do over the next year or two.
Gardner: Very well said. Those are important insights. I appreciate that because while we spend a lot of time with the sample like this looking backward, Yasser, you're helping us think forward about this company and really the culture that it's tied to. Thank you for those insights. Well, that was the worst performer for these five stocks. Now, we always get to move from worst to best. The best performer, well this will be a company that should be already very familiar to my listeners this week because indeed Axon Enterprise, ticker symbol AXON, is the best performer for five stocks that passed the snap test, well, through its first two years anyway. We just talked about it with Alicia. My golly, I just picked it a couple of weeks ago for Five Stocks Pursued By The Bear. There must be something about June, it's not like I pick Axon that often, but for some reason June samplers, apparently I love this company. Happy to say, Yasser that we picked it at $68 a share even on June 5th of 2019. These days it's closer to $175, so the stock is up about 157% against the market's 52.7%. This is beating the market by more than 100% in these two years. I realize Alicia covered this a little bit, but what have you unearthed or what do you think about Axon Enterprise today, Yasser?
El-Shimy: Sure. Let me first say congratulations on a very good call on Axon, when you did pick it. This company has returned an impressive 26% revenue CAGR over the past five years. CloudUnit, which has higher gross margins, has grown at double that rate. Those are very impressive statistics. What I do appreciate personally about this company, and you spoke earlier about my attendance of conscious capitalism events around DC, is that this is a very ESG focused company. This is a company that cares about stakeholders, but also has a very noble mission of protecting lives. Our society does have a critical need for more transparency in our law enforcement as well as the, perhaps, use of non-lethal means to deescalate certain situations. This company is really delivering, it's really meeting that need in very impressive ways. I'd also like to add here that Axon Enterprise has proven to be a very agile business. When you have a company like TASER International, that's the old name for the company, they were making a pretty good product, they were selling. There was nothing wrong with the business, yet they decided to go way beyond that. They have evolved as a company to fill every possible need. From smart devices to workflow management, to evidence and data management, and intelligent software. They have continued to innovate. They've continued to create that flywheel effect, if you will, where they are able to integrate the hardware with the software and really create a compelling value proposition for law enforcement and other entities around the country and beyond.
Gardner: Well said. [...] Anybody who heard last week's mailbag knows the scuttlebutt out there that this company may not just be thinking about law enforcement, perhaps management is thinking bigger, starting to look at adjacent industries where, as you said Yasser, more transparency could be helpful. The example from last week was the mining industry, which should be, I don't know if it's as big as law enforcement, but certainly a whole new industry for this company to take its products. A really interesting, compelling situation. Glad we were compelled by it two years ago, but it's just as compelling today. Optionality being very evident in this company's management and its approach, starting with the TASER moving to law enforcement cameras. Boy, I love what you said about transparency. This is a very American week for those of us here in the United States of America celebrating our independence. I like to think that we are among the most transparent economies and nations in the world. I still think we have a lot of improvement we can do in that regard. Boy, what I love is to take that overseas and abroad. I would love to see as much transparency across all societies as possible. I'm not talking about Big Brother transparency, often Big Brother obfuscates. I'm talking about open air transactions and being evident, being trustworthy because at the heart of transparency is trust building. I really like that Axon Enterprise has imbued that and so many of the law enforcement agencies which by the way, have needed it and a lot of people have called for it. Here we are with a for-profit answer that I think is pretty well-positioned.
Anyway, a little bit of a patriotic comment here in this week of patriotism for the United States of America. Well, Yasser, thank you. We've covered Live Nation, the worst performer, and Axon Enterprise, the best. Mathematically oriented listeners might start to sense that this five-stock sampler has beaten the market. I'll do the numbers in a sec. But the other three companies we haven't talked about yet are from worst to first, the middle three. Nintendo, which is up 68%, that's not bad. Fair Isaac Corporation (NYSE: FICO), up 70%, also ahead of the market. Then Twitter (NYSE: TWTR) up 92%, a market beater as well. Four of these five companies beat the market. Pick and choose, what do you want to say about any of those three companies?
El-Shimy: Sure. It's hard for me to look at those three other companies there and specially look at Twitter and feel that there was not a missed opportunity here to have gone probably for Snapchat (NYSE: SNAP), take a simple snap. It would've been perfect for this five-stock sampler. That stock outperformed the S&P 500 by nearly 350% over that time period.
Gardner: Wow.
El-Shimy: But Twitter probably would pass the snap test a lot easier than Snapchat would.
Gardner: I'm going to say maybe I didn't pass this snap test here with these five stocks. I've never recommended Snapchat but now I'm wishing I did. That performance has smoked all five of these companies maybe combined.
El-Shimy: Exactly. But Twitter did beat the S&P 500 over that period of time and it was actually the second best performer. There is a lot of controversy surrounding that company. There were probably a lot of reasons why people were hesitant to endorse Twitter as a stock initially, but then came around to it. But I think this company has continued to show that it was really a tool for people to communicate, especially related to political news, business news, everything that's happening in the here and now, and it's a more of a global phenomenon, not just an American social media company. Everyone throughout the world uses Twitter. Everyone at least I know of uses Twitter including in Egypt. It has just been a very impressive company. The other company I would really like to talk about here is Nintendo, which to me is a very impressive, vertically integrated Japanese video gaming company that develops their own games in-house as well as make the platform on which these games are played in-house as well. This company is to me the international equivalent of Disney and I think you once called it the Disney of the East, I believe it. It creates lovable characters, fantastical realms that capture our imagination, and like Disney also, both kids and adults enjoy their products. The only surprise I had with Nintendo was that it had not outperformed by even more. That perhaps shows that there is still room for upside, there is room for optionality in that business. They have a wealth of IP that can be utilized to create theme parks, to create entertainment of all sorts like Disney and perhaps they're just only now getting started.
Gardner: That's a really good insight and indeed as we picked Nintendo for Motley Fool Stock Advisor, you're remembering the thinking and reminding us of the write-up and thank you for that, Yasser and I do think there is an opportunity. Now, the theme park business hasn't been a great business to be in last year or two for very obvious reasons. But boy, if it doesn't seem like Nintendo has created universally recognized and beloved characters. When you said you also want to talk about Nintendo, I find myself just smiling. Nintendo just makes me smile, I'm a gamer, I raised my kids a little bit on some of the Nintendo characters and we're halfway across the world from Japan. So, I really do think that there is more optionality there and we'll see how well management handles that. Let me mention by the way, just in lieu of news just this week, we were talking earlier about transparency and I was reading in the Economist Espresso app, a one paragraph summary this morning, I haven't gone deep on it, but it's worth noting that, ""Twitter,"" I read, ""lost liability protection against user-generated content in India this week following a court ruling. The government repeatedly criticized the company for failing to comply with rules introduced in May that require social media firms to appoint compliance officers and swiftly respond to legal requests to remove user's posts. The company has previously said it was making all efforts to comply.""
Well, I don't know enough to say who is right in that situation, but I do know enough to say that's one of the reason Twitter is a snap test company, because when you start making worldwide headlines for how important what you're doing or not doing is, that's actually a pretty good indicator I think for us as stock market investors and indeed Twitter, as just about double over these last two years, has been a great stock to be in. Well take it all-in-all, the stock market as I mentioned was up 52.7% from June 5th of 2019, these five stocks from the worst performer Live Nation up about 37% to the best Axon up about 157%. These five stocks have an average of 84.9% gain, that is 32.2% per stock ahead of the market averages. That's been a really good sampler. I'm glad Yasser that these ones worked up because I've put myself out there with the snap test. If you're going to write about it a few decades ago and then use it to guide you and then you're going to brand just almost a random group of five stocks two years ago with this brand that it's carrying a brand here, so I'm glad to know we're beating the market handily at least after the first two years. Any final thoughts from you, Yasser El-Shimy, on the snap tests or life in general?
El-Shimy: Yes. I believe the snap test is a strong methodology that many investors should actually use when evaluating companies that they're about to recommend or about to buy personally. As an analyst, I have developed my own checklist of items that I look for when I evaluate companies. However, having read and studied and listened to you talking about the snap test over the years, I realized that I need to also compile my own snap list and that's exactly what I've been doing. So, every year I write five companies that I think should stand the snap test in five to 10 years and I keep track. So thank you David for introducing this concept to us and really appreciate it.
Gardner: Thank you, Yasser, and thank you for pointing out that Snapchat greater than signs snap test at least over the last two years because what a comeback for the team over there at Snap. But thank you for that insight as well and for all that work and Fool on.
El-Shimy: Fool on!
Gardner: It's time to make the way-back music machine hum one more time. Here we are, it's July 4th of 2018. Now, while that was a holiday here in the United States, it was worldwide the time of the World Cup, it was the 2018 World Cup. So I had the World Cup on my mind as I thought about five stocks to celebrate the 2018 World Cup, which I was really enjoying at the time. I'm one of those people who really only tunes into soccer or football, if you will, about once every four years. For the men's and the women's World Cup, I tend to get compelled by the World Cup. I admittedly don't spend a lot of time watching soccer outside of that. But it was fun to pick this five-stock sampler and here with me to review these five stocks, my friend, Sanmeet Deo. Sanmeet, so good to be with you.
Sanmeet Deo: Hi, David. How are you? Great to be here.
Gardner: I'm doing really well, and I knew which three samplers we would be covering this week because I have it in this spreadsheet, but I didn't know which would be assigned to which of you, so I just randomized. So, Alicia got Five Stocks for America and Yasser got Five Stocks that Pass the Snap Test. When I randomly sent you these five stocks to cover, Sanmeet, you told me you're a soccer fan.
Deo: Yeah, mostly football and basketball, but I love soccer. I studied abroad in Italy actually and so that's where my love of soccer grew from on the world stage. So I try to watch the World Cup as often as I can and it's exciting and now I'm watching the Euro Cup as it's playing out.
Gardner: I've watched some of it too and it is. So, maybe it's that I just don't like the regular season, like, just give me the post season or the tournaments and I'll watch your sport, almost whatever your sport is. Well, Sanmeet, let's talk a little bit before we get to these five stocks about your background. We heard some from Alicia where she had come from, some from Yasser where he had. Where were you, I'm just going to ask you arbitrarily, 10 years ago? I know you're at The Motley Fool today where you've worked for us maybe for six or eight months, I'm making that up. But tell us a little bit about where you came from.
Deo: Yes. 10 years ago I was actually working at an investment firm, this was 2011. I was working at a growth stock investment firm and then after that I worked at a value investment firm. So I've been on both sides of the spectrum in terms of investing. But I have always been a Motley Fool member, fan. I've been reading since the AOL days to date myself.
Gardner: Wow.
Deo: I remember logging on there just learning about mutual funds, and just personal finance, and that's where my level of finance grew actually. I was a pre-med student in college, and I switched to pre-med and business, and then eventually I just dropped the pre-med and decided to stick with business.
Gardner: It's a little bit of an easier route through school. Can we agree?
Deo: Yeah. Absolutely. I did it before taking the MCAT or going too hard in, although I had two pre-med classes left to go to finish.
Gardner: Wow.
Deo: It was a little late, but it's OK.
Gardner: I guess to make up for it, Sanmeet, you married a physician.
Deo: Yeah, and I took the better route.
Gardner: Marry the person who goes all the way through pre-med, and then just keeps going. Not a bad approach to life. Now, I know you're a sports fan because I'm pretty sure you're a University of Texas grad or at least fan, but probably a grad too. Is that right?
Deo: Oh, yeah, I'm a grad University of Texas and I'm a huge Texas Longhorn fan. In fact, my TMF name is TMFHorns.
Gardner: Okay. Good. Hook them Horns. I'm with you on the burnt orange. I've always been a fan of Texas. It's fun.
Deo: Yes.
Gardner: We got your football coach back Mack Brown.
Deo: We did.
Gardner: You stole him from us and then we got him back, and we're now a top 20 team again. I wonder why.
Deo: He's great.
Gardner: Yes, it's been fun. Two big state universities that we both hail from, although based on your name Sanmeet, I'm assuming you're of Indian descent, and/or do you have some family still back in India?
Deo: Yes, I do. Actually, my parents were born, brought up in India, and pretty much all my family is in India. I have a couple of cousins here in the United States, but all my family is in India.
Gardner: Do you get back from time to time, and would you like to identify where they are? Big city somewhere?
Deo: It's actually a big city now, it's called Pune, which is just like a couple of hours away from Mumbai which is the big city that everyone knows about. Haven't been in a long, long time. Obviously, it's been hard to travel the past couple of years, and also my wife and I had kids so it's a little difficult to travel when they're very young. But I used to go when I was younger, saw my grandparents, my aunts, and uncles, and just enjoyed spending time there when I was younger as well.
Gardner: Excellent. Before we get into these five stocks celebrating sports, would you like to share your greatest personal moment in sports? Were you a high school football player, did you hit that big home run in little league? When did you peak Sanmeet?
Deo: In sports I will say, I hate to sound like Al Bundy here, but I did play [laughs] high school football in Texas. I think our peak was when we beat our rival school. I went to Taylor High School and we played Katy High School, which is a perennial state contender, and my senior year we beat them. I didn't play, but we beat them. It was awesome. It was just a great feeling.
Gardner: I bet. Wonderful. Well, thank you for sharing that. Let's get into these stocks now. Five Stocks Celebrating The 2018 World Cup, well, we've already heard the market has done pretty well the last few years. Hope you didn't need to hear from this podcast, hope you were already aware of that dear listener. But yeah, the market has been strong. Three years ago, July 4th, 2018, the market since then measured as of course the S&P 500 up 59.7%, so 60%, let's just round it and keep things simple. Pretty great three years for stocks. Happy to say these stocks might have done even better, but no spoilers yet. Let's start, Sanmeet, with the worst of the Five Stocks Celebrating The 2018 World Cup. It happens to be the company that helps me get in the game, the company that makes the FIFA video games, among others, Electronic Arts (NASDAQ: EA), ticker symbol EA. EA is up 1.2%. We've held it for three years now, it's up 1%, markets up 60%. Sanmeet, what's going on?
Deo: Well, I mean, it's great to have a sample where the worst performers are still up and absolute terms. That's pretty awesome. Electronic Arts is known for its sports games, that's a staple of their business with titles like Madden, FIFA, some others in the sporting area. One of the things that they've, I don't want to say stumbled, but some concerns were in terms of their creation of action-adventure games, and they had some early on in the stock picks life throughout the sampler period. It had some lackluster results in the live services business, it had some cancellations and delays in some of their games. One was Battlefield V, one was a Star Wars game. But I have to say one of the biggest challenges I think from this time is a game that we all probably have heard of is Fortnite. That is a hugely popular game with massive appeal, and is able to generate tons of revenue without even the need for a lot of costly development. That shift in gaming did hurt Electronic Arts in the sense that they didn't have a strong action-adventure business. That did hurt them a little early on, but then they are starting to get in gear, the pandemic was a tailwind in terms of game-play. They released a popular game called Apex Legends, which surpassed 10 million players in its first 72 hours. They've continued their state performance in the sports games. Now it's aggressively pursuing acquisitions in the mobile game space with the purchase of Glu Mobile and Playdemic. Even with the challenges and the fact that the stocks underperform, it still has gaming as a favorable tailwind, has a high-quality game portfolio, and solid game development plans. I still think it can do pretty well given where it's at.
Gardner: It crested to about $150. Again, this is a stock picked for this sampler when it was three years ago, it was at about $141, so it crests briefly after we picked it up to about $150, and then nose-dived for the second half of 2018. As Fortnite really started to heat up, nose-dived from about $150 to about $75, it got cut in half in six months. It's been coming back ever since a little bit slowly. This is a bigger company. This is not like Zynga, which can acquire apparently a hyper-casual game. Have you hyper-casual games, by the way, Sanmeet?
Deo: No, I have not. My kids may have.
Gardner: It probably can get expensive. Even though it's merely casual, but hyper-casual. But this is a company that can't make a small acquisition like that, and all of a sudden start to zing up or down. This is a bigger, steadier, slower mover, but certainly a long-term outperformer, a company I'm very grateful that it exists. I've enjoyed the FIFA game even though I'm not that good at it, or much of a soccer fan, so we'll hope for better things for Electronic Arts. Again, it's been pretty solid except for the six months right after I picked it. Here it is, just up 1%, again, the market up about 60%. That puts us at -59% in the hole with this first company. Let's now go from worst to best. The best performer, really happy to think that I picked this stock in July 2018, Sanmeet. The ticker symbol MELI, the company, of course, MercadoLibre (NASDAQ: MELI), a longtime Rule Breaker winner, one of those that we just keep adding to, even though it's already done really well, we add some more as it goes up. Back then it was at $297.43 as the market closed on July 3rd, 2018, so $297, today $1,549 and change. It's been up more than five times the value 421% gain against the market 60%. This has been a good antidote to EA's underperformance. Sanmeet, what the heck is happening in Latin America?
Deo: Wow. All I have to say is I wish I didn't miss the boat on this one, but I'm kicking myself if you like to indulge in my pun there. But I saw a fantastic quote by a long-term investor, it sums up the company best. They said MercadoLibre's greatest virtue over the years was the ability to identify relevant trends early on, adapt to them, to local conditions, and above all implement them at the right time with precision, agility, and scale. I thought that was a great snapshot of what they've done. Just over the sampler time period it's growth can be attributed to COVID tailwinds, accelerating the shift toward online shopping. The company is transformed from a superior third-party marketplace to a leading e-commerce, ecosystem, and digital financial services platform in Latin America. They increased revenue 90% in 2020, and the number of buyers on the marketplace grew 40% to 65 million in the 12 months ended in March. Not only is it changing the way people shop, but it changes the way they pay with Mercado Pago, whose payment volume increased 75% to $50 billion last year. Interestingly, in 2018, it was estimated by Goldman that 40% of the company's value came from financial services and now that's up to 60%. While there's concerns that the growth could slow as the pandemic subsides. They're committed to plowing back that money to capture market share, double its workforce, and continue to invest in retail and financial services. As more users and merchants join the ecosystem, it's going to lead to more monetization opportunities and it's a beast.
Gardner: Very well expressed and very true. I like the quota you pulled as well. I think that's excellent coverage of what MercadoLibre has done. In a sense it's a fast follower of Amazon in an area of the world that it dominates. Amazon couldn't really establish that much of a foothold, eBay owned a good portion of MercadoLibre. Pretty sure they wish they had held onto that. They sold that, they had some positioning there. But wow, what a wonderful performer this has been for just more than a decade for Rule Breaker members. If you're a Rule Breaker member and Sanmeet, you are, and it sounds like this one got away from you, but I know you're kicking yourself. Pun intended, thanks to my friend, Sanmeet, you already made the joke. But the good news is none of us has to own any one given winner, and in fact, we're never going to own them all. One of my better stock picks along with Karl Thiel in Rule Breaker is Shopify (NYSE: SHOP). I've never owned any Shopify. I'm so glad so many Motley Fool members own Shopify and have benefited. But I still don't feel any Shopify envy because I'm really happy about how my money has been invested. We've done great with stocks like MercadoLibre for example. I don't think you can ever have them all, but thank you for sharing that.
Well, Sanmeet, let's look at the three that are in the middle. There's a pretty wide middle between a 1% gain EA and a 421% gain Mercado Libre. But we're looking here at Booking Holdings (NASDAQ: BKNG), up 8%, Dassault Systemes up 79%, beating the market. Yandex (NASDAQ: YNDX) up 101%, also beating the market. Again, three different businesses all related in some way, at least in my mind, to the World Cup booking with a dominant position, booking.com, travel in Europe. Dassault Systemes, well, they were French. They're a great French company and the French won the World Cup. That's where I was headed with that and of course Yandex, the search engine based company, does other things besides like MercadoLibre, but focused on Russia, even though the company is domiciled outside of Russia. Of course, Russia is hosting the World Cup, as you reminded me just before we came on air Sanmeet. That was some of the reasoning behind these companies. Do you want to pick up any of those stories and make us smarter?
Deo: Yeah, absolutely. Booking you would think, wow, for Booking it is the worst time for a global pandemic. But Booking is so great. Its proposition was competitively lease hotels and alternative accommodations at the same pace offers superior experience for customers as they compete with some of the rival pure-play alternative accommodation companies such as Airbnb (NASDAQ: ABNB), which we know of for sure. Bookings were hit very hard during the pandemic. At its deepest despair, revenues were down over 80%. It has the largest exposure to Europe and various hotspots occurring all over the world and different vaccination trends all over the globe is making the recovery difficult for booking. However, it has a huge and global brand. It's all over, and has a highly variable cost structure with high exposure to the alternative accommodations that I mentioned. It's been able to withstand some of the weakness from that, and there's a huge pent-up demand for travel. I think they're going to capture that as we go forward. In fact, I was just on Booking the other day looking for my first trip post pandemic.
Gardner: Excellent.
Deo: I think it's going to be just fine.
Gardner: Glad to hear that. Yeah, you are right. Wow, it is a big dog company and still a worldwide leader at what it does. But what it does as you just mentioned hasn't been so easy to do business with for an extended period of time. A company up only 8% over these three years. I definitely wasn't able to predict anything about a coronavirus back as I was enjoying the World Cup in 2018. But I'm happy to say the companies made it through to the other end. I hope we're near the other end and we should see business pickup again. Any thoughts to share before we closed about Dassault Systemes or Yandex?
Deo: Well, Dassault Systemes is actually interesting, I was looking and I was doing research and I didn't find too much actually to guide me in what, why it's done what it has done. But what's great about it is it's consistently grown revenues and some of its key metrics in new license sales and revenue from its 3D experience platform over the past few years has just grown at a steady clip over time and it's acquired metadata solutions, which operates in clinical trial automation space, and some other companies to expand its verticals from aerospace, automotive, and other things that they do. It's just a nice one to point out because it's a steady grower that grew over time with not much going on in terms of news, and it's not one that people might even know about, but it's performed well as a business over that time.
Gardner: Wonderful. Well, take it all-in-all. Really happy to say that these Five Stocks Celebrating The 2018 World Cup are beating the market and very handily so. The market averages, as I mentioned, 59.7%. Since July 4th of 2018, these stocks averaged 122.1% gain. That puts us about 62.5% per stock ahead of the market averages. Yeah, we're still celebrating the 2018 World Cup, and speaking of which, this is one of those rare samplers Sanmeet that does not end after three years. No, because we made it a World Cup cycle, so we're going to keep this one open for four years and revisit it one more time. Perhaps I'll have you to do it with me a year from now, how these closeout somewhere around July 4th of 2022. But anyway, for now, I'm really happy to say that these five stocks, along with the other two samplers, are all well ahead of the market averages, which I hope is testament not just to what I've always believed, which is that you can, whoever you are, you can beat the market averages. I realized not a lot of people even believe that, especially in academia, it still seems you can, and here's the way to do it, by following our Rule Breaker principles and/or follow right along with what we're doing at Motley Fool Rule Breakers, whether it's the samplers here through this podcast as I've done over the last six years, or of course, the Rule Breakers service, which many of us work on.
Of course, all the Motley Fool services, most of us are predicated on beating the market averages and have a transparent record of having done just that. Thank you, Sanmeet, for the magic dust that you've somehow sprinkled on these stocks even before you got to our company and for the work ahead. Speaking of work, I'm curious, having come from Wall Street, as you mentioned, you were working in New York, you were at a growth firm, you were at a value firm. What are one or two insights that you have having come from Wall Street to us here at Fool Street reflecting on your past life? Maybe a good thing and a bad thing. I'm not asking you to tar and feather Wall Street at all. There's some very admirable things about Wall Street.
Deo: No, absolutely. I think one of the reasons why I love The Fool and I've been a member for so long is I actually learned so much from being a Fool subscriber and the newsletters and services that I've subscribed to about companies and stock-picking. I really feel one of the reasons I joined the company, Motley Fool, is because as an individual investor, you don't need to work on Wall Street. You can use the observations in the world, see what products and services are being used, see what your kids are doing, see what's happening to really make stock-picks. One of the things that I love about the sampler and all these samplers is that you can pick five things from a theme that you like, like the World Cup, and as MercadoLibre showed, you have a five-bagger almost. That outperformed and helped your broader portfolio do well. You had one pick that did phenomenally and the other pick still did good, but maybe some under performed, but you have that one that did phenomenal and it helped your portfolio overall. I think as a competitive advantage for Fools everywhere is you are a Fool, you are out there, you're observing what's happening in the world. I think you can be just as good a stock picker as anyone. That's a pro.
Gardner: That's wonderful. One of things I loved about Peter Lynch and the spirit of his books One Up On Wall Street, etc, was, you can do this. That's what he wrote. He wrote to people, younger people like me, impressionable at the time, you can beat the market. He had just done so over a very successful career with Fidelity and their Magellan fund, and yet he wrote a book about all the disadvantages he suffered from. He had to keep constantly diversifying. That means you have to keep rebalancing away from his winners toward his losers, for example. He could never allow a certain stock to grow beyond a certain percentage of his portfolio. These are principles that make sense, but they're highly enforced and regulated and that's something you and I don't have to do. We can actually let our idiosyncrasies shine and we can take a little bit more risk if that's appropriate for us, or less risk if that's appropriate for us. We can make it our own as individual investors. I love that you get that spirit from a long time Fool member yourself, Sanmeet, who's been practicing that as well. Well, thank you very much for the work you put in this week over a busy weekend helping us understand Five Stocks Celebrating The 2018 World Cup. Fool on, my friend.
Deo: Fool on.
Gardner: All right. Well, as the smoke clears, let me first of all thank my talented analyst Alicia Alfiere again, Yasser El-Shimy, and Sanmeet Deo. A delight to spend that time. I know you had fun with each of them. In order, Five Stocks for America, which Alicia reviewed, up 72% on average versus the market's 36%. A double of the market averages a nice start for the first year. Five Stocks That Pass The Snap Test, up 86% versus the market's 53%. We'll keep our fingers crossed and keep snapping for another 12 months for that one. Then. Five Stocks Celebrating The 2018 World Cup, the market up 60%, those stocks up 122%. That's another double of the market averages. Really, just outstanding performance with only one duplication Axon popping in a couple of those. But overall, you have a pretty good group of 15 companies that I feel just as good about today. I think as I did back then. Well, a reminder as I say goodbye to you for this week, really, rubbing my hands together for next week, having our first Foolish NFL head coach come on the podcast join me and tell his story. Using our framework, start of your life in a few sentences at least, the stock graph of his life if you were to trace it out on paper speaking of some of the highs and the lows. Of course, the three key moments that have made him the investor that he is today, looking forward to introducing my new friend to you next week. In the meantime, Fool on!

2021-07-22 00:00:00+00:00,September 3rd Options Now Available For eBay,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/september-3rd-options-now-available-for-ebay-2021-07-22,,,"Investors in eBay Inc. (Symbol: EBAY) saw new options become available today, for the September 3rd expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the EBAY options chain for the new September 3rd contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $71.00 strike price has a current bid of $2.33. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $71.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $68.67 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of EBAY, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $71.99/share today.
Because the $71.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 100%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 3.28% return on the cash commitment, or 27.86% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for eBay Inc., and highlighting in green where the $71.00 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $73.00 strike price has a current bid of $2.53. If an investor was to purchase shares of EBAY stock at the current price level of $71.99/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $73.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 4.92% if the stock gets called away at the September 3rd expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if EBAY shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for eBay Inc., as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing EBAY's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $73.00 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $73.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 53%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 3.51% boost of extra return to the investor, or 29.83% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.
The implied volatility in the call contract example above is 35%.
Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $71.99) to be 35%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

SYDNEY, July 22 (Reuters) - The Australian antitrust regulator on Thursday began an inquiry into the local units of Amazon.com Inc, AMZN.O eBay Inc EBAY.O and other online markets to ensure fairness in a sector where sales have soared through the coronavirus pandemic.
The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), which previously slapped the world's toughest content licencing rules on Facebook Inc and Alphabet Inc's GOOGL.O Google, said it was now looking at retail as part of a wider examination of so-called Big Tech.
""Online marketplaces are an important and growing segment of the economy so it is important that we understand how online marketplaces operate and whether they are working effectively for consumers and businesses,"" ACCC Chair Rod Sims said in a statement.
""We want to be sure that the rules that apply to traditional retail are also complied with in the online context.""
The ACCC would take submissions until mid-August with a final report due in March 2022, the regulator said.
An Amazon spokesperson said the company looked ""forward to engaging with the ACCC on these important topics in the coming months"", while an eBay representative was not immediately available for comment.
The Australian regulator said it would examine the relationships between large online markets and third-party sellers and shoppers, including competition impacts and handling of data, complaints and reviews.
Amazon has not reached the market dominance in Australia since launching in 2017 that it experiences elsewhere, but still doubled sales in calendar 2020, the ACCC said.
Overall, Australian online purchases jumped 57% in 2020 for a record $50.5 billion spend amid a series of coronavirus lockdowns, it added.
The ACCC said it had received wide-ranging complaints, including the ""quality of goods sold on marketplaces, the timeliness of payment remittance to sellers, how goods are put on display on marketplaces, and the level of support provided by marketplaces to consumers when disputes arise"".
The ACCC has been conducting a series of investigations in recent months as part of a broader Digital Platform Services Inquiry.

2021-07-21 00:00:00+00:00,Massachusetts couple sues eBay over 'unrelenting' harassment campaign,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/massachusetts-couple-sues-ebay-over-unrelenting-harassment-campaign-2021-07-21,,,"By Jonathan Stempel
July 21 (Reuters) - A Massachusetts couple sued eBay Inc EBAY.O on Wednesday for being subjected to an ""unrelenting stream"" of threats by its employees to stifle their online newsletter critical of the e-commerce company.
In a complaint filed in Boston federal court, David and Ina Steiner accused eBay of conspiring through its employees and contractors to ""intimidate, threaten to kill, torture, terrorize, stalk and silence them"" for their reporting in the newsletter, EcommerceBytes.
Federal prosecutors have said the Steiners were subjected in the summer of 2019 to anonymous email and Twitter threats; covert surveillance; deliveries to their home including live cockroaches, a bloody Halloween pig mask and a funeral wreath; and pornography sent in their names to neighbors.
At least seven people have been criminally charged, and five have pleaded guilty, according to court records.
In response to a request for comment about the lawsuit, eBay said: ""The misconduct of these former employees was wrong, and we will do what is fair and appropriate to try to address what the Steiners went through. We are very sorry for what they endured.""
EBay has said it has cooperated with prosecutors.
The cyberstalking campaign began shortly after the Natick, Massachusetts couple published an article concerning a lawsuit filed by eBay, prosecutors said.
In their 93-page complaint, the Steiners said the harassment caused them emotional distress, including a perpetual fear of being followed, and hurt their newsletter because sources and customers worry they could become eBay's next victims.
They are seeking unspecified damages from San Jose, California-based eBay and several former employees, including two former security executives, for the harassment.
The case is Steiner et al v eBay Inc et al, U.S. District Court, District of Massachusetts, No. 21-11181.

2021-07-15 00:00:00+00:00,New Investor? Here Are 3 Great Starter Stocks,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/new-investor-here-are-3-great-starter-stocks-2021-07-15,,,"Setting up a stock portfolio can be a daunting task for new investors, since there are thousands of stocks on the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq alone. It can also be tough to tune out all the financial gurus babbling about hot stocks and alternative investments like cryptocurrencies, SPACs, and NFTs.
But creating a starter portfolio actually isn't as hard as it seems. I personally prefer to split my portfolio between three kinds of investments: blue-chip dividend stalwarts, traditional growth stocks, and speculative stocks that either go bust or generate incredible multibagger gains in the future.
Image source: Getty Images.
Generally speaking, new investors should allocate more than 90% of their portfolio to blue-chip dividend stocks or traditional growth stocks, and the remaining 10% to speculative stocks. To get started, let's pick one top stock from each category.
1. Coca-Cola: The blue-chip stalwart
Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) has raised its dividend annually for 59 straight years, which makes it a Dividend King of the S&P 500. Companies join that elite club after raising their payouts annually for at least half a century.
Coca-Cola pays a forward yield of 3.1% today, which is much higher than the 10-Year Treasury's 1.4% yield. It spent 90% of its free cash flow (FCF) on those dividends over the past 12 months.
Coca-Cola might initially seem like a weak investment since soda consumption rates are declining worldwide. However, Coca-Cola has diversified its portfolio with teas, juices, sports drinks, bottled water, and even alcoholic beverages, as well as healthier versions and new flavors of its flagship sodas.
Over the past 10 years, Coca-Cola generated a total return of about 120% after factoring in reinvested dividends. Past performance doesn't guarantee future gains, but its steady growth should continue for decades to come. That's why Warren Buffett is still one of Coca-Cola's top investors.
Coca-Cola's organic revenue and core EPS fell last year as the pandemic shut down restaurants, but analysts expect its revenue and earnings to both rise 12% this year as the pandemic eases. The stock trades at a reasonable 23 times forward earnings, and it remains a great defensive stock to buy and hold.
2. PayPal: The traditional growth stock
eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY) spun off its payments subsidiary PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ: PYPL) in an IPO in 2015. Each investor received one share of PayPal for every share of eBay they owned, but PayPal subsequently generated much bigger gains than its former parent company.
Source: YCharts
It might seem risky to chase PayPal after those massive gains, but it's still firing on all cylinders. Last year PayPal's total payment volume (TPV) jumped 31% to $936 billion, its revenue rose 21% to $21.45 billion, and its adjusted EPS grew 31%. Wall Street expects its revenue and adjusted earnings to increase another 21% and 22%, respectively, this year.
PayPal ended the first quarter of 2021 with 392 million active accounts, up 21% from the previous year and reinforcing its position as one of the world's largest digital payment networks. PayPal also recently raised its processing fees for U.S. merchants, which indicates it's confident in the stickiness of its ecosystem and its pricing power in the competitive payments market.
PayPal's stock trades at just over 50 times forward earnings, which makes it cheaper than industry peers Square and Adyen. That balance of growth and value makes PayPal a great long-term investment on the escalating war on cash worldwide.
3. Lemonade: The speculative growth stock
Lemonade (NYSE: LMND) shouldn't be a core holding for new investors, but its disruptive potential is tough to ignore. Its eponymous app streamlines the byzantine process of buying insurance with an AI-powered chatbot that insures users within 90 seconds and processes most claims within three minutes. This simple approach, which bypasses salespeople and unifies home, renters, pet, and life insurance within a single app, is catching on with younger insurance buyers.
Approximately 70% of Lemonade's customers are under the age of 35, and many of them are first-time insurance buyers. Its total number of customers jumped 56% in fiscal 2020, then grew another 50% year over year to nearly 1.1 million in the first quarter of 2021. Its premium per customer also rose 82% in 2020 and increased 25% year over year in the first quarter.
If Lemonade gains tens of millions of new customers over the next few years, it could become a major threat to traditional insurers. It plans to expand into the auto insurance market this year, and a move into the fragmented health insurance market could be game-changing.
For now, Lemonade's stock looks very expensive. It expects its revenue to rise 24%-28% this year, but the stock trades at nearly 50 times that estimate. It won't generate a profit anytime soon, and it's still reeling from claims related to the winter storm in Texas earlier this year.
However, investors looking for a speculative bet that could outperform both blue-chip dividend stocks and traditional growth stocks should take a much closer look at this online insurer.

2021-07-15 00:00:00+00:00,3 Top Stocks in Fintech,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-top-stocks-in-fintech-2021-07-15,,,"Financial technology, or fintech, is much bigger than the giant payments companies that get most of the attention. It also comprises many smaller innovators like card issuer Marqeta and lending platform Upstart Holdings, as well as traditional financial firms that have embraced new technology, like Goldman Sachs. The industry has exploded as digital advances change how people make purchases and manage their money, and that spells opportunity for investors.
Each of these stocks has merit as a potential investment. But for the top three in the sector, I'm going to stick with three heavyweights, all of which are still growing despite their size: PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ: PYPL), Square (NYSE: SQ), and Latin American fintech MercadoLibre (NASDAQ: MELI).

The leader of the pack
Payments juggernaut PayPal, most noted for its namesake platform and Venmo app, sits comfortably atop the fintech ladder, with more than $21 billion in revenue last year and nearly $1 trillion in total payment volume (TPV). But it's still growing fast, with what it touted as the strongest results in its history in the first quarter of 2021. TPV increased 50% year over year in Q1, and it added more than 14 million net active accounts to reach 392 million, which is more than the U.S. population. Based on that phenomenal performance, PayPal raised its second-quarter guidance to 30% TPV growth and 20% revenue growth.
The company is investing in its infrastructure and options to keep up with the changing pace of digital payments and grow its sales. Most recently, it launched Zettle in the U.S., a point-of-sale solution for small businesses that allows them to take and track digital and in-store payments in one place. That's a direct move to enter Square's territory. It also entered cryptocurrency last year, rolling out buy and sell options on its Venmo payments app.
As large as PayPal is, in some ways it's just starting out. Digital payments are still in their infancy, and the potential is enormous. It sees a $110 trillion addressable market and $50 billion in sales -- more than double its 2020 total -- by 2025.
The up-and-coming challenger
Square has had an exciting story since it rolled out its first credit card reader in 2010 and went public five years later. Growth has been fantastic, with 101% year-over-year revenue growth in 2020 and 266% in the first quarter of 2021.
Square's financial results are not as consistent as PayPal's, and it posted losses in the first two quarters of 2020. That's common with high-growth companies, but those quarters also represented a setback for Square's sellers business, which mostly comprises small businesses that were severely impacted by the pandemic. However, the company rebounded as the economy began reopening, and it has posted a profit for the past three quarters. In Q1 2021, gross profit increased 79% year over year.
Square operates separate two separate ecosystems, its sellers business and the Cash App peer-to-peer payments platform. While all of Square's parts are growing, its big story is Cash App, which competes with PayPal and Venmo. Cash App accounted for most of the company's recent growth, and within Cash App, growth came mostly from cryptocurrency sales, which the company reports as revenue. Without cryptocurrency, Q1 revenue growth came in at 44%. Cash App is also a gross profit machine, soaring 171% versus the seller's program's 32% increase.
I wouldn't worry about Square's seeming dependency on cryptocurrency, since both of its businesses are growing at a fast clip, and the company is demonstrating its ability to enter new areas, a sign of future growth.

Powering digital payments in Latin America
MercadoLibre's main business is e-commerce. It operates websites similar to eBay and Amazon in 18 countries in Latin America, and those pulled in nearly $1 billion in the first quarter of 2021. While it's based in Argentina, its biggest market is the region's largest country, Brazil, where gross merchandise volume increased 92% and items sold more than doubled in Q1.
But MercadoLibre also has a powerful digital payments business called MercadoPago, and that places it in the fintech box. The company's fintech revenue increased 117% to $465 million in Q1, making up about a third of its total. That's way behind Square's $5.1 billion and PayPal's $6.0 billion, but it also means there's a lot of upward opportunity.
Total payment volume grew 129% (without adjusting for currency effects) in Q1 to almost $15 billion, and total payment transactions increased 116%. Off-platform growth, which measures MercadoPago usage outside of the MercadoLibre platform, increased at a slightly higher rate.South America is lagging in digital payment adoption, but it also has a high growth rate. That's puts MercadoLibre in the perfect position to grow its business as consumers in its market switch from cash to digital payments.
MercadoLibre is the leader in all of its markets and is keeping up triple-digit growth while it pursues enormous opportunities in commerce and digital payments. Investing in that growth means net income has been negative more often than not lately. But the company ended the first quarter with almost $2 billion in cash, which it's using to expand its presence in its various markets as the population embraces new technology, making this a compelling story.
