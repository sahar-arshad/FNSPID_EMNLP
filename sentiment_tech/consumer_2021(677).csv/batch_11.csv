2021-11-25 00:00:00+00:00,Why You Might Be Interested In eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY) For Its Upcoming Dividend,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-you-might-be-interested-in-ebay-inc.-nasdaq%3Aebay-for-its-upcoming-dividend,,,"eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY) stock is about to trade ex-dividend in four days. The ex-dividend date occurs one day before the record date which is the day on which shareholders need to be on the company's books in order to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is important as the process of settlement involves two full business days. So if you miss that date, you would not show up on the company's books on the record date. In other words, investors can purchase eBay's shares before the 30th of November in order to be eligible for the dividend, which will be paid on the 17th of December.
The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.18 per share, and in the last 12 months, the company paid a total of US$0.72 per share. Last year's total dividend payments show that eBay has a trailing yield of 1.0% on the current share price of $72.66. Dividends are a major contributor to investment returns for long term holders, but only if the dividend continues to be paid. So we need to investigate whether eBay can afford its dividend, and if the dividend could grow.
Dividends are usually paid out of company profits, so if a company pays out more than it earned then its dividend is usually at greater risk of being cut. eBay is paying out just 24% of its profit after tax, which is comfortably low and leaves plenty of breathing room in the case of adverse events. A useful secondary check can be to evaluate whether eBay generated enough free cash flow to afford its dividend. Luckily it paid out just 18% of its free cash flow last year.
It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.

NasdaqGS:EBAY Historic Dividend November 25th 2021
Have Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?
Companies with consistently growing earnings per share generally make the best dividend stocks, as they usually find it easier to grow dividends per share. If business enters a downturn and the dividend is cut, the company could see its value fall precipitously. For this reason, we're glad to see eBay's earnings per share have risen 14% per annum over the last five years. The company has managed to grow earnings at a rapid rate, while reinvesting most of the profits within the business. This will make it easier to fund future growth efforts and we think this is an attractive combination - plus the dividend can always be increased later.
Another key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. In the last three years, eBay has lifted its dividend by approximately 8.7% a year on average. It's encouraging to see the company lifting dividends while earnings are growing, suggesting at least some corporate interest in rewarding shareholders.
Final Takeaway
Is eBay worth buying for its dividend? We love that eBay is growing earnings per share while simultaneously paying out a low percentage of both its earnings and cash flow. These characteristics suggest the company is reinvesting in growing its business, while the conservative payout ratio also implies a reduced risk of the dividend being cut in the future. eBay looks solid on this analysis overall, and we'd definitely consider investigating it more closely.
So while eBay looks good from a dividend perspective, it's always worthwhile being up to date with the risks involved in this stock. Case in point: We've spotted 2 warning signs for eBay you should be aware of.
A common investment mistake is buying the first interesting stock you see. Here you can find a list of promising dividend stocks with a greater than 2% yield and an upcoming dividend.

2021-11-23 00:00:00+00:00,Macy's Considering Spinning Off E-Commerce Business,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/macys-considering-spinning-off-e-commerce-business,,,"Macy's (NYSE: M) was devastated by the pandemic when it was forced to shut all its stores to customers. That may have been a blessing in disguise. It forced the company to emphasize its digital business, which is now thriving.
It is doing so well that management is considering spinning it off on its own. Macy's is considering this idea because of the potentially increased value the e-commerce business could have as a separate entity. Let's take a closer look at Macy's digital business.
Image source: Getty Images.
Options for its digital business
Interestingly, Macy's digital sales in the third quarter were 49% higher than in the same quarter in 2019. That figure highlights the impact the pandemic has had on the company's online sales.
In all, digital sales made up 33% of Macy's overall sales in Q3. The dramatic change in consumer behavior at the pandemic's onset has helped Macy's build its online business. Considering a business sale now, when it is arguably the strongest it's ever been, might be a good idea.
Here's what CEO Jeffrey Gennette said about the idea:
This past year, we conducted an analysis of our e-commerce and brick-and-mortar operations, evaluating how each contribute to the value of the company as well as how each benefits from being integrated and working together. In collaboration with our Board and with assistance from our advisors, we look at multiple business models that would create long-term shareholder value while always respecting the omnichannel behavior of the customer. This work supported our digitally led omnichannel Polaris strategy that we are successfully executing.
That said, we also recognize the significant value the market is assigning to pure e-commerce businesses. And as we look at the landscape today, we are undertaking additional analysis that could help inform our long-term strategy to further unlock value for Macy's, Inc. To help in these efforts, we have recently engaged AlixPartners to work with our Board and financial advisors. It is too early to tell what the results of this additional analysis will be, but we plan to update everyone after the work is complete.
Investors will be watching closely. Macy's online business has helped the company bounce back from the devastations of the pandemic and is on pace to reach $10 billion in sales by 2023.
Macy's digital business could be worth close to $40 billion
The market liked what it heard about Macy's possibly spinning off the e-commerce business. The stock price shot up 21% after the earnings announcement and discussion by management.
The company also reported excellent results for the quarter, so it's hard to determine how much of the stock price increase was due to talk off of a spinoff or the latest numbers. Macy's comparable-store sales increased by 37.2% from the same quarter last year and 8.9% over the same quarter in 2019. Additionally, Macy's repaid $1.6 billion in debt ahead of schedule.
Data by Ycharts.
Still, Macy's is trading at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 0.5, far below that of several e-commerce businesses (see chart). The average P/S ratio of the e-commerce businesses listed above is roughly 4. This is what management means when it sees the value a stand-alone e-commerce business could have.
If you combine that with Macy's projected $10 billion in sales for its digital business in 2021, it results in a value of about $40 billion. It's no surprise then why management is considering a sale. Anything close to that value would be substantial, considering Macy's market cap as of this writing is only about $11 billion. Stay tuned.

2021-11-19 00:00:00+00:00,Bezos could be $90 billion richer with Amazon breakup,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/bezos-could-be-%2490-billion-richer-with-amazon-breakup,,,"Reuters
Reuters


NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Jeff Bezos is sitting on an even bigger gold mine than he thinks. His nearly 10% stake in $1.9 trillion Amazon.com is worth some $190 billion. But he could become some 50% richer if the company were to split into two parts. Earlier this year the founder of the e-commerce giant stepped down as its day-to-day leader and handed the reins to Andy Jassy, formerly the top executive of Amazon Web Services, the company's cloud business. That division remains by far the fastest growing and most efficient, posting an operating margin of more than 22% in the last 12 months versus low single digits at Amazon's online-retailing arm. Given how the market is viewing data and cloud-software firms, AWS is also far more valuable. Much smaller but comparable companies like Cloudflare trade at enterprise value-to-estimated sales multiples of as much as 80 times. Firms like Palantir Technologies and Okta, which are different but growing at a similar pace, boast valuations of around 24 times sales. Say Amazonâs cloud business rakes in $75 billion in revenue next year, as D.A. Davidson is estimating. On the same multiple as those latter two firms, it would be worth about the same as Amazon as a whole right now. Sales in 2022 at the North American and international retailing arms could reach almost $500 million, according to Davidson. Pick a revenue multiple of say 2 times, richer than where Target trades but well below eBay's level, and that would add another $1 trillion. On paper, Amazon, with no net debt, could be worth some $2.8 trillion. Bezosâs stake would clock in at almost $280 billion. Such so-called sum-of-the-parts exercises often produce theoretical valuations that are punctured by realities. But several large companies have recently confronted breaking up. Johnson & Johnson, General Electric and Toshiba have set about doing it; Royal Dutch Shell is facing pressure to do so from activist investor Dan Loeb. Shareholders sometimes value focused businesses more highly. And on occasion, as when online retailer eBay spun off its PayPal payments unit in 2015, an offspring outgrows its parent. Thatâs increasingly the case with Amazon. AWS is booming while the retailing arm is facing transportation, supply-chain and labor snags, not to mention scrutiny over competition and privacy issues. Bezos's move into the back seat could come with an even more comfortable cushion.

CONTEXT NEWS
   - Johnson & Johnson said on Nov. 12 that it is planning to break into two companies, splitting off its consumer health division, which sells Band-Aids and Baby Powder, from the large pharmaceuticals unit that makes cancer drugs and vaccines.
    - General Electric said on Nov. 9 that it plans to split into three publicly-listed parts. The U.S. conglomerate will hive off its healthcare business in 2023 and its energy and power division in 2024, leaving its jet-engine division as a stand-alone company.
    - Japanese conglomerate Toshiba said on Nov. 12 it will split itself into three units by spinning off its energy and infrastructure division as well as its device and storage business.

In no particular order, they are:
Shopify
Shopify (NYSE: SHOP) helps businesses of all sorts and sizes build their own e-commerce platform. The company's founders recognized that major online marketplaces like Amazon were difficult to use as a sales venue, so Shopify was built from the ground up with empowerment in mind. As of the latest count, more than 1.7 million businesses are using this company's services, and that number continues to grow.
The evidence of this growth is in the numbers. Through the first nine months of the year, net revenue of more than $3.2 billion was up 66% year over year. Better still, this huge growth has carried Shopify decisively out of the red and into the black. That makes funding future growth considerably easier.
Fiverr International
Fiverr International (NYSE: FVRR) connects freelance workers with organizations that need short-term work done. Website work is its focus, although it's not limited to that.
It's not exactly a new idea. Upwork, Guru, Amazon's Mechanical Turk, and the website Freelancer.com are all in the same business. Fiverr is clearly doing something special, though, on pace to report revenue growth of nearly 55% this year. Next year's projected per-share profit of $0.48 will also set a new record for the company, supported by projected record revenue as well.
MercadoLibre
Amazon might be the dominant e-commerce outfit in your neck of the woods, but your neck of the woods is only one part of the world. Elsewhere, Amazon can be something of an afterthought.
Take South America as an example. While Amazon operates there, the king of e-commerce for most of the developed Latin American marketplace is MercadoLibre (NASDAQ: MELI), often referred to as the Amazon of Latin America, although that's not a perfect description. MercadoLibre also operates a payment platform that looks a lot like PayPal and an online auction service akin to eBay. The wide business mix is working in a big way. Revenue through the first three reported quarters of the year is up almost 90%, while operating income has more than doubled.
And that's just the beginning. Lazard Asset Management estimates Latin America's online retail market will more than triple between 2020 and 2026 with projected sales of $217 billion.
Crocs
Crocs (NASDAQ: CROX), which made its first funky foam clogs two decades ago, saw the popularity of its footwear rise and fall as yet another fad in the fashion industry, but it's back in the spotlight! Only this time, current CEO Andrew Rees understands that for the brand to have staying power, it needs to move like a more conventional company. That includes (among other things) variations on its core theme of comfortable foam shoes, a social-media presence supported by celebrities and influencers, and customization of its product.
The company also brilliantly reframed the idea that its shoes were ugly into the idea that their unique look is a feature linked to function. It's all part of the reason this firmly profitable company's sales are up 77% through the first nine months of the year despite global supply chain headaches, en route to what analysts expect to be a full-year top line of $2.3 billion.
That's still nothing, though. Rees wants to deliver $5 billion in annual sales by 2026, more than doubling management's revenue outlook for about $2.3 billion this year.
Pinduoduo
Finally, add Pinduoduo (NASDAQ: PDD) to your list of fast-growing stocks to take a closer look at.
It's a Chinese company and considered part of the country's technology sector. But that categorization is a bit misleading. Pinduoduo operates an e-commerce platform that offers a wide variety of goods to China's shoppers, including appliances, auto parts, and apparel, even though its roots are in food.
It was started to allow farmers to sell their fruits and vegetables, but its ongoing evolution has translated into 141% revenue growth in the first half of 2021. Analysts expect sales growth to cool to just a little more than 40% next year. But with some fiscal momentum working in its favor, per-share earnings are expected to swell from $0.10 this year to $0.78 in 2022.
Investors keeping tabs on Chinese stocks as a whole will know the country's regulators have been cracking down on most of its major technology companies, posing a risk to the bullish outlook. But if China's government was going to specifically target Pinduoduo any more than it already has indirectly, it arguably would have done so by now.

2021-11-19 00:00:00+00:00,What's Next For eBay's Stock?,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/whats-next-for-ebays-stock,,,"[11/17/2021] eBay Stock Update
At the current price of $74 eBayâs stock (NASDAQ: EBAY) seems to have limited upside potential as per Trefis analysis of eBayâs valuation. In Q3 2021 the company saw a slight fall in Gross merchandise volume by 10% y-o-y to $19.5 billion. Annual active buyers for the quarter declined by 5%, for a total of 154 million global active buyers. Meanwhile revenue was recorded at $2.5 billion, up at 11% y-o-y. 
We expect eBayâs revenues to rise by 7% to $11 billion for 2021, but net income to fall slightly to $2.4 billion for the year, decreasing its EPS figure to $3.47 in 2021. For FY 2022, we expect revenues to grow to $11.6 billion, increasing the EPS figure to $3.63, which coupled with the P/E multiple of 21.5x will lead to eBayâs valuation of $78, which is 5% above the current market price.
[08/26/2021] eBayâs Stock To Rise As Focus Continues On Core Business?
eBayâs stock (NASDAQ: EBAY) has seen a rise of 48% to $74 since the end of 2020 compared to  Trefisâ eBayâs valuation of $78. In comparison, the S&P 500 rose by 20% since the end of 2020. On June 24, 2021, the company announced it reached an agreement to sell 80.01% of its eBay Korea business to Emart for approximately $3 billion. They also completed the sale of classified business to Adevinta on June 24th for $13.3 billion, which included $2.5 billion in cash and approximately 540 million shares of Adevinta stock (44% ownership). The company further entered into an agreement to sell approximately 135 million shares of eBayâs Adevinta stock to Permira for over $2.4 billion, reducing their ownership of Adevinta to 33%. Hence, eBay continues its focus on simplifying their portfolio and concentrating on the core business. The company has continued to scale its management of payments globally, launching a new experience for sellers in all markets which saw migration of over 13 million sellers to the platform at the end of Q2 2021. The company recorded revenue of $2.7 billion, up 14% y-o-y for Q2 2021. We expect the company to continue its focus on the core business and think that the market has nearly priced in these developments. 
We expect eBayâs revenues to rise by 23% to $12.6 billion for 2021. Further, its net income is likely to increase to $2.6 billion, increasing its EPS figure to $3.73 in 2021. For FY 2022, we expect revenues to grow to $13.2 billion, increasing the EPS figure to $3.96 which coupled with the P/E multiple of 19.6x will lead to eBayâs valuation of $78, which is 5% above the current market price.
[07/06/2021] Will The Gains For eBayâs Stock Continue?
eBayâs stock (NASDAQ: EBAY) has seen a rise of 40% since the end of 2020 and as per Trefisâ valuation is now in line with its near term potential. In comparison, the S&P 500 rose by 16% since the end of 2020. Despite the coronavirus crisis, eBay saw its revenue and earnings rise in 2020 as there was an increasing shift toward online marketplaces compared to traditional brick and mortar stores. In FY 2020 the company registered a revenue growth of 19% y-o-y while earnings from continuing operations grew to $3.58 for the year compared to $1.79 in the previous year. The momentum continued in Q1 2021 as the company recorded revenue of $3.0 billion, up 42% y-o-y while Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV) was $27.5 billion, up 29% y-o-y. Further, annual active buyers grew by 7% y-o-y, to 187 million globally and annual active sellers grew by 8% y-o-y, to 20 million globally. We expect this momentum to continue for the year and think that the market has already priced in this growth. 
We expect eBayâs revenues to rise by 23% to $12.6 billion for 2021. Further, its net income is likely to increase to $2.6 billion, increasing its EPS figure to $3.73 in 2021, which coupled with the P/E multiple of 18.7x will lead to eBayâs valuation of $70, which is in line with the current market price.
[Updated 01/08/2021] Does eBayâs Stock Have More Than 20% Upside?
Having gained more than 43% in 2020, eBayâs stock (NASDAQ: EBAY) still has further growth potential of about 20% in the near term. EBAYâs stock has rallied from $36 to $52 in 2020 compared to the S&P 500 which moved 14% in the same period. The company has seen good revenue growth over recent years, while its P/S multiple has remained flat. We believe the stock, after the recent rally, still has potential for further growth. 
Due to the Covid-19 crisis, consumers have shifted toward online marketplaces, which benefited eBay as it saw its revenues rise by 10% in the first nine months of the year, compared to the same period in the previous year. In Q3 2020, eBay beat consensus estimates for revenue recorded at $2.6 billion, up 25% y-o-y and earnings recorded at $0.95 compared to $0.37 in the same period of the previous year. Further, the company reported $1.66 billion in cash inflows from operating activities for the first nine months. Trefis estimates Net Income to increase to $1.9 billion for 2020, increasing the EPS to $2.68. Thereafter, revenues are expected to grow to $11.9 billion in 2021. In addition, the EPS figure is likely to improve to $2.96, which coupled with the P/E multiple of around 21x will lead to eBayâs valuation of $63, up more than 20% from the current market price.
While EBAY stock is likely to move higher in the near term, there are several peers in its sector that look like a Better Bet Than EBAY Stock. Also eBay Peer Comparisons summarizes how the company fares against peers on metrics that matter.

See the 10 stocks
*Stock Advisor returns as of November 10, 2021
This video was recorded on Nov. 12, 2021.
Chris Hill: It's a Motley Fool Money radio show. I'm Chris Hill, joining me this week, senior analysts Andy Cross and Jason Moser. Good to see you as always gentlemen. We've got the latest headlines from Wall Street. We've got a conversation with best selling author Ben Mezrich and as always, we've got a couple of stocks on our radar. But for the second week in a row, we begin with the big macro. Consumer prices in the US rose more than six percent in October. This is the biggest surge and inflation in more than 30 years. Andy, inflation obviously affects us as consumers. How should we think about this news as investors?
Andy Cross: Yeah, Chris, you can go back to my Ann Arbor days and see inflation numbers like this back in the early '90s. I think this is one reason again, while we continue to see stocks doing so well over the last few months, not just because of the unlocking from the COVID pandemic. But I think really when investors are looking at places to put money and looking for returns, the fixed income market just continues to look less and less attractive to so many investors who are trying to save for retirement building nest-egg and I think that's just driven a lot of capital into the markets. You just think about like now if you're trying to buy a fixed instrument, even going out years and years, considering where inflation is today, you're just not going to make a good return on that instrument. Whether it's five-year or 30 years, long-term, short-term. I think investors are just saying, that's just not the place I want to be and so they're piling monies into stocks. We've seen stocks just continue, they pulled back a little bit this week, Chris. But for the past five weeks, they continue to march higher and higher. You still see the price-earnings ratio on the S&P 500 is still less than right around 20 so it's not unrealistic and it's still a place to put your money into and hopefully have a return of maybe mid to high single-digits over the next few years, probably you're not going to see the 12-15 percent per year we've seen over the last few years. But again, thinking about inflation and thinking about ways to be able to protect against that. The risk of inflation and not just this year, but may be higher than what we've seen over the last 10 years. Companies and stocks continue to be the most attractive opportunity for investors. Stocks and companies have pricing power, Chris, so they can fight off and inflation, but certainly better than fixed instruments can.
Chris Hill: But Jason, I'm assuming this doesn't change your feeling about stocks in general but does the inflation news maybe affect how you look at certain industries or certain classes of stocks?
Jason Moser: Yes, I think that's a good question. You're right. It, generally speaking, doesn't change the way I view investing, particularly in stocks. I've said before the correct response to inflation for investors is not to just stop investing. You want to keep investing. But I do think it's worth being a little bit pickier. Looking for those markets where you feel like companies they're selling those goods and services that people either need or really, really want. Companies with proven track records of pricing power over time. Those are the companies where I think investors should probably focus more attention during stretches like this. We'll get into Disney later on in the show here. But I think Disney's a very good example there but business is suffering right now in the near-term because of expenses, because of some inflationary pressures. But you can also argue that over time Disney does have some pricing power that they've been able to exercise. You start looking for some of those ideas where the market may be a little bit out-of-favor in the near term, but that could represent some long-term opportunity.
Andy Cross: It's interesting, Chris, you think about Jason mentioned different parts of the market and the concern a lot within increasing inflation, which leads to eventually increase in interest rates as the Fed at some point will start to increase interest rates are going to do their tapering probably quicker than what I think they originally had thought. But that increase in interest rate is bad news for tech for companies that are unprofitable because it stretches out, looking out years and years ahead, the interest rates are going to be much higher and that's going to hurt them. Yet I think those businesses are the ones that truly have much more flexibility because their cost structure is a little bit more variable and they might be able to show that profit increasing faster than what the market long-term expects. I continue to be excited about some of these innovative tech companies because of not just the markets they're serving, but the flexibility around their business models.
Chris Hill: From the big macro to the big split. On Friday, Johnson & Johnson announced plans to separate its consumer products business from the medical device and pharmaceutical divisions. This will happen in the next 18-24 months with a number of big decisions still to be made, including who's going to run that consumer products business, what it will be called, and how the transaction will affect current J&J shareholders. But on the surface, Jason separating the regulated parts of J&J's business from the over-the-counter products looks like a smart move.
Jason Moser: Yeah, I tend to agree. I certainly understand why they're doing this. I mean, when you look at the three main drivers of this business, and pharmaceuticals, medical devices, and consumer goods. The consumer goods side of the business doesn't seem to be quite as complementary, seems to be a little bit on its own there. When you look at the numbers, I mean the pharmaceutical and medical device parts of the company together. When you put those together, they're close to $20 billion of the company's $23.3 billion in sales they just reported. If you look at it on an annual basis and go back to 2019, just because I think 2020 isn't as helpful. Consumer goods represented 17 percent of total revenue for the company, but only 11.3 percent of operating profit, and it's not like it's growing breakneck speeds either. A lot of questions still to be answered here, you mentioned a few there. What are they going to call these companies or what are they going to call this new company? Who's going to be running the show? It does sound in regard to the transaction that's going to be done in a tax-efficient way for shareholders and they were very quick to state that the dividend policy will remain intact as well. I think that when you look at Johnson & Johnson as a whole and this is a really strong business. At the end of fiscal 2020, they reported 28 platforms or products with over one billion dollars in annual sales, and of those 28, 12 of those were two billion plus. A lot of that does come from the medical devices on the pharmaceutical side, but there are some really powerful brands in that families Listerine, Johnson's Baby, Tylenol. Those are some of the really strong brands that I think the business can continue to capitalize on, and splitting up might help them allocate resources that dictate strategy a little bit more efficiently.
Chris Hill: This week, Rivian Automotive went public in the biggest IPO since 2014. The maker of electric vehicles, none of which can be found on actual roads at the moment, priced its stock at $78, ended the week with the stock closing in on $130 a share with a market cap bigger than every automaker, not named Tesla. Andy, I know they have some big investors including Amazon and Ford Motor but come on.
Andy Cross: It was a big number, Chris. They raised $12-13 billion with about 153 million shares. They issued certainly this as we've seen with Tesla, you need a lot of capital for this business so they need the capital. Ford owns about 12 percent of the business, and I think Amazon owns maybe 18 or 19 percent of the business as well. The stock has actually been performing quite well over the last few months. I think it's up like 45 percent or so and I think a lot of that is because of the ownership of Rivian. As you mentioned, has yet to sell a car and focuses on really the pickup, that's their big push with their R1T all-electric pickup that comes with a 400 miles of range and on a single charge, also a whole all host of other things you can add into it like tents and flashlights and all kinds of fun things. Received about $10.5 billion of funding over the last few years from Amazon. Certainly, a lot of excitement that Rivian is really the next Tesla.
Like you mentioned, Chris, you can't find cars yet on the road or trucks yet on the road. They also have an SUV out there and they do have a pre-order of about 55,000 of their R1S's, which is the SUV and the R1T. Certainly, Amazon has been talking about committing with them and looking to be able to buy 100,000 electric delivery vans from Rivian over the next nine or 10 years. A lot of excitement around this, it certainly puts the spotlight on Rivian to deliver. It's pretty admirable what they're trying to do as they are trying to build these cars in a very eco-friendly way and run this business. But like you say, Chris, at $100 billion market cap without really any revenue yet there's a lot of expectations baked into the Rivian stock price.
Chris Hill: Shares of Disney down nearly 10% this week after a 3rd quarter report. It was highlighted by slowing growth for Disney Plus subscribers and Jason to be fair, it wasn't just streaming video. Profits and revenue also came in lower-than-expected.
Jason Moser: Well, first and foremost Chris, it's Friday, it's November 12th, so happy Disney Plus Day everybody.
Chris Hill: And to you and all who celebrate.
Jason Moser: [laughs] I think unless we've seen how powerful Amazon Prime Day can be. Let's see, if Disney can pull the same type of lever with Disney+ Day. We talk often, I think, about how great this business is, its wonderful qualities, the assets, the intellectual property; such an ongoing presence in so many lives. But it's not bulletproof and I think for Bob Chapek, the honeymoon is over and he's going to really need to start showing his medal here. They are suffering from a bit of a one-two punch here with signs of subscription business slowing a little bit and costs weighing down on the parks and experiences side. I certainly understand the near-term concerns there. Subscribers, those still look good. Disney Plus 118 million now, ESPN Plus is tread in water there. Hulu now 43.8 million subscribers. They've a total of 179 million and they are still on track. They believe for that 230-260 million Disney Plus subscriber target by the end of 2024 and getting that streaming business to profitability. But when you look at what really makes up this business today, parks and experiences, for the most par. You've got the entertainment side as well. Attendance looks good. Attendance continues to grow. You look at Walt Disney World, quarter 4 attendance was up double digits versus the quarter ago. Good sequential growth there. Disneyland continues to come back online as that reopening continues. Per capita spending up almost 30 percent versus 2019. Not 2020 but 2019, so I think that's very encouraging. There are a lot of questions today regarding the margin pressures. There are inflationary concerns as well as general investments in the business. We're seeing, of course, supply chain constraints, difficulties there. The consumer might be a little bit hesitant. These are things that are weighing on the business in the near term and they need to make sure that you get that traffic going because that really helps them realize that operating levels that they are so good with. You've got those fixed costs that it takes to keep us parks operating. The more guests, the better. It's understandable. The markets trepidation today, but I wouldn't count Disney out. [MUSIC]
Chris Hill: There was a big week for two stocks in particular. Details right after the break, so don't go anywhere. You're listening to Motley Fool Money. [MUSIC] Welcome back to Motley Fool Money. Chris Hill here with Jason Moser and Andy Cross. Third quarter revenue doubled for Roblox. Daily active users for the online game platform were also up and shares of Roblox rose more than 30 percent this week. Andy, you tell me, what stood out to you?
Andy Cross: Well, the bookings, Chris, which is the cashless transactions across their platform in any given quarter was up 28 percent, a little ahead of estimates. There's some nice growth there. Daily active users, as you mentioned, up 31 percent. Again, I think both those numbers combined showed that Roblox is not just going away as kids start to get outside and do other things. Some nice growth there. Highest in the Asia and Pacific with 75 percent growth on the user side and Asia-Pacific now 20 percent of all the users, which is nice. Hours engaged was up 28 percent. Again, right in that 20, high 20s, 30s growth rates I think are pretty attractive. Fifty percent of users now, Chris, are over the age of 13. That was up from 44, 45 percent a year ago. They talk a lot about this, expanding their opportunities to move just from kids much more into tweens. The developers and creators earned $130 million during the quarter. That was up 50 percent. They really spend a lot of time focused on the developers. Overall, when I look at Roblox, I own stock myself, they continue to make these investments which hurts the profitability although there's also some nice growth this year on the gross profits. But overall, they continue to make the investments. They're building up a network, expanding their brand opportunities, and I like what they're doing. David Baszucki, who is a very large shareholder, Founder, CEO, I like the direction he's taking the company.
Chris Hill: Shares of The Trade Desk up more than 40 percent this week after third quarter profits and revenue came in higher than expected. Jason, The Trade Desk was not exactly a cheap stock before and now, my goodness.
Jason Moser: [laughs] Now is a big week, big week for sure, but very understandable given the results. Stellar customer retention, which remained over 95 percent during the quarter as it has for the previous seven years. Then you look at the connected TV opportunity, particularly as ad-supported video on demand continues to take off. It's just a big market opportunity there. MoffettNathanson recently pegged that market, growing from $4.4 billion in 2020 to $18 billion by 2025. Remember, The Trade Desk provides a demand side platform that its customers used to purchase advertising space. It really is one of the businesses capitalizing on this opportunity in the biggest way. I think one of the most powerful quotes in the call was when CEO Jeff Green said, ""As we predicted, the most recent iOS changes have had no material impact on our business, and we expect that to remain the case."" If you're an advertising supported business and you can say that, that's really big because it's clearly been an issue for a lot of other businesses out there. Continued to grow support for that unified ID 2.0, focused on protecting privacy while using data in the most efficient way possible. All things considered, it's not a cheap-looking start, but it's a good business that is chasing a massive market opportunity. Good leadership. I'm a shareholder myself. I feel very good about it.
Chris Hill: Not everyone had a great week. Shares of Upstart Holdings fell more than 25 percent despite the fact that 3rd quarter revenue for the AI-lending platform was higher than analysts were expecting. Andy, Upstart Holdings is a growth company. Isn't this the type of quarter we want to see from a growth company?
Andy Cross: Well, it isn't as nice Chris, and their guidance for the year for the fourth quarter at 255 million to 265 million in revenue was ahead of estimates but it's a growth of 200 percent. I think they're starting to see a little bit of that taper down, which I think is natural. I think they're starting to see these some of the new clients that bringing into their platform, and they are bringing a lot of clients onto the platform. There's some expense to that. What they call the contribution profit is a little bit less than it was the previous quarter and also over last year. They continue to make these investments in the business. They continue to sign more and more banking partners on, banking partners expanded very rapidly this quarter. Overall, they're making the right investments. They're bringing a lot of people onto the platform. There is a cost to that. I think some of the investors were looking at that, the operating expenses growing 275 percent year over year and saying, ""Oh, wow, they are making those investments, the profitability may not be there"". I still like a lot of what they are doing. What Upstart is building in the business that are creating and long term, I think it looks still very attractive.
Chris Hill: Paypal's revenue in the 3rd quarter was lower than expected, and guidance for Q4 was not exactly what Wall Street was hoping for. Shares down nearly 10 percent this week. Jason, 2021 has not been great for PayPal shareholders. Is 2022 going to be better?
Jason Moser: I think so. Someone asked me about this on Twitter the other day and I said, look, they're going to push $1.25 trillion through their networks this year while finally putting eBay in the rear view mirror. If you can see the forest for the trees, I think the market is offering you get today. The shares now around 45 times full-year earnings. You're right, they guided down. That earnings per share number, they guided down slightly, revenue slightly as well. But I think most of that is due to headwinds from weaning themselves off of that eBay relationship there, we've been talking about that for the past year, knew that this was something that was going to be playing out for 2021. But when you look at the numbers themselves, total payment volume up 24 percent. If you exclude eBay, revenue grew 25 percent. They added 13.3 million new accounts. They now have 416 million active accounts using their services. Venmo now with more than 80 million customers in a $240 billion run rate in total payment volume. They inked a nice little relationships there with an up and comer. Chris, you may have heard of the a little company called Amazon?
Chris Hill: Yeah.
Jason Moser: Listen, I understand the market reacts the way it does when you pull back on guidance like that. But this remains a very good business, obviously leading the way in this fast developing fintech space. To me, this is one you have to own.
Chris Hill: All right, guys, we'll see you later in the show. Up next, the conversation with best-selling author Ben Mezrich. You're listening to Motley Fool Money. [MUSIC] Welcome back to Motley Fool Money. I'm Chris Hill. There's no question that one of the biggest investing headlines of 2021 is the story of GameStop (NYSE: GME) and Reddit. It's a tale wonderfully captured in Ben Mezrich's new book, The Antisocial Network, the GameStop Squeeze, and the Ragtag Group of Amateur Traders that Brought Wall Street to Its Knees. Mezrich has written multiple best-sellers, including The Accidental Billionaires, which was adapted into the Oscar-winning film, The Social Network. Recently, Motley Fool analyst, Maria Gallagher, talked with Ben Mezrich about the rise of meme stocks and how he decided to write this book through the lens of multiple investors.
Ben Mezrich: For the GameStop story, I know we were all familiar with the main characters, which was Roaring Kitty, which was the Melvin Capital people. I wanted to get inside the story from the perspective of people on Reddit who were buying GameStop. I wanted to tell it through the eyes of people that we would recognize, but also who did something interesting. There is a college kid who ended up turning a few thousand dollars investment into a quarter million dollars playing GameStop. Then there's a single mother of two who's just trying to make enough money to pay for her kid's braces. It was a matter of just trying to find people who we might identify with who got caught up in this craziness.
Maria Gallagher: In that vein, what would you say the biggest misconception the general public has about GameStop, WallStreetBets, what happened during this time?
Ben Mezrich: Sure. I think that people don't recognize how much of a movement it is and it was. The idea was it wasn't just people trying to make a few bucks out of short squeeze, it was people who were very angry about Wall Street and about being treated poorly going all the way back to 2008, but Occupy Wall Street with the banking crisis of that time. It was really sentiment-driven. But I also think another misconception is we have this image in our head of what the Reddit buyer looks like. We're picturing a nerdy white guy in a corner of a basement somewhere. The reality is it was a very diverse group of people on that Reddit board. It was people from all walks of life who really got involved in this. That's why I like to call it a revolution because I think it was much bigger than just a bunch of dudes in their basements trying to make a little bit of money. [laughs]
Maria Gallagher: I think it's really interesting too. You really highlight the sense of community that a lot of people found in this Reddit, in this WallStreetBets crowd, especially at a time during the pandemic when everyone was so physically isolated. Do you think that that played into the factor that sense of there was no real world that you could actually physically be in so people found this heightened sense of community online?
Ben Mezrich: Absolutely. I don't think this movement could have gotten to this point without the pandemic. It was really people trapped at home sitting on their couches and they had a little bit of money because of the stimulus checks, and no one had anything to do. You couldn't go out with friends, you couldn't do anything else, and so as a society, people were turning to things like Reddit, but also the stock market. The stock market was already being gamified and turned into a casino. But suddenly than were millions and millions of people just trapped and angry, [laughs] and not just at Wall Street, but at their lives. Everybody's lives got screwed up in such a big way and this was one way of making noise, of having a voice. I absolutely think it was pandemic-driven and with the book, I definitely tried to capture this moment in time.
Maria Gallagher: Something else that I thought was really interesting that you highlight too, is that interconnectedness, not only of the people on WallStreetBets, but within the structure of the back-end. You talk about the connections between Citadel, Melvin Capital, Robinhood. Can you explain a little bit for people who maybe aren't familiar about those relationships and how they impact us as retail investors since we're now all used to a no-commission trade? Can you explain a little bit about those dynamics?
Ben Mezrich: Sure, absolutely. It gets very complex, but I'm a layman and so if I can understand it, I think anybody can understand it. But the reality is these brokers like Robinhood that appear more and more and are getting bigger and bigger, really most retail traders used something like Robinhood. They don't charge you any fees and you don't have any minimum balances, but they don't actually make their money off of you. You're not actually their customer, you're their product. They make their money off of the market-makers, people like Citadel, who sit at the center of the US economy. When you buy a stock through Robinhood, it doesn't happen instantly. Although it looks like it happens instantly, like you buy some GameStop and it appears in your account, what's really happening is a two-day process where you put up a certain amount of money to buy GameStop, Robinhood takes your trades and then essentially sells them to Citadel, Citadel makes the trade happen.
This happens over a two-day period, which is called T+2 clearing. Then they get you the best deal possible and then they essentially pay Robinhood for all of these different trades. It's called payment for order flow. In the end, everyone is happy when it works well, because you get a good deal, you don't actually have to pay any commissions. Robinhood makes money on the trade, but doesn't have to charge you anything, and Citadel make tons of money because they are running all the trades and they can see what's going to happen, they can make money off of the trades and they make money by placing the trades, they get a little bit in between. That's essentially how the process works, but it's actually very ugly when you look at it from the perspective of who's making money off of who and who has incentives to do what. That's where it gets very murky when something like a giant short squeeze happens, and that's where all the drama comes from. But that's the connection. Citadel sits at the center of it, Robinhood is between us and them in a way, and then regular retail traders all use these brokerages to move their trades back and forth.
Maria Gallagher: I feel like that interconnection is so fascinating because you feel like you have Melvin Capital and you highlighted a lot in the book that people saying, specifically, we're going to take this hedge fund down. But then you also have in the back-end, Citadel who is going to come in and help or Citadel is making money from the fact that you're doing all of this. I think just that interconnection is something that people don't understand as well because it's so confusing and when it works, you don't really have to think about it. But then went something like this happens, it really highlights that kind of relationship that happens on the back-end. I'd be curious to think, where do you think we are in terms of WallStreetBets versus Wall Street in this story? Do you think hedge funds are prepared for this? Do you think this is going to really change anything as life turns back to normal? Where do you think we are in this story?
Ben Mezrich: I think this is the beginning of the story and I really think that what happened with GameStop is just the forerunner for a massive shift in how Wall Street works. You have hedge funds and they are the enemy to the retail trader in some way, and then you have the retail trader, which previous to this moment in time was very weak, it was lots of disparate people who are all doing their own things. The idea that they can move as one is something very new. The idea that social media allows millions and millions of retail traders to work together as if they're one giant hedge fund, they really can take down Wall Street. The idea is this Melvin Capital, which was this multi-billion dollar fund, got sideswiped, got forced into this horrible squeeze situation and lost half of the value of their firm because a whole bunch of people sitting on their couches were communicating with each other. What this does is it changes everything. The idea of the meme stock is really here to stay. The idea that a whole big group of people can decide that a stock is going to go up. Once they decide that, it will go up as long as they all hold together and don't sell it. The fundamentals of a company don't actually matter if there's a large group of people who decide to stocks should go up.
It doesn't really matter what GameStop does, what matters is what we feel about GME. This is similar to what's happening in crypto with Dogecoin, which is a ridiculous thing. There's no actual value to Dogecoin, but if we all decide it's worth something, then it's worth something. I do think we're going to see this again and again and again, and I do think the Wall Street on the whole is still not accepting or understanding the movement that's happening here. They are now employing people who are going to scour the Reddit boards and try and figure out which direction things are going, and they're definitely not going to announce short positions anymore, and they're going to be as quiet as they can about things like that. But on the whole, that's just a band-aid over what's going on. You're going to see giant swings like this again and again and again. I think it's going to be very hard to be careful in a market that can swing so rapidly. In a day, nine million people on WallStreetBets can decide to move a stock, and it's going to be very hard to react to that in general.
Maria Gallagher: That's really interesting. What do you think about that break from fundamentals? We have this prevailing method that the market is mostly rational. There are places where you can get gains because people aren't looking at what you are looking at. But in general, I think most investors would say, for the most part, the market acts rationally and there are times where you can exploit that irrationality. But for the most part, if you put your money in an index fund, you will do OK. Where do you think that that disconnect between the fundamentals of a business and the fundamental value of the stock market and then this idea that, well, we care about GME and if we're all going to do it, we're all going to raise it up. Do you think that they should maybe focus on companies with better fundamentals or do you think the whole point is that they're doing it for companies that are forgotten like AMC and GameStop?
Ben Mezrich: Yeah. I think that the rationality of the market is now in question. I think it's very hard to say that people are going to act rationally when you're talking about millions and millions of 22-year-olds, each with 1,000 dollars in the bank and each one wanting to make 10 times. Nobody is trying to make 10 percent on their money, everyone is trying to get 10X on their money. When you have a market full of people shooting for the moon, it's not going to be a rational market. I totally think that over time, it's going to get worse and worse and worse from one perspective. It's going to be more and more of people taking moonshots and trying to work together to make massive fortunes. You look at what happens, again, I go back to crypto and Bitcoin, and this is something that goes from a few thousand dollars to $50,000 in a year and people are still unhappy. They're saying when is it going to get to 100,000. That's not acting rationally. That's a need to make these giant YOLO trades, which is what we're going to see again and again. I don't think that Wall Street is going to be safe, it's not going to be a safe place to invest. I think the fundamentals are more and more going to be less and less important, and more and more important is going to be sentiment, nostalgia. The idea that AMC, we love movie theaters, so we're all going to grab AMC and hold onto it, and the idea that someone would short AMC is almost offensive. Even though it might make financial sense to short AMC. People are going to be very upset at that maneuver. I think sentiment is really going to guide market.
Maria Gallagher: Interesting. Yeah, I wonder where that's going to, whether it is going to be ever maybe some balance between you have this small fringe and then mainstream. What would be your opinion on the gamification of investing? When we think about Robinhood, you highlighted in the book as well, that rush when people got confetti on their first trade and the rush of dopamine when you make a trade and really having it resemble gambling. The slot machines and the fun colors in that interest. Do you think that that's a good thing because you're getting people more interested in, we might say bad investing? Or do you think it's actually ending up doing more harm because people are not thinking, let me try and get 10 percent because I can build up a nest egg for the rest of my life. They're looking like let me get 10X in the next five minutes.
Ben Mezrich: Yeah. I think Robinhood is a wonderful app. I like it, everyone likes it, but it really is pushing us toward turning it all to a giant casino with a video game console to it. Everyone is becoming a gambler. College kids that used to gamble on sports are gambling on the stock market now. Average people are now looking at their portfolio as a gambler looks at a portfolio not as someone who is trying to make a few percentage points. I do think the gamification of Wall Street. Let's be fair. It was always a game. But now everyone gets to play. Suddenly, it's not just people in seats and ties on Wall Street playing, it's everyone can join in on this game, but it is a game and it is gambling to some extent. I think overall, this may be negative. The idea of democratizing finance is very good and you want more and more people to be in the market. But people aren't coming with the level of education. They're not coming with knowledge of how the market works. They're coming with, I'm going to hit a home run, I'm going to buy game stock it's going to go to 500.
That's where it starts to get dangerous. I think it's great that more and more people are trading. I think what Robinhood represents, it's something great. The ability to be a trader without actually having to spend years learning how to do it. But there's no warnings. There's not enough warnings. I think that it's dangerous without a certain level of education and understanding. I've always been intrigued by the idea of risks and what people's personal risk is. The reality is someone with very little money and no real nest egg or anything like that is risking a whole lot more than some Wall Street trader. A Wall Street trader loses on a trade and they get up the next morning and they start again. But if you lose your rent money, you don't get up and start again the next day. I think there's not an equitable amount of risk. When you democratize finance to everyone, there is a lot of people who are taking enormous risks with their lives, and not really realizing it.
Chris Hill: The book is the Antisocial Network, The GameStop Squeeze and the Ragtag Group of Amateur Traders that brought Wall Street to Its Knees. You can find it wherever you find books. But up next Jason Moser and Andy Cross are coming back with a couple of stocks on their radar. Stay right here, you're listening to Motley Fool Money. As there are always people on the program who may have interest in the stocks they talk about and The Motley Fool may have formal recommendations for or against. So don't buy or sell stocks based solely on what you hear. Welcome back to Motley Fool Money. Chris Hill here once again with Andy Cross and Jason Moser. Before we get to radar stocks guys, Arby's may have the meat, but now they also have the vodka. Starting next week for a limited time, Arby's vodka will be available for $60 a bottle. It will come in two flavors, curly fry and crinkle fry. Jason Moser, if you want a little spice in your vodka, good news.
Jason Moser: Well, I don't really drink a whole lot of vodka and I don't know that this makes me want to really start. But I understand we are in a day and age where brands, particularly these quick-service brands, need to branch out and capitalize on their brand to whatever extent that they can. It feels like, and I'd love that Mac has a great phrase for this, the brand permission and Mac, I agree with you. I just don't think that Arby's has the brand permission here to pull this off, but I guess we'll see.
Andy Cross: I do like myself a little Bloody Mary Chris, and so maybe a little spice in a Bloody Mary with some vodka. That might do it.
Jason Moser: I feel like it's better with the jamocha shake. To me, that's what Arby's does so well. The fries are good, don't get me wrong, but it just, it feels like the jamocha shake vodka combo makes more sense than the fries. But the fries thing is definitely an attention-getter.
Chris Hill: Let's get to the stocks on our radar, our man behind the glass, Rick Engdahl is going to hit you with a question. Andy, you're up first, what are you looking at this week?
Andy Cross: Rick, Chris, I'm looking at Sea Limited symbol SE, $184 billion e-commerce gaming entertainment company that focuses mostly in our emerging markets, including Asia and Latin America. It's gaming business is really the driver of a lot of the growth. It's one of the largest gaming developers and publishers across 130 countries. Free Fire is the biggest gain. It's a mobile battle royale game that was the most downloaded game over the last year. Half its revenues come from gaming, but it's also really growing out its e-commerce business called Shopee. Also its payments business, which is really exciting as they merge those two together. When you look at the e-commerce market overall, Rick and I look at the growth picture growing north of 100 percent, continuing to grow very, very attractive in those markets, it's going to do about nine billion in sales, about 15 times multiple. I don't think that's too expensive. I'm still not making money, but a lot of growth baked into the price and I think it could be worth it.
Chris Hill: Rick, question about Sea Limited.
Rick Engdahl: Yeah. I've heard Sea Limited referred to as the Amazon of Asia, and I'm just wondering the obvious question, do they have a space program? Are they sending celebrities to space because?
Andy Cross: I don't think so Rick, this is like that Amazon, MercadoLibre, Activision Blizzard all kind of merged together. I don't yet see this space picture yet.
Chris Hill: Jason Moser, what are you looking at?
Jason Moser: Yeah. Taking a look at Unity Software ticker. Unity reported their earnings earlier this week, it's interesting to see how the stock was selling off after hours only to finish up strongly the next day. It's actually a great week with shares up better than 20 percent. But I understand why. I mean, they grew revenue by 43 percent, beat their internal guidance handily. Now, with 973 customers each generating more than $100,000 in revenue over the last year versus 739 a year ago. I think the big news they are acquiring visual effects company, Weta Digital, best known, I think for a lot of the stuff that you've seen in movies in the Lord of the Rings franchise. But that's going to bring a lot of talent, tools and assets under their umbrella that will enable creators around the world to continue building using Unity well beyond just games. I think they're doing a very good job of continuing to build out to other verticals, which is really the encouraging part of the story.
Chris Hill: Rick, question about Unity Software?
Rick Engdahl: Sure, Jason, you are a parent, I'm a parent. Certainly to get our kids off of playing games and into creating games with this is our MasterClass for Unity or something?
Jason Moser: Yeah. [laughs] I like that mindset. We're not a big gaming household and so consequently, my girls aren't big gamers, but you're thinking of it the right way and maybe it's just a matter of getting them invested earlier and teaching them about how these businesses work. Because yeah, it's like giving him a fish versus teaching him how to fish. Let's teach him how to fish. [laughs]
Chris Hill: What do you want to add, Rick?
Rick Engdahl: Well, full disclosure. I actually own a little bit of both of these, but perhaps Unity's more fun right now.
Chris Hill: We're out of time. We'll see everybody next week.

2021-11-17 00:00:00+00:00,Is Coupang Stock a Buy?,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/is-coupang-stock-a-buy,,,"Coupang's (NYSE: CPNG) stock sank 9% on Nov. 12 after the South Korean e-commerce leader posted its third-quarter results.
Its revenue increased 48% year over year to $4.6 billion but missed estimates by $200 million. Its net loss widened from $173 million to $324 million, or $0.19 per share, which also missed expectations by a penny.
On an adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) basis, Coupang's net loss still widened from $177 million to $207 million. Those headline numbers look ugly, but could Coupang's stock be worth buying as it languishes far below its IPO price of $35?
Don't call it the ""Amazon of South Korea""
Coupang is frequently called the ""Amazon of South Korea"" because it's the country's e-commerce leader. It also generates most of its sales from its first-party marketplace, its expanding its ecosystem with new features like grocery delivery services and streaming videos, and it offers a Prime-like subscription service called Rocket WOW.
Image source: Getty Images.
But Coupang is also different from Amazon in two major ways. First, Amazon accounted for 40% of the U.S. e-commerce market this year, according to eMarketer, while the rest of its rivals hold single-digit shares. Coupang's lead is a lot narrower: it controlled 25% of South Korea's e-commerce market in 2020, according to Goodwater Capital, while its closest rival, eBay's Gmarket, still held a 20% share.
Second, Amazon is consistently profitable because its cloud platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS), operates at much higher margins than its retail business. Coupang doesn't own a comparable profit engine, yet it continues to sacrifice its margins for growth by investing in lower-margin and loss-leading services.
Decelerating growth in a post-pandemic market
Coupang's revenue skyrocketed 93% in 2020, as its number of active customers increased 26% to 14.85 million throughout the pandemic. The expansion of its logistics network, which placed fulfillment centers within seven miles of roughly 70% of the South Korean population, also paid off and enabled Coupang to fulfill most of its deliveries within a single day.
But over the past year, its year-over-year revenue growth decelerated as more businesses reopened. Its total number of active customers also dipped sequentially in the third quarter, but it partly offset that slowdown by increasing its net revenues per active customer:

Coupang's gross margin expanded sequentially in the third quarter, but mainly because it faced an easy comparison to a warehouse fire in the second quarter. Excluding the impact of that fire, Coupang would have posted a gross margin of 18.2% in the second quarter -- so its gross margins are still gradually shrinking as its adjusted EBITDA and net losses widen.
During the conference call, Coupang CFO Gaurav Anand attributed that pressure to higher COVID-19 costs, labor expenses, and investments, but said that as the company would move ""past these short-term headwinds"" and ""unlock meaningful margin expansion"" as its scale improves.
But Coupang's declining gross margins are still troubling, because they suggest it doesn't have enough pricing power or scale in the South Korean market yet. It plans to boost its gross margins by aggressively expanding its third-party marketplace and advertising businesses, but those strategies could backfire and cause lower-quality goods to seep into its marketplace.
As for its overseas expansion, which the company has repeatedly highlighted as a major catalyst for its long-term growth, CEO Bom Kim said those efforts remained in a ""nascent stage"" during the conference call.
Coupang still held $3.93 billion in cash and equivalents at the end of the third quarter -- so it can afford to remain unprofitable as it ramps up its investments and overseas experiments -- but it eventually will need to stop the bleeding.
Coupang's valuations will remain depressed
Analysts expect Coupang's revenue to rise 54% this year and 39% next year. Based on those expectations, Coupang's stock looks very cheap at 1.8 times next year's sales. Amazon, which is growing at a much slower rate, trades at 3.2 times next year's sales.
However, Coupang's valuations will likely remain depressed until its revenue growth, gross margins, and net losses stabilize. It also needs to stop losing active customers on a sequential basis.
Coupang's stock is worth accumulating at these levels, since the stock is undeniably cheap and has a lot of growth potential, but investors should fully understand the risks and realize it could be a very bumpy ride.

2021-11-16 00:00:00+00:00,13 Consumer Stocks for the Holiday Season,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/13-consumer-stocks-for-the-holiday-season,,,"When it comes to consumer stocks, the November-through-December holiday shopping period is crucial to their success. 
And amid supply-chain disruptions and staffing shortages at many companies, it is increasingly clear that only the best retail stocks will have what it takes to navigate the challenging environment in the weeks ahead.
But while the headlines may be offering a Grinch-like feel lately for some retailers, the fact is that there is a select group of consumer stocks that are actually firing on all cylinders and looking eagerly ahead to the final weeks of the year. 
With that in mind, here are 13 of the best consumer stocks to buy for the upcoming holiday season. 
Many of these stocks have significantly outperformed the S&P 500 already, with either big jumps after recent earnings reports or a continued grind higher that has put their shares at or near new highs. And all of them have a lot to offer investors and should be ones to explore if you're looking for outperformance in the final months of 2021. (We also have you covered if you prefer online retail ETFs for the holiday season.)

Abercrombie & Fitch
Market value: $2.7 billion
Dividend yield: N/A
Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF, $46.16) is a retailer that was once a force to be reckoned with at American malls and high school lunchrooms.
The stock went from more than $80 per share before the 2008 financial crisis to less than $20 a share by early 2009. And though shares partially recovered as the dust settled, the bigger problem ANF faced wasn't the economic downturn but the pressures of e-commerce and changing consumer tastes.
So after a slow bleed for several years and the resulting pain of the pandemic, by late 2020, ANF stock was even lower than it had been back in 2009.
But a funny thing has happened: The brand's slow transformation that began 10 years ago in the wake of the financial crisis was kicked into high gear through this latest disruption caused by COVID-19. The result is that the prior year's loss is not just on pace to be fully erased this fiscal year but turned into a massive profit of $4.49 per share â more than the tally of all its per-share earnings since 2014 combined.
Investors bid shares up more than 15% over a two-day time span this spring as the substance of its recovery started to become clear to Wall Street following the retailer's first-quarter earnings report.
And since then, the company has made continued improvements to its operations to ensure this is not a flash in the pan. In late October, for instance, ANF announced same-day delivery plans and a major logistics hub investment in the Phoenix area to ensure it has the right infrastructure to compete digitally in both the holiday season and in years to come.

Bath & Body Works
Market value: $19.8 billion
Dividend yield: 0.8%
Earlier this year, the company formerly known as L Brands spun off its women's wear into the separate Victoria's Secret (VSCO) firm and renamed itself Bath & Body Works (BBWI, $74.81). BBWI will focus on home and body care products under brands including Bath & Body Works, White Barn, C.O. Bigelow and others.
The idea was to rejuvenate this business by separating it from the apparel-focused VSCO and capitalize on a recent shift to ""self-care"" among consumers that has led to strong spending in the toiletries, fragrance and soaps category.
Admittedly, it's always hard to tell how such a transformation is transpiring without a few years of financials instead of just a few quarters. But in the wake of the spinoff, BBWI has been doing well enough to be worthy of notice. 
Specifically, in its second-quarter report back in August, it gapped up more than 10% in a single session after posting a massive 43% surge in sales and a significant profit after a quarterly loss in the year-ago period. This was a record quarter that blew away expectations, and was a clear sign Bath & Body Works is on the track to long-term success in the wake of this restructuring.
Looking forward, things will settle down and analysts are only projecting about 7% revenue growth next fiscal year. And without Victoria's Secret, there will be a lot more attention and a lot fewer excuses as time goes by. 
Still, as far as consumer stocks go, the big uptrend in this one hints that Wall Street isn't expecting this turnaround story to fall flat anytime soon. Shares of BBWI are up more than 170% in the last 12 months, with no sign of slowing down as we enter the holiday shopping season.

Boot Barn Holdings
Market value: $3.6 billion
Dividend yield: N/A
Not familiar with the $3.6 billion ""lifestyle retail"" chain Boot Barn Holdings (BOOT, $121.11)? If you live in a coastal or urban area that's probably not a surprise, as the company specializes in Western-style footwear and apparel ranging from chunky belt buckles to cowboy boots to denim.
Though admittedly a niche store, the roughly 280 Boot Barn stores across 36 states serve a very lucrative segment of the U.S. retail industry. Consider some of its premium boots sell for $2,500 a pair, and iconic Stetson cowboy hats can sell for even more. Those products may not carry the same weight in Paris as they do on the prairie, but that doesn't mean there aren't plenty of customers willing to open their wallets up wide at Boot Barn all the same.
And lately, consumers are headed to BOOT in droves with a willingness to spend big time. In the current fiscal year, for instance, revenue is forecast to surge more than 50% from about $890 million last year to $1.35 billion. Earnings per share are set to explode nearly 160% on top of that, from $2.01 to a projected $5.21. No wonder shares have more than tripled in the last calendar year and are setting new 52-week highs like clockwork â  making it one of the best consumer stocks out there.
Though some Wall Streeters may not be willing to spend hundreds or thousands of bucks on country fashion stylings, there's no doubt that much of America disagrees based on this performance. And as luxury retail sales tend to be much more durable than low-end transactions, where middle-class and working-class consumers are quick to pull back in tough times, there's a good chance that Boot Barn stock is just getting started with its recent success.

Crocs
Market value: $10.4 billion
Dividend yield: N/A
At first blush you may think that Crocs (CROX, $177.50) is just that quirky company that was a big-time fad a decade ago but almost went bust in the wake of the financial crisis. While that may be true, it misses out on the very important rejuvenation of the shoemaker in recent years
Case in point: In early 2021, CROX eclipsed its prior all-time high set way back in 2007, and has continued to set new 52-week highs over the last few months.
If you want reasons for this surge in CROX stock, look no farther than the fundamentals. In the current year, Crocs is expected to book a 65% revenue increase over fiscal 2020. And lest you think that's fueled only by a short-term rebound from pandemic lows, the company is projecting more than 20% growth next year on top of that. 
From a profit perspective, things look equally impressive, with earnings per share expected to rise more than 135% from $3.22 last year to an estimated $7.59 this year â then forecast to rise another 21% to $9.18 in fiscal 2022.
When it comes to retail stocks, the strength of this one comes from its direct-to-consumer push that allows it to maintain impressive margins, as well as its continued expansion into new geographies and new products. And while its signature colorful clogs still represent the lion's share of revenue, management is pushing hard to diversify â and grow â beyond this already impressive product line.

Dick's Sporting Goods
Market value: $11.6 billion
Dividend yield: 1.3%
The typical story for most consumer stocks lately seems to be the lingering impact of a sales bust during the pandemic and a struggle to right themselves as the economy normalizes. But Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS, $134.44) is decidedly different, with a lot of success to speak of despite challenges for its peers.
DKS operates a fiscal year ahead of the calendar year, so the fact that its 2021 revenue was up almost 10% during the disruptions of calendar 2020 is a huge win for the company. Furthermore, projections for the current fiscal year of 2022 show Dick's accelerating even more, with projected 23% revenue expansion and profits set to roughly double over the prior year.
The reasons for this are multifaceted. Firstly, Dick's benefits from being in a retail segment that thrived during the pandemic as folks looked to get outdoors and loaded up on gear like hiking boots and golf equipment to do so. 
Secondly, Dick's had already invested in its ""omnichannel"" operations that allow people to book sales online and either have items delivered to their home or picked up the same day in stores. 
And last but not least, this short-term tailwind is proving durable as total e-commerce remains at nearly 20% of total revenue even after the instant pandemic-driven bump â and likely will grow further in the coming years as this shift in consumer behavior becomes widespread and permanent for.
With a dominant presence in the sport goods category, a segment of retail that is sometimes more insulated from e-commerce competition as shoppers like to try on athletic wear or feel the heft of a softball bat in person, Dick's is a stock to watch this all-important holiday season.

Dillard's
Market value: $6.8 billion
Dividend yield: 0.2%
For those unfamiliar with Arkansas-based Dillard's (DDS, $342.13), the company was founded in the 1930s and operates roughly 300 retail department stores in the South and Midwest.
Admittedly, it's not the kind of business that has done particularly well lately amid the rise of e-commerce and recent coronavirus disruptions. For instance, evenue had already stagnated, fading slightly from $6.4 billion in fiscal 2017 to $6.3 billion in fiscal 2020, before taking a sharp dive to $4.4 billion in fiscal 2021 that ended in January of this year. That is decidedly bad news for any publicly traded stock and DDS stock took a big hit as a result.
So why is Dillard's on this list of best consumer stocks?
Well, things have stabilized lately now that the economy is opening up again and both investors and Dillard's management team have been forced to reset their expectations after shares plummeted from around $140 at their mid-2015 highs to a pandemic-era low in the $20 range. Now, shares have surged up above $350 on hopes that the company is finally on the right track â and just in time for an important holiday shopping season.
Analysts are expecting Dillard's to swing to a huge profit after last year's operating loss, and see top-line revenue surging to $6.5 billion if projections hold. 
It's out of the norm to expect a largely brick-and-mortar company like DDS to emerge from the pandemic actually stronger than when it went in, but the crisis forced store closures and a focus on higher margins that has helped transform this otherwise old-school stock.

Ebay.com
eBay
Market value: $46.5 billion
Dividend yield: 1.0%
An old favorite among e-commerce bulls, eBay (EBAY, $74.21) is much more than just the online auction site that it used to be way back in the late 1990s. Its platforms do still support the garage-sale crowd and bargain hunters, but they also support direct retailers, liquidators, wholesales, import and export companies and much more.
Despite an already impressive scale with $10 billion in annual sales across these channels, eBay continues to enjoy incremental revenue growth. But what's really impressive isn't the single-digit sales expansion but the massive profitability it sees as third-party buyers and sellers do most of the work. For instance, earnings per share are set to expand 16% this fiscal year and another 14% in fiscal 2022. This growth adds to the brisk performance of eBay in 2020 that was driven by stuck-at-home shoppers during the pandemic.
The reason for this success is deceptively simple: EBAY is building on its historic roots to offer a smaller and more personalized feel, catering to collectors and hobbyists and specialists in a way that behemoths like Amazon.com (AMZN) or Alibaba Group (BABA) either can't or won't. 
Consider its recent push into factory-refurbished products, where it offers a warranty and curated experience to build confidence among consumers as it offers deals. In this age where fake products and fake reviews abound on many major e-commerce portals, this is a great idea. 
Additionally, EBAY has deployed its specialized auction know-how to enter heavy-equipment resales via a strategic partnership with Bidadoo. The used heavy machinery market in the U.S. is estimated to be between $50 billion and $60 billion.
Sure, eBay may never be able to convince shoppers it is the go-to place for a new 4K TV or books or sneakers. But catering to bargain-conscience shoppers looking for quality used products or niche goods? That's in this Silicon Valley icon's DNA â and in 2021, this strategy is not just fending off Amazon, but helping eBay continue to build on its past successes as one of the best retail stocks around.

Newegg Commerce
Market value: $7.1 billion
Dividend yield: N/A
Newegg Commerce (NEGG, $19.21) has roughly $7 billion in market value and is one of the founding fathers of the ""build your own PC"" movement. NEGG has been around since 2001 selling computer components and other consumer tech hardware via its e-commerce platform. Thanks to a strong brand and loyal customers, the company has managed to expand over the years into a truly global e-tailer that serves the U.S., Europe, South America and Asia.
You may think there's no place for PCs in a mobile age, but the truth is that devices have simply become more specialized. 
There are your typical mobile devices, the mundane laptops standard at the workplace and school, and then ""everything else"" that requires a computer. Newegg thrives in this latter category by providing high-quality video cards to serious gamers and graphic designers, studio quality hardware for audiophiles and musicians and all the custom memory and performance solutions that tech-savvy people want to upgrade above the typical run-of-the-mill Dell machine.
Needless to say, the COVID-induced work-from-home craze and the supercharged gig economy have benefited Newegg thanks to its specialization. 
In August, NEGG reported that it had seen a 40% year-over-year increase in net sales and a 14% rise in the first half of the year â proving this tech retailer hasn't slowed in 2021. While supply-chain disruptions remain a challenge for consumer stocks as we enter the final months of the year, NEGG seems to be navigating the waters just fine.

Overstock.com
Overstock.com
Market value: $4.6 billion
Dividend yield: N/A
While some consumers may only know the $4.6-billion e-commerce portal Overstock.com (OSTK, $106.89) as an online discounter, more active traders will know that this company has been a pretty volatile and quirky investment over the last few years. Consider it went from a 2017 high of almost $80 a share to less than $7 a share by late 2019 as it struggled to turn a profit and faced anemic sales growth when compared with other online competitors.
Or more recently, Overstock introduced a ""digital dividend"" in 2020 as part of its big push into the cryptocurrency and blockchain arena. Shareholders were given one digital share of the OSTKO blockchain-based security token for every 10 shares of common stock they held.
Some of that volatility admittedly remains. However, after Overstock announced in January that its blockchain-focused subsidiary Medici Ventures will be spun out on its own into a limited partnership fund, pending legal and regulatory approval, it appears less of the crypto-related hype will pervade the stock. 
And with its core e-commerce engine doing pretty well right now, this could be the moment OSTK gets its groove back as one of the go-to retail stocks in a digital age.
In both the current fiscal year and the next one, revenue for Overstock.com is expected to grow at least 11%. And earnings per share are projected to almost double in fiscal 2021 before tacking on an additional 25% in growth in fiscal 2022. This gives some strong fundamentals to back up the recent narrative of success.
It's not uncommon to still see big swings in OSTK stock, but lately the moves have been higher. Thanks to a strong push after the company reported higher-than-expected third-quarter EPS at the end of October, shares are now trading at levels not seen since August 2020.
If the momentum keeps up, it could be off to the races for Overstock as we close out the year and enter 2022.

Revolve Group
Market value: $6.1 billion
Dividend yield: N/A
Revolve Group (RVLV, $83.48) is an online fashion retailer known for its FWRD e-commerce portal as well as its namesake Revolve brand. It operates a global platform that brings in emerging and established third-party brands as well its own in-house clothing.
Surf the Revolve websites and it's clear right away the kind of consumer it is catering to â young, female and willing to spend big bucks. And one thing that has always proven durable in any economic environment is the enthusiasm of young, affluent women to spend freely on the latest fashions. 
What's interesting about RVLV, however, is that it has forgone the typical brick-and-mortar approach of established luxury fashion stores and has scaled up quickly with its online-only approach. This has allowed for a host of benefits, including better margins and the potential to compete both on price and availability. Given its structure, Revolve can stock a much wider array of fashions from a diverse cast of designers to ensure it is always en vogue.
The success of this strategy shows up in the numbers, with revenue set to jump more than 50% this fiscal year and another 22% next year. Profits are also ticking steadily higher, set to rise 32% from 79 cents in earnings per share in fiscal 2020 to $1.04 per share this year. And for fiscal 2022, earnings are projected to rise another 15% to $1.23 per share, according to recent forecasts.
Fashion is fickle, but the agile and digital-friendly model of Revolve seems to be connecting big with consumers right now. And based on recent share performance, with RVLV stock up more than 300% in the last 12 months, Wall Street seems confident this is one of the best retail stocks to believe in this holiday season.

Signet Jewelers
Market value: $5.4 billion
Dividend yield: 0.7%
Consumers will recognize many of the nameplates operating under the Signet Jewelers (SIG, $101.65) corporate parent, including Kay Jewelers, Jared, Zales and Piercing Pagoda to name a few.
The luxury goods sector is very much dependent on consumer spending trends, and this could portend good things for SIG given wealthy and COVID-weary shoppers are even more eager to spend than before. It also doesn't hurt that all those delayed weddings and engagements due social distancing has resulted in a nice tailwind for 2021 ring sales.
As prelude to what may be in store during the holiday season, Signet's quarterly earnings report in September topped expectations and sparked a 6% run in a single day after strong numbers and encouraging forward guidance. Specifically, that report was for the company's second-quarter of fiscal 2022 and featured news that sales more than doubled year-over-year and SIG raised its full-year same-store-sales guidance to 30% to 33% expansion compared with prior forecasts of 24% to 27% growth.
Certain consumer stocks are facing uncertainty right now because of supply-chain issues or pricing pressures, but the jewelry business is largely insulated from these trends. In fact, some consumers are drawn to gold, platinum and diamonds in inflationary environments because of the potential that these materials will actually be worth more in the long run. All of these trends add up to what looks like a strong chance of success for SIG in the weeks ahead.

Tempur Sealy International
Market value: $8.7 billion
Dividend yield: 0.8%
When people started spending more time at home because of the pandemic, one of the first things they did was evaluate the furniture they were spending more time around. And since most people spend a third or more of their life in bed, it's no surprise that Tempur Sealy International (TPX, $45.19) was one of the companies that benefited from this trend. The firm has a broad array of bedding and mattress brands including Sleep Outfitters, Tempur-Pedic, Sealy, Comfort Revolution and Stearns & Foster.
But in 2021, TPX is decidedly not a story about people laying in bed during the gloomy days of the pandemic. Case in point: In July, Tempur Sealy stock popped roughly 15% in a single session back in July thanks to a standout earnings report. Specifically, TPX said operating income jumped 318% over Q2 2020 and hiked its quarterly dividend 29% to ensure shareholders got their piece of that strong performance. 
Temper Sealy's third-quarter numbers weren't quite as jaw-dropping, but featured a 20% year-over-year sales bump and a 39% increase in net income to show the stock is still going very strong.
Shares have risen almost 70% so far this year on a solid performance. And while there is certainly no shortage of mattress-by-mail competitors, this year-to-date return is plenty of proof that TPX is fending them off with its broad distribution network and doorstep delivery that allows folks to try its products without ever setting foot into a store.
With shares hitting new all-time highs after this recent run, investors have good reason to think that TPX stock will stay strong through the holiday season.

Williams-Sonoma
Market value: $15.8 billion
Dividend yield: 1.3%
Williams-Sonoma (WSM, $212.00) is the operator of a few dominant upscale houseware brands, including the Pottery Barn, West Elm and its Williams-Sonoma namesake among others. And thanks to the ""nesting"" trend prompted by the pandemic and the rise of semi-permanent telework, luxury furniture and kitchenware has been a tremendous segment to be in lately.
But the appeal of WSM goes beyond its niche or short-term trends. The retailer invested years ago in a multi-platform sales approach that included same-day online purchasing and in-store pickups well before COVID-19 prompted its competitors to play catch up.
Another big plus: Unlike cash-strapped competitors, WSM opted to pay brick-and-mortar staff across pandemic-related closures in 2020. This helped its loyal cashiers and warehouse staff remain on the payroll and be ready to ramp up operations this holiday season. 
And it recently doubled down on investing in its rank and file by increasing its minimum wage to $15 an hour, too. That kind of compassionate corporate culture is increasingly in demand among managers and senior staff and will pay dividends for this company for years to come as it retains and attracts talent beyond those just stocking shelves this December.
The icing on the cake is that all this news and narrative is only the tip of the iceberg. The real heft of WSM stock comes in its numbers, with current fiscal year profits set to hit $13.60 per share â up 50% from the $9.04 per share it earned the year prior â with revenue set to spike 20%. 
Share momentum is equally impressive, with new 52-week highs being set like clockwork and WSM sitting on a 117.3% gain for the year-to-date.
With a combination of strong management, impressive growth and a solid niche within retail, this is one of the best consumer stocks that could continue to knock it out of the park in the coming months.

2021-11-16 00:00:00+00:00,Software firm Blue Prism gets $1.6 bln takeover offer from U.S.-based SS&C,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/software-firm-blue-prism-gets-%241.6-bln-takeover-offer-from-u.s.-based-ssc,,,"Adds details on SS&C offer, background on Vista deal
Nov 16 (Reuters) - British software firm Blue Prism PRSMB.L said on Tuesday it received a preliminary buyout proposal from U.S.-based SS&C Technologies Holdings SSNC.O for 1.16 billion pounds ($1.56 billion), months after it had agreed to a smaller deal.
London-listed Blue Prism's shares jumped roughly 10% to 1,239 pence on the 1,200 pence per share offer from SS&C.
Blue Prism, whose customers include automaker Daimler DAIGn.DE, e-commerce firm eBay EBAY.O and Britain's NHS, in September agreed to be taken private by U.S. private equity firm Vista Equity for 1.09 billion pounds.
The British firm said it was providing SS&C with due diligence access equal to that given to Vista, adding that it continued to back the Vista deal and would not withdraw its recommendation that shareholders vote in its favour.
Blue Prism also postponed its general meeting that was scheduled for Nov. 19 as it evaluated SS&C's offer along with its advisers, adding that a firm offer from SS&C was not guaranteed.

This video was recorded on Nov. 9, 2021.
Chris Hill: It's Tuesday, November 9th, and welcome to Market Foolery. I'm Chris Hill. With me today, the one and only Bill Mann. Thanks for being here.
Bill Mann: How are you, brother?
Chris Hill: I'm doing all right. We've got Roblox shooting to the moon, and PayPal falling from the sky, but we have to start.
Bill Mann: Halt be the right word. [laughs]
Chris Hill: Exactly. They're adding an outlet there now, PayPal. We will get to that. We have to start with what I can only describe as the end of an era. When the Dow Jones Industrial Average was formed in 1896, General Electric was one of the original 12 companies in the average, and it was there, stayed there for well over a century until it was replaced by Walgreens in 2018. This morning, CEO Larry Culp announced that GE is going to split into three separate companies. The healthcare unit is going to be spun-off in early 2023, the energy division will be spun-off in early 2024, and the aviation business will be the remaining company. Before we get to the underlying businesses, and what this means for GE shareholders and potential shareholders, because the stock is up on this news, I'm curious how you felt when you saw this news, because I felt, even though I have never owned shares of GE, I never seriously thought about owning shares of GE. I did feel a twitch of melancholy.
Bill Mann: I felt a little bit sad. General Electric Company is about to become three more specific electric companies. We will see what they do with the names. Apparently, the aircraft division will retain General Electric? It's not just the end of an era, it's also the end of the great Jack Welch experiment, and the Jack Welch experiment, remember at the moment that he retired, he was perhaps one of the most revered CEOs in American commerce. I think that it has been shown ever since then that he built sand castles in the air. That this was a company that was built on really a great deal of financial engineering, some things that just didn't turn out to be that sustainable, and so this has been the long day new mall for that type of conglomerate where your financial segment was spun off years ago. It's not shocking to me given how few conglomerates really make a go of it now that this has happened.
Chris Hill: If you go back a few years, GE was really running into trouble. We saw them selling off different parts of the business here and there. This is probably where they were headed anyway, and this is still for all of the downside for this stock. From 2004 when it was the biggest public company in America, and ever since then, where it's gone downhill. This is still a $125 billion company. This is not a small business.
Bill Mann: What about 80 percent from its low this year, bonkers to me.
Chris Hill: It makes sense that it would take some time to unwind all of this. Do you have an early sense of what is going to be the most attractive part of this business? Because, I look at the fact that Larry Culp is the CEO of General Electric, and he has picked the business, the one of the three businesses that he wants to run, and it's the aviation business.
Bill Mann: This is Joel Greenblatt in his book. You can be a stock market genius, talks about this exact situation and his advice is, follow the executives. Follow the executives because they're making a decision that should be pretty reasonably expected to be a logical move where they're spending out parts that they don't really want to manage or think are as promising. So I think that's good advice. I happen to think airline and aviation is a pretty good business up until the part that you're actually flying airplanes, supplying any component to that industry, has been proven over time to be a really good business, so that makes perfect sense to me.
Chris Hill: Is there any part of you, as an investor, that thinks, I'm going to buy a couple of shares here. Just to see, I'm not going to expect much, I'm just going to take it and see where it goes, or do you think, you know what? We got a long way to go between here and 2024 when this is all done and I'm fine sitting on the sidelines.
Bill Mann: I think there's plenty of time, so GE is a company. In the middle of the 2000s, I was on a show called Cashing In on Fox business, and one of my co-panelists, I was actually let go from the show because I was too thoughtful [laughs] for television. In airports, which you could see, I can't do things in six words, but this guy came on and said he would short GE, and I said, how in the world, are you even analyzing GE with its financial division and all of these different divisions. It is probably the highest profile company that I have been uninterested in analyzing for the better part of 20 years now. I'm not going to change just yet, or give it a little bit of time, but I do think breaking apart does. The whole purpose is to unlock value, so this is something that investors, who have never been interested in GE, should pay attention to.
Chris Hill: Shares of PayPal are down 12 percent this morning after third quarter revenue was lower than Wall Street was hoping for, guidance for the fourth quarter and for 2022 both lower than expected as well. We knew that the eBay transition was going to be bumpy this year. Dan Schulman, the CEO, said, ''The third quarter was the one where PayPal would see'' and I'm quoting here, ''The max impact on our result.'' I don't have any reason to not believe Dan Schulman but as a shareholder of PayPal, I hope he's right. I hope this is the max score. We'll see some ripple effects in Q4 and the early 2022, but what do you think in terms of the results? Did anything standout to you? Because it seems like this is one of those quarters that was really about the transition away from eBay.
Bill Mann: I happen to think that that's at least partially true, and this may not come as a fun comment to you as a PayPal shareholder. I also wonder if PayPal is in the process of being beaten alive by the likes of Shopify, which manages the full transaction, the full process, for online businesses, whereas all PayPal is really managing is the transaction. I am not sure that PayPal is the best option in any one of the segments where it is competing at this point. The flip side of that is, as we know in technology going over years, even in bleeding edge tech, which the back end of PayPal's certainly is that, you don't have to be the best, you have to be the most ubiquitous, and you have to be the default, so the fact that they are joining Amazon at the hip, that's still something that has yet to really manifest itself, and probably will be a big deal. I'm not particularly surprised by the results. They did what they said they were going to do, and that's all fine. I am a little concerned about PayPal, given the competitive forces that are coming at it from all sides.
Chris Hill: The user base is huge.
Bill Mann: The user base is huge.
Chris Hill: You touched on this, but when you look at PayPal proper, you look at Venmo, they have a massive installed base.
Bill Mann: They do. From the consumer end, that's true. But there's another part of the coin which is the merchant end, and I think that the Wix's and the Shopify's of this world are a little bit more comprehensive in how they interact with most online merchants. Now, Amazon doesn't need any of the stuff other than the transactions. For Amazon, it's just we have got this. That's a great companion for PayPal. I do wonder about how they are going to compete as we see companies like Shopify just being rampant and taking care of online businesses end-to-end.
Chris Hill: You don't look at the stock down 35 percent from its high and think, ""Oh, this is the time to back up the track.""
Bill Mann: Well, it's down 12 percent today and they're down 35 percent from its high. I think PayPal, like a lot of companies. Again, we have to remember that 2021 is a weird year because 2020 was so unpredictable. How much of the growth that these companies saw in 2020 were due to the pandemic and to just changes of habits that are temporary versus permanent. I'm not particularly interested in PayPal at this price. Though I do think the point that you made is exactly right and to ignore it is to be foolish in small f way that this is a company with a massive installed base, for a lot of people it is still the default.
Chris Hill: The stock of the day is Roblox shares up 35 percent as revenue in the third quarter for Roblox doubled. Of course, there are other members in their third-quarter report [laughs] but their revenue doubled.
Bill Mann: Doubled? Yes.
Chris Hill: Do the results warrant this stock movement?
Bill Mann: Yes.
Chris Hill: It does. Because I don't look at Roblox and I could be wrong about this. I don't look at Roblox as a business that a lot of people are betting against. When I saw the stock shooting up, I didn't think to myself, ""Well, that's the short running for the exit.""
Bill Mann: Yes, exactly. Thank goodness, something good is happening to them at last. Their stock has been and you're right, not too many people have been betting against Roblox, but at least partially this reaction was the fact that a number of gaming companies have come out and reported, and have warranted, and their results have been light and then Roblox comes out and they dropped the hammer, their earnings doubled. That is an incredible result. Again, just to go back to the theme, we don't really know what was real and what was temporary from the year 2020. But a doubling of revenues for Roblox in a gaming environment that for the summer of 2021 has across the board been a little bit weak, is really amazing. Now, the thing with Roblox is that they also put out another number which is bookings, and their bookings number and their revenue numbers are a little bit different. I happen to think that the bookings number, which is basically the subscription number, was up 28 percent, which was a little bit light, but to me, that's a scratch on a Ferrari for this quarter. It really was amazing.
Chris Hill: This is a company that went public back in March. We talk all the time about, as a general rule of thumb, you don't have to jump into an IPO because it's more complicated and more difficult to run a public company than it is to run a private company. Now, we're a couple of quarters in with Roblox. Have you seen enough from Roblox management that you feel like you have a sense of how they are doing in the public markets? I'm not talking about the stock. I'm just talking about the CEO and the CEO's team.
Bill Mann: I love this question. I do feel like they've got a handle on it. I think it's really important because people who were excited about companies almost never want to hear bad news or slightly negative analysis. Every single company has risk factors attached to it, and every single company is dysfunctional in some way. Most companies that we talk about here are dysfunctional in a way that is overcome by other forms of excellence. In the case of Roblox, their general and administrative expenses exploded since they've been public. That may be a sign that they were holding back a bunch of expenses so that their documents when they went public, were as clean and as good-looking as possible. That concerns me a little bit and that's something that I want to pay attention to over the next couple of months because you're right. I don't tend to get interested in companies after they've been public for more than a year, simply because you do see how they start to operate as a public company and it is different.
Chris Hill: I suppose there are a lot of businesses in different industries that are like this, but Roblox is one of those businesses that is more complicated than the surface where people first come to. It's basically, ""Oh it's the kid's game."" It's the game that my kids play. It's like, ""Oh OK, yes, I get it. By the way, there are a lot of businesses that are trying to get a younger audience. It seems like Roblox is the reverse. They've got the kids. They're trying to figure out what can we create that are going to keep them when they're teenagers and into their 20s and 30s.
Bill Mann: I think that's exactly right. They have a hammer lock on an incredibly valuable segment. They would like to get more females into the mix. It is still somewhat heavily skewed toward young males, so they have plenty of places where they can go. It's no sure thing that they will get there, but I think that if you are a company that has the constituencies that Roblox has, you were very much at an advantage over ones that are trying to skew younger.
Chris Hill: Bill Mann, always great talking to you. Thanks so much for being here.
Bill Mann: Thank you, Chris.

2021-11-15 00:00:00+00:00,7 Stocks to Buy to Combat the Great Resignation,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/7-stocks-to-buy-to-combat-the-great-resignation,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
The pandemic has brought many shifts in personal and professional lives. Among the latest is the âphenomenon in recruitment and retention â the Great Resignation. News media has been increasingly absorbed with mass resignations that have occurred and their causes and potential impact, especially in the United States and United Kingdom,â highlights research led by Dr Martin Power of the National University of Ireland. Itâs caused a massive rethinking of which stocks to buy as companies reel from labor shortages.
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 4.4 million Americans left their jobs voluntarily in Augustâa record number. Resignations increased in accommodation and food services, wholesale trade, and state and local government education. A recent Harvard Business Review article further points out âEmployees between 30 and 45 years old have had the greatest increase in resignation rates, with an average increase of more than 20% between 2020 and 2021.â
As the âGreat Resignationâ has the potential to impact the U.S. economy significantly, businesses leaders and investors cannot ignore this movement. For instance, investors might keep an eye on how their portfolio companies fare in retaining their workforce and attracting top talent.
7 Stocks to Buy With Stacks of Free Cash Flow
With that information, here is a list of seven stocks to buy that could directly or indirectly benefit from the Great Resignation movement:
eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY)
Fiverr International (NYSE:FVRR)
Hubspot (NYSE:HUBS)
Shopify (NYSE:SHOP)
SoFi Gig Economy ETF (NASDAQ:GIGE)
Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER)
Upwork (NASDAQ:UPWK)
Stocks to Buy: eBay (EBAY)

52-week range: $47.96 â $81.19
Dividend: 0.98%
E-commerce group eBay needs little introduction as both individuals and businesses can easily reach buyers worldwide. 2021 has so far meant impressive gains for EBAY stock, which is up over 50%. If some of the people quitting their jobs decide to start selling merchandise on eBay, we can expect the company to become one of the beneficiaries of the Great Resignation trend.
In late October, eBay issued robust Q3 earnings. Revenue of $2.5 billion was up 11%, while non-GAAP earnings per share (EPS) came in at 90 cents. The company had 154 million active buyers worldwide. Also during the quarter, the e-commerce group returned $2.4 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and cash dividends.
On the results, CEO Jamie Iannone said, âOur Q3 results, driven by the near completion of our managed payments migration, expansion of our advertising portfolio, and volume growth in our focus categories, demonstrate that our strategic playbook continues to work.â
Since the start of the pandemic, momentum has been with EBAY shares, which are up about 55% in the past 52 weeks. I believe eBay could be a solid Great Resignation stock to research further with a view to buy the dips.
Fiverr International (FVRR)

52-week range: $152.27 â $336
Israel-based Fiverr International is a platform for online freelance services, connecting employers with freelancers. Among the main areas of work covered by freelancers include digital marketing, graphics, design, writing, translation, video and animation.
Fiverr reported Q2 results in early August. Revenue increased 60% year-over-year (YOY) to $75.3 million. Non-GAAP net income was $7.9 million, or 19 cents per diluted share, compared to $3.6 million, or 10 cents per diluted share, in the prior-year quarter. Cash and equivalents ended the period at $146.7 million.
CEO Micha Kaufman remarked, âFiverr delivered another great quarter as we saw robust revenue growth of 60% y/y driven by strong active buyer growth as businesses continue turning to Fiverr to access digital service providers.â
It may not be wrong to assume a large number of employees leaving their jobs look for freelance positions. Fiverr is well-positioned to benefit from this trend directly. In its last update, Fiverr issued guidance for revenue growth of 34% in the third quarter and 50% annually for fiscal 2021. The company will report Q3 earnings on Nov. 10. The Street expects it to outperform growth estimates.
7 Best Cryptocurrencies That Could Hit New Highs Soon
Fiverr stock could especially appeal to risk-tolerant investors who can handle some volatility. Itâs currently $188 per share, down about 3.5% YTD. It is down nearly 50% from its high, offering interested investors an opportunity to buy FVRR shares at a discount. However, despite the decline, shares are trading at 24.7x trailing sales, suggesting an overstretched valuation. A potential decline toward the $150 level would improve the margin of safety.
Stocks to Buy: Hubspot (HUBS)

52-week range: $342.39 â $854.68
Cambridge, Massachusetts-based HubSpot provides a cloud-based marketing, sales, and customer relationship management (CRM) platform. The applications are available for clients in a âland and expandâ menu. As a result, marketers can modify their subscription level as their needs evolve.
Hubspot announced Q3 results on Nov. 3. Revenue soared 49% YOY to $339 million. Non-GAAP net income came in at $25.6 million, or 50 cents per diluted share, compared to $13.6 million, or 28 cents per diluted share, in the prior-year quarter. Cash and equivalents ended the period at $1.3 billion. Hubspot generated $38.2 million in free cash flow.
After the announcement, CEO Yamini Rangan said, âWeâve been well-positioned to meet the evolving needs of our customers this year, as evidenced by another quarter of impressive results.â
The company has recently incorporated financial technology services on its platform, addressing a growing need to integrate sales, account management, billing and collections. Such an updated platform should enhance customer retention and lead to further revenue growth. If more Americans launch their businesses, they could easily access platform services offered by Hubspot.
The stock hovers around $835 per share. HUBS has doubled in value since the start of the year. Forward price-to-earnings (P/E) and current price-to-sales (P/S) ratios stand at 345x and 32.2x, respectively. Those valuation ratios indicate an expensive stock, leaving little margin of safety for new investors, who could wait for a dip to go long HUBS shares.
Shopify (SHOP)

52-week range: $880 â $1704.39
Canadian e-commerce platform Shopify offers focuses on small and midsize merchants who use Shopify to manage sales across physical and digital locations, and coordinate activity on social media platforms. During the pandemic, it was hailed as a convenient one-stop-shop to grow e-commerce presence.
Shopify released Q3 results on Oct. 28. Revenue grew 46% YOY to $1.1 billion. Net income was $1.15 billion, or $9.00 per diluted share, compared with $191 million, or $1.54 per diluted share, in the prior-year quarter.
Adjusted net income declined to $102.8 million, down from $140.8 million. Cash and marketable securities ended the period at $7.52 billion. Investors were pleased with the Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV), which shows the dollar value of orders facilitated via the platform.
âIt took 15 years for our merchants to get to $200 billion in cumulative GMV, and just 16 months to double that to $400 billion,â remarked CEO Harley Finkelstein. âAs the share of GMV from offline expanded within our total GMV, it is clear that entrepreneurs are embracing a future in which retail happens everywhere.â
Shopify recently launched Shopify Markets, a product to make cross-border commerce easier for entrepreneurs. Those employees who are leaving their corporate jobs behind could regard Shopifyâs integrated platform as a relatively easy way to enter global markets.

The stock trades at $1,672, up 48% so far this year. The current price seems to reflect SHOPâs long-term growth potential. Shares are currently trading at 323x forward earnings and 50x trailing sales. Potential buyers might wait for a pullback toward $1,475 before hitting the âbuyâ button.
Stocks to Buy: SoFi Gig Economy ETF (GIGE)

Current Price: $37.50
52-Week Range: $31.45 â $48.58
Expense Ratio: 0.59% per year
Our next discussion centers around an exchange-traded fund (ETF). The SoFi Gig Economy ETF is an actively managed fund with exposure to âgig economyâ businesses that work with independent workforces.
Recent metrics highlight the âGlobal Gig Economy is expected to grow from $204 billion in 2018 to $455 billion in 2023, a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 17.4%â¦ In the US, 44% of gig workers considered freelancing to be their primary source of income, with 60% of workers engaging in freelancing activities at least weekly.â
As the Great Resignation steams ahead, we can expect more people to work independently. SoFi emphasizes the high-growth potential of gig companies despite a certain level of volatility.
GIGE, which currently holds 74 securities, started trading in May 2019. The leading names on the roster include Spotify Technology (NYSE:SPOT), Shopify, Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB), Square (NYSE:SQ) and LendingClub (NYSE:LC).
The U.S. represents around half of the country allocation in this global strategy. Next in line are businesses from China, Israel and Canada. Meanwhile, the communications sector accounts for 56% of holdings, followed by technology and consumer staples.
Year-to-date, GIGE is up 2.5% and the ETF gained 19% in the past 12 months. Investors could regard the $35 level as a better entry point.
Uber Technologies (UBER)

52-week range: $38.08 â $64.05
San Francisco, California-based Uber Technologies offers commerce platforms for ride-sharing and meal delivery markets. Despite the companyâs strong growth in the past several years, these markets do not create brand loyalty among users. As a result, Uber relies on cash incentives to bring both riders and users to its platform, making profitability hard to reach.
Uber released Q3 results on Nov. 4. Revenue grew 72% YOY to $4.8 billion. Net loss was $2.42 billion, or $1.28 loss per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $1.09 million, or 62 cents loss per diluted share, a year ago. Unrestricted cash and equivalents were $6.5 billion at the end of Q3.
CEO Dara Khosrowshahi remarked, âOur early and decisive investments in driver growth are still paying dividends, with drivers steadily returning to the platform, leading to further improvement in the consumer experience.â
The pandemic meant declines, especially in ride-sharing markets. Uber also faces various legal battles. As most its workers are contractors, they are not entitled to benefits such as health insurance or a minimum wage. The United Kingdom has already forced Uber to offer such benefits, and some U.S. states are on track to follow suit.
However, the consistent surge in top-line growth provides Uber significant flexibility in structuring its business and coping with legal issues. In addition, Uber has food delivery and freight businesses to boost revenues further.
7 Stocks to Buy That Could Be the Next Trillion-Dollar Company 
UBER stock currently trades at $44 territory, down about 14% YTD. Shares have a reasonable valuation for a tech stock, selling for 5.7x trailing sales. Potential investors should consider buying around these levels.
Stocks to Buy: Upwork (UPWK)
Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com
52-week range: $30 â $64.49
Our last company, the Santa Clara, California-based Upwork is another platform, connecting businesses with freelancers. The Covid-19 pandemic has boosted Upworkâs active client base over the past five quarters.
Upwork reported Q3 results on Oct. 27. Revenue soared 32% YOY to $128 million. GAAP net loss more than tripled to 9.3 million, or 7 cents net loss per diluted share, compared to $2.8 million, or 2 cents net loss per diluted share, in the prior-year quarter. Cash and marketable securities ended the period at $697 million. It also has about 752,000 clients, up 25% YOY.
Management forecasts that the global freelance opportunity is worth as much as $1.3 trillion. However, the rapid growth in the freelance marketplace at the height of the pandemic seems to be slowing down. Yet the Great Resignation trend could still provide significant tailwinds for this growth name.
UPWK stock hovers at $45.50, down 25% from its high in the summer. But itâs still up 32% YTD. Shares are currently trading at 13x trailing sales.

2021-11-15 00:00:00+00:00,"3 Reasons to Buy PayPal, and 1 Reason to Sell",EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-reasons-to-buy-paypal-and-1-reason-to-sell-2021-11-15,,,"PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL) stock has lost a third of its value since it hit a 52-week high back in July. Mixed reports in the second and third quarters, along with soft guidance for the current period, sparked concerns about its goal of more than doubling annual revenue by 2025.
Other factors -- including PayPal's rumored deal negotiations with Pinterest, a Department of Justice probe of the company's relationship with Visa, and an inflation-fueled sell-off in tech stocks -- exacerbated the situation.
But have investors overreacted to PayPal's near-term challenges? Let's review three reasons to buy PayPal -- as well as one reason to sell it -- to decide.
Image source: PayPal.
1. PayPal's user base continues to grow
PayPal ended the third quarter with 416 million active accounts, and its total payment volume (TPV) hit $310 billion. Those core metrics, along with its total revenue, have consistently grown by double digits year over year:
GROWTH (YOY)
Q3 2020

Data source: PayPal. As reported on a currency-neutral basis. YOY = year-over-year.
PayPal expects to end the current quarter with more than 430 million active accounts, which would represent at least 14% year-over-year growth.
During the earnings call, CEO Dan Schulman said PayPal still remained ""quite confident"" in its goal of hitting 750 million active accounts in 2025. That target, which supports another goal of generating more than $50 billion of revenue by that same year, implies its active accounts will increase at a compound annual rate (CAGR) of nearly 15% over the next four years.
That expansion relies on the ability of PayPal's new ""super app"" -- which bundles together a digital wallet, a savings account, peer-to-peer payments, bill payments, direct deposits, cryptocurrency services, BNPL (buy now, pay later) services, and other offerings -- to lock in its users, widen its moat against rivals like Square, and reduce its churn rates.
2. Its new partnership with Amazon
Over most of the past three years, PayPal's revenue growth was throttled by its loss of eBay to Adyen.
However, PayPal has continued growing on its own, and it recently signed a new partnership with Amazon, which will enable the e-commerce giant to start accepting Venmo payments in 2022.
Venmo is already a peer-to-peer payments leader with over 80 million customers, but it's facing tough competition from Square's Cash App, which surpassed 70 million annual active users earlier this year. Partnering with Amazon will generate fresh tailwinds for Venmo and help the service maintain its narrow lead.
3. Its stock is reasonably valued
The past four months have been rough for PayPal investors, but the sell-off has reduced the stock's valuation to more reasonable levels.
As of this writing, PayPal trades at 39 times forward earnings, eight times next year's sales, and less than five times its 2025 revenue target of $50 billion. It's not undervalued, but it looks more attractive (especially relative to its profits) than many of its fintech peers.
By comparison, Square -- which generates more volatile returns due to its heavy dependence on Bitcoin revenue -- trades at 122 times forward earnings and just over five times next year's sales. Adyen trades at 122 times forward earnings and 57 times next year's sales.
The one reason to sell PayPal: margins
A lot of investors are fixated on PayPal's active account and revenue goals for 2025, but they might be paying less attention to its goal of increasing earnings at a CAGR of 22% from 2020 to 2025.
It expects to achieve that growth rate by expanding its operating margin and consistently repurchasing shares.
However, PayPal has been gradually buying more companies -- including Honey in 2020 and Paidy this year -- to expand its ecosystem and gain more users. Meanwhile, its adjusted operating margin has gradually declined over the past year as its top-line growth decelerates:
PERIOD
Q3 2020
Q4 2020
Q1 2021
Q2 2021
Q3 2021
Adjusted operating margin
27.2%
24.7%
27.7%
26.5%
23.8%
Data source: PayPal.
During the latestearnings call CFO John Rainey said the company's operating margin is contracting, because it continues ""to invest aggressively in technology and development and sales and marketing, including increased spending on customer acquisition and engagement strategies.""
That ongoing compression, along with PayPal's ambitious earnings growth targets, could cause some surprising earnings misses in the future.
Do the strengths outweigh the weaknesses?
PayPal's core business is still strong, but it may have set the bar too high for itself. As a result, its stock got a bit overheated, but it has cooled off enough to consider buying again.
The company will likely remain one of the world's largest digital payment platforms for the foreseeable future, and its ecosystem will continue to expand as people move away from cash. It faces some near-term headwinds and tough year-over-year comparisons from the pandemic, but it's still a sound long-term investment which offers a great balance of value and growth.

Don't let familiarity breed contempt, though. A long-term perspective in investing can make the difference between success and failure.
There are plenty of stocks that hold the potential to be winners over the long term. However, some especially stand out because of their exceptional risk-reward profiles. Here are three such growth stocks that could set you up for life.
Image source: Getty Images.
1. MercadoLibre
E-commerce will increase in importance. Cash will increasingly give way to digital payment methods. The Latin American economy will expand along with its burgeoning middle class. These are easy predictions to make that have a high probability of coming true. MercadoLibre (NASDAQ: MELI) is one company that's set to profit from each of these trends.
Some have called MercadoLibre the ""eBay of Latin America."" Others dubbed the company the ""Amazon.com of Latin America."" Both comparisons have merit. But MercadoLibre's business model has its own unique twist.
The company dominates the Latin American e-commerce market. It also offers logistics services to businesses in the region. Its payments platform, including digital wallets, is growing in popularity. So is its credit business that provides loans to merchants and consumers.
E-commerce market penetration in Latin America is expected to double by 2025 and continue to grow for decades to come. MercadoLibre's fintech opportunity could be even greater. This stock could deliver a 10X return with the tailwinds at its back.
2. Nvidia
Some companies receive accolades that they really don't deserve. But when my Motley Fool colleague Trevor Jennewine recently wrote that Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is one of the top companies shaping the future of technology, I agreed 100%.
Nvidia is best known for its graphics process units (GPUs) that power video games. However, the company now makes nearly as much money from selling GPUs for use in data centers. Both areas should continue to be major growth drivers for Nvidia.
The company also has a big opportunity in the self-driving car market. Nvidia isn't just a chipmaker. It has also developed software on top of its chips to create a platform specifically designed for autonomous vehicles.
Then there's the most potentially disruptive arena of all -- the metaverse. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang thinks the metaverse economy could eventually be bigger than the economy of the physical world. And Nvidia's technology is poised to provide the foundation for the metaverse.
Don't fret that Nvidia already has a market cap of close to $760 billion. This stock still has plenty of room to run.
3. Intuitive Surgical
I'd nominate Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ: ISRG) to any list of the top companies shaping the future of healthcare. Intuitive single-handedly pioneered the robotic surgical systems market. And it's in the strongest position to take robotic surgical technology to the next level.
Intuitive actually doesn't have to advance the technology one bit to have a big growth opportunity. The company estimates that there are 6 million procedures performed each year for which it already has products and the necessary regulatory clearances. That's roughly five times the number of procedures for which its robotic systems were used last year.
The company also stands to benefit from demographic trends. The populations of major countries across the world are aging. This will almost certainly drive demand for the surgical procedures for which Intuitive's systems are used the most right now.
However, Intuitive is advancing robotic surgical systems technology. It believes there are 20 million soft-tissue surgical procedures performed annually that it can target with new products and clearances. Intuitive Surgical is worth around $125 billion today. I think it could be a $1 trillion-plus company in the future.

2021-11-14 00:00:00+00:00,3 Stocks With Monster Potential After Q3 Earnings,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-stocks-with-monster-potential-after-q3-earnings-2021-11-14,,,"Earnings results provide investors a look under the hood of a company's financials over a three-month period. They serve not only as an important update for investors about how the company has performed over the previous three months but also enable investors to get a pulse on how the business is trending and how management is thinking about the future. With the third-quarter earnings season winding down, we have put together a panel of Motley Fool contributors to discuss three stocks that they see having monster potential following their Q3 earnings reports: Paypal Holdings (NASDAQ: PYPL), PubMatic (NASDAQ: PUBM), and Green Brick Partners (NASDAQ: GRBK). Here is why these stocks could be big winners.
PayPal gets an upgrade in e-commerce payment partners
Nicholas Rossolillo (PayPal Holdings): Investors reacted negatively to PayPal's Q3 earnings update. Revenue grew only 13% year over year to $6.18 billion, a far slower pace than what shareholders have grown accustomed to in the recent past. A few factors contributed to this.
First, PayPal management said travel and back-to-school spending were lower than anticipated during the summer and early autumn months. Second, eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY) is weighing on results as the online marketplace transitions customers over to its own digital payments solution. Though eBay now represents less than 4% of PayPal's total revenue, PayPal's payment volume specifically derived from eBay fell 45% from a year ago. And third, PayPal is lapping a boom in e-commerce spending last year, which was further boosted by pandemic stimulus checks. With stimulus-boosted consumer spending on the wane, PayPal's growth trajectory is moderating.
Image source: Getty Images.
Nevertheless, this is still clearly a long-term growth story. The biggest news from the Q3 update was that PayPal is getting a big upgrade over the lost eBay business. Starting next year, PayPal's Venmo will become a payment option on Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN). Additionally, Walmart (NYSE: WMT) also now accepts PayPal, and QR codes for digital payments are rolling out at gas stations Phillips 66 (NYSE: PSX) and Valero (NYSE: VLO). This is still early days for PayPal as it begins to make the jump from an e-commerce payments provider to one more widely accepted in person as well.
For full-year 2021, management now expects revenue to be up about 18% year over year (28% excluding eBay), and preliminary guidance for 2022 is calling for roughly 18% growth over this year. The company is going through some growing pains as it laps its stellar performance during the early days of the pandemic. However, after tanking more than 20% following the Q3 update, PayPal stock looks like a long-term bargain to me at just over 9 times expected 2021 revenue-to-enterprise value and 45 times expected adjusted earnings per share. I remain a buyer of this top digital-payments business.
The digital ads revolution is just getting started
Keith Noonan (PubMatic): The evolution of digital advertising has already helped shape the modern internet. Tech and media giants including Alphabet and Meta Platforms (formerly known as Facebook) have built sprawling business empires on foundations laid by their ability to deliver efficient, targeted digital ads. Advertising dollars are still moving away from traditional mediums, including cable and print media, while streaming television and other rising distribution channels are opening the door for new winners in the ads space.
PubMatic is a programmatic ads specialist that helps publishers and advertisers get the most out of their ad campaign dollars with its AI-powered platform. The digital advertising specialist grew sales 54% year over year in Q3 to reach roughly $58.1 million, and earnings per share surged from $0.10 in the prior-year period to $0.24 in this year's quarter. The average analyst estimate had called for per-share earnings of $0.07 on sales of $52.4 million.
The company posted a net-dollar-based retention rate of 154% in the quarter, meaning that existing customers boosted their spending on the platform 54% compared to the prior-year period. PubMatic also issued sales and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) guidance for next year that came in well above the market's expectations. It was a blockbuster quarter on all fronts, and the company's growth engine appears very much intact despite some headwinds created by changes that Alphabet and Apple are making to data tracking on their respective mobile platforms.
Shares jumped following the great Q3 performance and strong guidance, but I don't think it's too late to score wins with the stock. With a market capitalization of roughly $2 billion and shares trading at approximately 47 times this year's expected earnings and eight times expected sales, PubMatic still looks attractively valued for a company that's growing at a rapid clip and has a long runway for expansion.
A homebuilder with lots of revenue potential
Bram Berkowitz (Green Brick Partners): The homebuilder Green Brick Partners underwhelmed investors on its Q3 earnings results, generating $0.95 earnings per share on total revenue of more than $342 million. Both numbers missed analyst estimates.
But if you look a little deeper, you can see that the company has all sorts of potential. Green Brick buys land and develops homes in and around cities and states with high population growth, such as Atlanta, Dallas-Fort Worth, Texas, Florida, and Colorado. Green Brick is not your typical development company, however, because it owns most of the land it develops. Over the past year, the company has been buying a ton of land, doubling the total amount of lots it owns, which now stand at more than 24,300.
The company has a backlog of orders that represented more than $1 billion at the end of Q3. The backlog refers to homes that Green Brick has a sale contract for but has not yet delivered. Some of these orders can be canceled, but it's a good indicator of future revenue. The company has been dealing with supply chain issues related to materials, whether its cabinet and window issues in Atlanta or brick shortages in Dallas. Hopefully, these supply chain issues will begin to ease over the next year. Management expects about 90% of homes currently under construction to close over the next nine months from September.
The company is producing a gross margin of nearly 27% yet trades at roughly 8.6 times earnings and just over one times revenue. The other interesting thing about Green Brick is that esteemed hedge fund manager David Einhorn owns more than 34% of outstanding shares. The smart money seems to know something here.

10 stocks we like better than MercadoLibre

*Stock Advisor returns as of November 10, 2021
Danny Vena: I'm actually just going to jump right into my number one position.
Jon Quast: Go for it.
Vena: Because a lot of the arguments are the same. My number one conviction company here is MercadoLibre. This is the stock that I ranked as number one out of the nine stocks that we presented. Essentially, the opportunity for MercadoLibre is several fold. I'll break it up into two big buckets.
First of all, the growing adoption of e-commerce in Latin America. If you think about what MercadoLibre does, it does all of the things that Shopify does. It does all of the things that Square does, it does all of the things that PayPal does. It does many of the things that Amazon does. It does all of the things that eBay does.
When you think about Latin America, a lot of people think, well, that's a smaller market. Actually, Latin America has twice the population of the United States. The United States has some more in the neighborhood of 325 million people, Latin America has more than 650 million.
First of all, you have a population that's twice as much. There's one leg of the opportunity. The second is that we are much further along in the adoption curve in the United States of digital payments and of e-commerce than Latin America is. They are in the low to mid single-digits in adoption when it comes to e-commerce and percent of total sales.
Now that said, if we talk about the payments opportunity for just a minute, MercadoLibre has gone from being a digital payment method that was available only on its platform. It became so popular other websites said, ""Hey, we want to put Mercado Libre as a payment option on our website."" Then it became so popular brick-and-mortar merchants said, ""We want to accept MercadoLibre at our brick-and-mortar store."" As a result of that, the off platform payments is growing by triple-digits and has done for the past five consecutive quarters year-over-year growth.
You see they have a very large opportunity in e-commerce. They have a very large opportunity in digital payments and they have made that leap from just digital payments, but into the brick-and-mortar payments opportunity. I think there are a lot of reasons to like MercadoLibre. It is one of the highest conviction stocks in my portfolio, and I think that's why it ended up being number one on this episode of The Rank.

As the stock market continues to drift sideways this week, investors remain cautious about the lack of direction. That said, e-commerce stocks could be picking up pace today. Some parts of the world celebrate November 11 as the biggest shopping day in the calendar year. This was originally started in China by Alibaba Group (NYSE: BABA) back in 2009 and now many countries are adopting it as well. With the pandemic highlighting the convenience of e-commerce, consumers are spending more than ever before through online shopping. So, does it surprise you that companies such as Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Alibaba are some of the largest companies in the world by market capitalization?  
Well, it could just be the tip of an iceberg for this multi-billion industry. We have seen industry leaders such as Alibaba expanding internationally with great intent over the past few years. Now, even the likes of JD.Com (NASDAQ: JD) which predominantly has its presence in China are showing intent in overseas investments. Over the coming years, the company will âincrease investment in countries that conform to JDâs strategies, no matter if it is on warehousing, logistics, or supply chain,â said Xin Lijun, the newly appointed chief executive of JDâs retail business, according to a CNBC translation. Given these considerations, could the e-commerce space continue to grow? If so, let us take a look at some of the top e-commerce stocks in the stock market right now. 
Best 4 E-Commerce Stocks To Buy [Or Sell] Today
Carvana Co (NYSE: CVNA)
Shopify Inc (NYSE: SHOP)
eBay Inc (NASDAQ: EBAY)
Etsy Inc (NASDAQ: ETSY)
Carvana
To kick start the list, we have the e-commerce platform for buying used cars, Carvana. Through its platform, consumers can research and identify a vehicle by leveraging imaging technologies to have a 360-degree view of the vehicle. Whether it is to obtain financing, purchase a vehicle, or schedule delivery, all these can be done through a desktop or mobile device.  
Last Friday, the company announced its third-quarter financial results. It was able to deliver over 110,000 cars to its customers for the quarter, representing a growth of 74% year-over-year. This lays the foundation necessary to achieve the companyâs target of selling over 2 million cars per year. To say the least, this is yet another successful quarter for Carvana as it remains on track to meet its target. 
On top of that, Carvana also announced a partnership with Hertz in late October. This introduces a new way for customers to save time and money through online car buying and shopping. Hertz will utilize Carvanaâs online transaction technology and logistics network to expand vehicle disposition channels. Safe to assume, the collaboration will benefit both companies in the long run. Given these positive developments, would you consider buying CVNA stock today?

Shopify 
Another top e-commerce company to notice now would be Shopify. Essentially, the company provides a cloud-based, multi-channel commerce platform for small and medium-sized businesses. It does so by offering subscription solutions and merchant solutions. So, merchants will get a single view of their business and customers across all of their sales channels. SHOP stock has risen more than 50% over the past year. 
Let us start by looking at its latest third-quarter financial report. Shopify announced total revenue of $1.12 billion, an increase of 46% year-over-year. Out of which, Subscription Solutions contributed $336.2 million and Merchant Solutions contributed $787.5 million. Besides that, its gross merchandise value (GMV) was $41.8 billion, representing an increase of 35% compared to the prior yearâs quarter.  
Well, the companyâs successful third quarter was accompanied by a series of exciting developments. For instance, it launched Shopify Markets to allow merchants to enter new markets easily. Not to mention, it rolled out Shopify Balance, the companyâs money management product that offers merchants a no-fee money management account with fast access to their cash. All things considered, would SHOP stock be an intriguing opportunity right now?

eBay 
Following that, we will be looking at the global commerce company, eBay. Put simply, the companyâs technologies and services give buyers choice and enable sellers to offer their inventory for sale. Most importantly, its platforms are accessible through an online experience, iOS, and Android mobile devices. Impressively, EBAY stock has climbed more than 40% since the start of the year. 
Recently, eBay announced a new destination for like-new products, eBay Refurbished. Shoppers can discover refurbished items from brands like Apple, Samsung, Dyson, and many more, all backed with a one or two-year warranty. Fret not, there will be a thorough vetting process that ensures every item meets eBayâs high-performance standard. So, consumers can rest assured that the product they buy will be from top-rated sellers.  
Financially, the company has also been firing on all cylinders. During its third quarter, eBay delivered another strong quarter that surpassed most analystsâ expectations. The company reported a revenue of $2.5 billion, an increase of 11% year-over-year. Meanwhile, its GAAP net income was $283 million, or $0.43 per diluted share. Considering its financials, do you believe EBAY stock will have more room to run?

Etsy 
Etsy operates two-sided online marketplaces that connect people and buyers and sellers around the world. Its primary marketplace, Etsy.com, is the global destination for creative goods. For sellers, the company offers a range of tools and services that address key business needs. ETSY stock has risen more than 90% over the past year and over 22% just within the past month.  
Earlier this month, Etsy announced its third-quarter earnings. The company reported a consolidated GMS of $3.1 billion, representing an increase of 17.9% year-over-year. Coincidentally, the companyâs consolidated revenue also grew 17.9% to $532.4 million. This impressive performance shows that millions of buyers who found Etsy during the pandemic are sticking with what the company has to offer.
On top of that, the companyâs third-quarter was also filled with exciting initiatives that align with its Right to Win strategy. To list a few, the company began to leverage XWalk, a real-time graph retrieval engine. This allows the company to narrow the semantic gap by relying less on listing taxonomy and more on buyer interests. Furthermore, Etsy also launched âThe Etsy Houseâ, an augmented-reality feature that allows buyers to shop in a digital home filled with curated items. Given these considerations, would ETSY stock be a top e-commerce stock to buy now?

PayPal reported revenue of $6.18 billion, up 13% year over year (YOY) and down 1% quarter over quarter. Total payment volume of $310 billion for the quarter was up 26% YOY. Management informed investors that eBay's (NASDAQ:EBAY) merchant services continue to see a substantial decline compared to a year ago. Excluding eBay's merchant services, revenue and total payment volume would have grown at more robust levels.
In mid-October, PayPal completed its acquisition of Paidy, a Japanese buy-now-pay-later platform. Management also announced the recent expansion of PayPal's crypto services in the UK, and more importantly, Venmo will be an accepted payment solution for Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) starting in 2022.
The guidance for PayPal's upcoming quarter and preliminary results for next year's revenue did not meet analysts' expectations. Following earnings, numerous analysts have cut their price target for PayPal. PayPal's stock price is down over 33% from its 52-week high.

2021-11-11 00:00:00+00:00,Better Buy: Pinterest vs. PayPal,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/better-buy%3A-pinterest-vs.-paypal,,,"After a proposed acquisition of Pinterest (NYSE: PINS) for $45 billion by PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ: PYPL) fell through, both companies have taken the spotlight. After the deal died, there was a discussion over whether or not this acquisition would have been a good mix of two undoubtedly good businesses.
Out of the two companies, however, which one is better? There is no debating that these two companies have immense potential in front of them, but which one is better to invest in today? Two Motley Fool contributors take this question head-on.
Image source: Getty Images.
Pinterest: A potential multibagger
Jamie Louko (Pinterest): If you're looking for an established company that still has the potential to grow multiples bigger than its current size, Pinterest might be a good place to park cash. Pinterest is a social media company that helps drive inspiration and creativity in people. Many people go to Pinterest looking for something, but don't have an image or item in mind. The users will ""know it when they see it,"" and they are looking to buy the item when they find it. Eighty-nine percent of users have the intent to purchase, which makes advertisements on the platform extremely valuable.
On Pinterest, ads enhance the user experience, whereas ads diminish the experience on other social media platforms. This aspect has resulted in immense success in the third quarter of 2021, where the company's revenue soared 43% to $633 million. The company grew its average revenue per user (ARPU) by 37% to $1.43, which still has tons of room to expand. Meta Platforms' ARPU is nearly $10, and considering the satisfaction of advertisements on Pinterest, it is reasonable to believe that Pinterest could reach that figure over the next five years. Net income grew from negative $94 million in Q3 2020 to positive $94 million in Q3 2021 and it has generated a massive $536 million in free cash flow so far this year.
The main growth avenue for Pinterest is its ARPU expansion, but the company needs to maintain its 444 million monthly active users (MAUs) to fully capitalize on this opportunity. Pinterest has struggled to retain users, losing 7% of users since Q1 2021. If the company continues to lose users, its ARPU expansion would be much less impactful. However, its primary focus should be on ARPU rather than user growth. The company has dropped nearly 50% from its highs, now trading at 13 times sales, so investors would likely capitalize if Pinterest finds success over the coming years. Pinterest's growth potential in ARPU is massive, and if it can be successful, the company could become a multibagger.
PayPal: The safer bet -- and the more exciting growth story
Anders Bylund (PayPal): You know PayPal as a provider of online payment systems and related services. The company processed transactions worth $936 billion in 2020, including $159 billion managed by the rapidly growing mobile payment app Venmo.
2020 was a great year for PayPal but the company is doing even better this year. In the just-reported third quarter of 2021, the total payment volume (TPV) rose 26% year over year to $310 billion while top-line revenue jumped 13% to $6.18 billion. Venmo was the star of the show, boosting its TPV by 36%.
Venmo is going places. The service will soon be available as a payment option for domestic Amazon orders. This partnership is notable because Amazon doesn't even take payments through the standard PayPal service yet.
In the third-quarterearnings call PayPal CEO Dan Schulman made it clear that his company had been constrained from this type of deal by its contractual obligations to former parent company eBay. Now that eBay is transitioning to another in-house system for managed payments, that relationship has ceased to control PayPal's business options.
So we're looking at a leader in the thriving field of online payment services, recently freed from a stifling eBay relationship, and armed with Venmo in the even hotter mobile payments sub-sector. Compared with Pinterest's stalled user growth and risky all-in reliance on unpredictable ad sales, I'd pick PayPal's rock-solid business every time.
While both companies could become wonderful investments, the stock that you should buy today might differ between investors. While Pinterest has a longer growth runway, it is also inherently riskier than PayPal. For investors who are able to take on more risk, an investment in Pinterest might be wise, but for investors looking to bring some stability to their portfolio while still having a likely chance to beat the market, PayPal might be more enticing.

Federal Reserve policies around quantitative easing and keeping lending rates artificially low, coupled with massive government spending programs, have created an easy-money environment that's helped fuel the growth of fast-paced businesses. These conditions show little sign of changing anytime soon, and in many respects may accelerate, which makes growth stocks a good bet to continue to outperform the S&P 500 over the next decade.
While the broad market index is setting all-time highs one day after another, one stock, in particular, seems capable of rising above the rest and could help send your portfolio soaring 50 times higher.

Since going public on May 15, 1997, at $18 per share, or a split-adjusted price of $1.50 per share, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) has been an e-commerce juggernaut, returning over 181,700%. It is now one of the most essential and valuable businesses in existence, with a market cap in excess of $1.8 trillion.
Over more than two decades, Amazon has expanded beyond its humble origins as an online bookseller to become the internet backbone of many corporations and businesses.
Yet having achieved such remarkable gains, it's worth asking if it can continue marching skyward. A 50x gain would put its value at some $85 trillion. Possible? Absolutely!

One website to rule them all
As noted Amazon is the premier e-commerce company, with a recent report from eMarketer suggesting the retail giant could account for 41.4% of all U.S. online retail spending in 2021. That's nearly six times more than Walmart, the company with the second-greatest market share at just 7.2%, and 10 times greater than third-place eBay.
Or put another way, Amazon's share of U.S. retail e-commerce sales would still be over 50% larger than the share of the next nine companies combined.
The key to Amazon's retail success is its Prime subscriber service. It has some 200 million members and helps the retailer undercut its brick-and-mortar rival on price and buoy its razor-thin retail margins. Free delivery through the service is just the gateway to the many other services it offers while generating tens of billions of dollars in higher-margin fee revenue.
It creates incentives for members to shop on the website to get the most out of their annual fee and it has been shown that members spend more than non-Prime customers.

Dominating the cloud
The real growth opportunity to increasing Amazon's value 50-fold in the coming years is arguably its Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud-based offering. Already the undisputed leader in cloud infrastructure market share, it's poised to generate over $60 billion in annual run rate revenue based on its performance so far in 2021.
AWS has long done the heavy lifting in terms of profitability for Amazon, and though its U.S. retail operations have been profitable for a few years now, the cloud services business remains its most profitable segment. Over the first nine months of this year, it has made more than $13.2 billion in operating income, or some 62% of the total.
AWS is set up to be Amazon's key generator of operating cash flow as it creates vastly superior margins to the retail or advertising arms, even though the revenue it generates is only 13% of the total.
According to estimates from Canalys, AWS accounts for 32% share of worldwide cloud infrastructure spending.
A massive growth opportunity
For a 50x return to happen, Amazon's valuation would need to grow from about $1.7 trillion to $85 trillion. While that may sound absurd on its face (remember when Dow 20,000 sounded far-fetched?), it could happen in as few as 25 years at a 16% compound annual growth rate.
While that may also sound pie-in-the-sky, between Amazon's initial public offering and today, its stock has been growing at a 38% compounded rate. So cutting that expansion rate by more than half still means it's possible, and with its dominating presence in the areas most critical to its success, Amazon.com seems to have a good chance of achieving it.

Moreover, user engagement also increased. Right now, users are interacting with a PayPal product 44.2 times per year on average, up from 43.5 times last quarter.
User growth and user engagement are two trends Fool contributors Jon Quast, Jason Hall, and Danny Vena talked about in this video from Motley Fool Backstage Pass. It was recorded on Nov. 1, prior to these Q3 results from PayPal, but the trends they liked with this business have continued. And considering the stock has fallen further from the time of the video, it's likely these Fools think PayPal stock is an even better buy today than it was a couple weeks ago.
10 stocks we like better than PayPal Holdings

*Stock Advisor returns as of October 20, 2021
Jon Quast: I'm going to share some stuff about PayPal. Now real quick, I have been a PayPal shareholder since day one. I actually was a fairly newer investor at the time and I was so afraid that PayPal was going to spike on the first day of trading, that I actually bought eBay before the spin off, so that I would be guaranteed to have shares of PayPal on day one. I've been holding since then up 532% for me since 2015 was when the spin off happened.
You could talk about so many things with PayPal. We could take this discussion in so many different directions. But one that I want to focus on, is something that's a really top priority for this management team. They really want people transacting more on the platform and they want more everyday people like you and me on there as active users so that they can grow their merchant side of the business.
This is the end of 2020 here, I just want to point out 377 million accounts at the end of 2020. At that the time engagement was 40.9 transactions per active account, a little bit more than once a month they're transacting with a PayPal product. The stated goal is to get that up. Then first quarter, this is three months after the end of 2020, bumping that up to 42.2 payment transactions per active account. Then the most recent quarter, up to 43.5.
You can see here that the company's strategy, the company's stated goal is being accomplished. They are getting people to transact more often on the PayPal platform and they're doing this in a variety of ways, by rolling out new products and services. When you see them rolling out things like cryptocurrency or buy now, pay later, what they're trying to do is they're trying to scratch a consumer itch to get them on the platform and transacting more often. If they can do that, they really believe that they can grow the merchant side of their business, really provide analytics and tools to those people who are using PayPal as their selling infrastructure. This is one of the reasons the company acquired Honey, was to continue to grow that merchant side of the business.
Another thing that makes PayPal really interesting to me right now, and I just want to show this chart. This is PayPal stock since it was spun out from eBay, and this is percent off the high. You can see here, there have been many times the stock has fallen 10% or more. But it's fallen 20% or more several times as well.
Jason Hall: I love this, Jon. I want to just say real quick. Guys, this is a feature of great stocks, not a bug. If you go look at the 100 best performing stocks of the past 20-30 years, they do this, this is normal. Right, Jon?
Quast: Yeah, this is normal. I think this is one thing that we're going to bring out. We'll go ahead and bring it out here right after I finish this point.
Basically this is how many times it's pulled down 20% or more. I'm sure each and every time there was plenty of headlines talking about the demise of PayPal. But you go back to normalized and this is what it looks like, completely different. Each of those 20% pullbacks was always a good buying opportunity. Personally, I think this 25% pullback right now is also a good time to add to or create a PayPal position.
Like you said Jason, this is a feature of the stock market. One of the things that we're talking about today, there's two things that we're talking about. We're talking about buying and holding for the long term. When Danny talks about Netflix and how much he is up in Netflix, that didn't happen overnight. That happened from buying very early and holding very long, and he was able to see his gains compound over time to create something very powerful in his personal financial situation.
Other times though, we can benefit from understanding that volatility is normal, that pullbacks happen, that stock market crashes are regular occurring events, and being prepared for them. Not waiting until you get the perfect crash, because if you're always waiting and waiting, chances are you're not actually going to take action when the crash happens. But being prepared for crashes, recognizing that they're regular occurring events. Then you can take advantage and my view Jason, buy a company like, which one is the one that you just presented, Ryman? Did you buy that one while it was down?
Hall: Yeah, that was just been hugely successful.
Quast: There you go. For me, the two others that I'm going to talk about today, I pretty much nailed the bottom [laughs] in last year's crash with both of them. I wasn't trying to nail the bottom, I was taking advantage of a situation that I recognize was presenting good opportunities and invested in some of the better companies that I saw.
Thoughts Danny?
Danny Vena: It's interesting because when you were talking about owning PayPal day one, I did exactly the same thing. I actually own some eBay stock, I have added to my PayPal stock numerous times over the years, and I think PayPal has a really good opportunity going forward. In fact, I ranked it slightly above Netflix, simply because of the explosion of digital payments.
Digital payments was already accelerating, it exploded last year. I think we're going to see more of that going forward, I think we're going to see a lot of touchless payments. I like the fact that PayPal is in Venmo, which is a favorite among Millennials and Gen X users, and the fact that they're expanding that ecosystem. Not only do they have buyers and sellers, but they also have all these different areas. They have the buy now, pay later, they have the digital payments, they have the Venmo, and they have the crypto. They are expanding that ecosystem, I think that bodes well for the future.

Paypal (NASDAQ:PYPL) is a screaming buy after its recent earnings fiasco. PYPL stock fell 12% on Nov. 9 immediately after it announced third-quarter results and forward guidance that left Wall Street cringing.

Paypal stock had its worst one-day performance in nearly two years due to the substandard results. The online payments companyâs shares have now fallen 20% in the past month, bringing their year-to-date decline to nearly 14%.
But at $204.64 and slumping further, PYPL stock looks like a great bargain for investors who are patient and willing to hold the shares for the long-term. And despite the latest earnings miss, there are still reasons to be bullish on Paypal and its prospects.
Weak Guidance for PYPL Stock
On the surface, Paypalâs Q3 report looked decent. The Silicon Valley-based companyâs revenue rose 13% from a year ago to nearly $6.2 billion, driven by a 26% rise in total payment volume to $310 billion.

Paypal added 13.3 million net new active accounts during the quarter, bringing its total account base to 416 million worldwide. And the companyâs free cash flow climbed 20% to $1.3 billion, which enabled it to undertake its $350 million share buyback program.
The companyâs earnings for the quarter ended Sept. 30 came in at $1.11 per share, up almost 4% from a year earlier. Analysts had expected Paypal to see earnings per share (EPS) of $1.07 on revenue of $6.23 billion.
While the earnings results were good, investors seized on Paypalâs weak forward guidance, which sent the stock sharply lower in recent days. Management said on anearnings callthat they now expect adjusted earnings of $1.12 per share on revenue of $6.85 billion to $6.95 billion for the fourth quarter.
Analysts had expected $1.27 EPS on $7.24 billion in revenue. In the latter category, Paypalâs guidance for the entire year was revised down to a range of $25.3 billion to $25.4 billion. Analysts had been looking for $25.78 billion in full-year revenue. The disappointing guidance was like a torpedo hitting PYPL stock.
Paypal Can Get a Boost from Amazon and Crypto
When delivering its Q3 results, PayPal also announced a new deal with online retail giant Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Beginning next year, Paypal users will be able to make purchases on Amazonâs website and mobile shopping app using their Venmo accounts.
The deal was struck as eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY), which used to own Paypal, transitions sellers from the fintech company onto its own proprietary payment system. PayPal said volume on eBay marketplaces now represents just 4% of its total revenue. Partnering with Amazon should help Paypal replace some of the revenue it lost through eBay.
Paypalâs Venmo app continues to be a big focus for the company. In April of this year, the payments platform began supporting cryptocurrency. Payment volumes from digital coins and tokens rose 36% to $60 billion in the third quarter.
Customers of Paypal in the U.S. can buy, sell and check out using a variety of cryptos on Venmo. And with a network of 33 million retailers globally, PayPalâs offerings rival those of Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN), the countryâs largest cryptocurrency exchange.
Paypal benefited from the surge in popularity of both online payments and cryptos during the pandemic. Its shares more than doubled in value in 2020.
But PYPL stock has been on the downslope since rumors surfaced that the company was planning to buy Pinterest (NYSE:PINS) for $45 billion. Analysts praised the potential deal, saying it would give Paypal an engine for future growth.
However, Paypal squashed the rumors, saying it is not involved in talks to acquire Pinterest. Since then, its shares have been trending lower in a decline that recently accelerated.
Buy (And Hold) PYPL Stock
The fundamental story of Paypal has not changed. While the company is forecasting a weaker-than-expected fourth quarter, the long-term outlook remains incredibly positive.
The new deal with Amazon is proof that Paypal remains focused on diversification and finding ways to grow its future earnings. It is also on the bleeding edge of cryptocurrencies, and the transition to digital payments is only going to accelerate in coming years.
With all this in mind, the current drop in PYPL stock should be viewed as a buying opportunity. Get the shares while they are on sale.

2021-11-10 00:00:00+00:00,Expenses Were 1 of the Only Things That Didn't Surge Higher for Airbnb in Q3,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/expenses-were-1-of-the-only-things-that-didnt-surge-higher-for-airbnb-in-q3,,,"Airbnb's (NASDAQ: ABNB) third-quarter earnings report was released after the market closed on Nov. 4. The announcement showed a strong rebound in nearly every business metric at the unique travel company.
Airbnb's business was devastated at the pandemic onset as people understandably were less willing to get on a plane or train to travel. The company took the opportunity to lower costs and make the business more efficient. The hard work is paying off as lower expenses allowed Airbnb to generate record profits.

Airbnb posts record revenue and profits in Q3
Airbnb reported revenue of $2.2 billion in the third quarter, a period consisting of the most popular travel season when the weather is warmer and kids are out of school. No doubt, that helped the company achieve its record results. Still, this quarter's results were much better than the same time in 2019 -- before the pandemic's onset.
Impressively, business improvements made during the pandemic allowed Airbnb to funnel more of that revenue to the bottom line. Airbnb reported net income of $834 million in Q3, more than four times higher than last year -- and yet another record. The improvement in profitability would not have been possible had it not significantly improved its cost structure. Airbnb reduced variable costs, lowered marketing expenses, and kept a tight lid on fixed costs.
To get a clearer picture of Airbnb's cost discipline, consider that its revenue increased by $895 million from the same quarter last year. Meanwhile, total expenses only increased by $462 million.
Those changes should help Airbnb over the long term. Part of that improvement stems from Airbnb's greater focus on its core business while pushing some growth investments further down the line. Those plans will not stay on the shelf forever, and it remains to be seen if Airbnb can keep costs under control while going for new business opportunities.
CEO Brian Chesky hinted at some significant new offerings for the summer of next year, but investors and consumers will have to wait to hear just what those are. Chesky said he would update everyone next spring.
Airbnb has an asset-light business model
Notably, one of the main reasons Airbnb can expand profit margins while revenue surges is its business model. The company does not own or operate physical hotels or resorts. Instead, it is similar to eBay in that it is a platform that brings together two parties to make transactions and charges fees for its service. In eBay's case, the two parties are buyers and sellers of physical items. In Airbnb's case, the two parties are hosts looking to rent out space and guests looking for a place to stay.
The asset-lite business model gives Airbnb the potential to grow revenue rapidly while keeping costs under control -- leaving healthy profit margins. That potential is one of the most exciting things about owning Airbnb stock. Of course, there are risks with that model as well. For instance, Airbnb will have a more challenging time ensuring a high-quality customer experience. That said, the benefits appear to outweigh the risks, and Airbnb is one stock investors can put on their lists to consider for their portfolios.

2021-11-09 00:00:00+00:00,Why PayPal Stock Plunged Today,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-paypal-stock-plunged-today,,,"What happened
Shares of PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ: PYPL) declined by 10.5% on Tuesday after the sales and profit outlook of the digital payments company fell short of the market's expectations.
So what
PayPal's revenue rose 13% year over year to $6.2 billion in the third quarter. The gains were fueled by a 26% rise in total payment volume, to $310 billion.
Notably, PayPal continues to add new users at a solid clip. The payments platform gained 13.3 million net new active accounts during the quarter, bringing its total account base to 416 million.
Moreover, PayPal's cash production remained strong. Operating and free cash flow climbed 15% and 20%, respectively, to $1.5 billion and $1.3 billion. That allowed PayPal to reward shareholders with $350 million in stock repurchases.
Image source: Getty Images.
Now what
But investors appeared to focus on PayPal's muted guidance. Management expects revenue of $6.85 billion to $6.95 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $1.12 in the fourth quarter. That was below Wall Street's estimates, which had called for revenue of $7.24 billion and adjusted per-share profits of $1.27.
CEO Dan Schulman said during a conference call with analysts that multiple factors are contributing to PayPal's cautious outlook for the holiday shopping season:
We are seeing the impact of global supply chain shortages in our merchant base. Consumer confidence has weakened with the absence of stimulus payments. And with the economy reopening, more people may be likely to do their holiday shopping in-store as confidence in delivery logistics is depressed from last year.
eBay's (NASDAQ: EBAY) transition to its new managed payment system is also weighing on PayPal's results. PayPal's eBay marketplaces volume declined 45% in the third quarter.
To help offset this lost payment volume, PayPal struck a deal with Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN). Shoppers on Amazon will be able to use PayPal's popular Venmo payment service as a checkout option beginning in 2022.
