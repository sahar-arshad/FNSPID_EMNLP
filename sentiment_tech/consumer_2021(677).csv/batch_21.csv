2021-06-05 00:00:00+00:00,3 Growth Stocks for In-the-Know Investors,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-growth-stocks-for-in-the-know-investors-2021-06-05,,,"For many investors, a search for new growth stocks often starts (and often ends) with the consideration of companies most familiar to them. Anyone who owns an iPhone is at least a bit familiar with its manufacturer, Apple. Amazon is another top-of-mind growth name. Even if you're not a customer, it's tough not to know of the company's -- and the stock's -- storied success.
The thing is, there's a slew of great growth stock stories out there that many investors have yet to hear about. Here are three under-the-radar prospects to check out.
United Microelectronics
Does the global chip shortage have you down? It has certainly taken a toll on some of the market's most notable tech names like Intel and Samsung, both of which recently reported quarterly results that were crimped by inadequate supplies of critical components. Chipmakers are working feverishly to meet unexpectedly strong demand, but it's not easy or cheap for most foundries to simply add production capacity.
This is a scenario, however, where smaller and more nimble semiconductor manufacturers may be in an ideal position to take some market share from bigger outfits. Perhaps the best prospect among these smaller chipmakers is United Microelectronics (NYSE: UMC).

Taiwan-based United Microelectronics can make almost any chip the technology industry needs, but its core strength is logic and mixed-mode radio signal solutions (mixed-mode just means the component can handle analog and digital circuits, transposing such signals as needed). The good news is these sorts of chips account for about half the overall chip market. More relevant right now, United Microelectronics is planning on spending $1.5 billion on capacity improvements this year, and it has budgeted $3.6 billion worth of investments in increased capacity through 2023.
Too little, too late?
It's true that the most painful phase of the shortage is under way right now with easing expected to take shape in the latter half of this year. Easing isn't the same as ending, though, and Intel's CEO Pat Gelsinger fears the shortage could last past 2022, echoing worries from Taiwan Semiconductor CEO C. C. Wei. If they're right, United Microelectronics' capital expenditures will be money well spent even if they need some time before they start bearing fruit.
In the meantime, this lesser-known stock is in good position to rally out of a five-month rut once other investors learn of its plan to help solve an industrywide problem.
BigCommerce
Most in-the-know investors have heard of Shopify, the company keeping Amazon on its toes by offering business owners a means of establishing their own online stores rather than limiting them to listings on a marketplace owned by someone else.
Did you know, however, Shopify isn't the only outfit offering this solution? A smaller company called BigCommerce (NASDAQ: BIGC) is in the game as well, and it's finding similar success. First-quarter revenue was up 41% year over year, and while the bottom line is still in the red, its first-quarter adjusted operating loss was more than cut in half compared to the prior-year period.
Revenue growth should cool off through the remainder of 2021 to 30% for the full year, according to management's outlook, and analysts believe this trend will continue as growth slows to 22% in 2022. But BigCommerce is making progress on another important front -- given its outlook, the company should swing to a profit some time in 2023. The market's apt to buoy the stock as the company makes progress toward that goal.
And don't think for a minute BigCommerce has merely been lucky enough to be in the right place at the right time. It's impressed some high-profile users of its online store software. Ben & Jerry's, Gillette, and the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum are just a sampling of the organizations that have chosen this company's platform over plenty of other options.
MercadoLibre
Finally, add MercadoLibre (NASDAQ: MELI) to your list of growth stocks you may have never heard of but should know about.
It's often called the Amazon of Latin America, and while that's not a bad description, it is an incomplete one. MercadoLibre is also akin to eBay in that it facilitates online auctions, and it also mirrors PayPal with its online payment service that can be used outside of its own selling platforms. It's got a presence in 18 Latin American countries and is a market leader in most of them.
And it's growing! The company is serving 62% more active active accounts than it was serving at this point in 2020, and they're all spending more. Last quarter's 158% top line improvement to $1.38 billion (excluding currency fluctuations) was lifted by a 129% improvement in online payment volume and 114% growth in gross merchandise volume. That's the scale investors have been waiting on as the operating income of $91 million reversed the $30 million loss booked in the first quarter of last year. Not much more is expected for the current year on the profit front with the consensus 2021 earnings estimate last marked at $0.14 per share. Next year's projected sales growth of 39%, however, sets up what analysts believe will be per-share profit of $4.91 for the same year.
Too bold? Not really. S&P Global's recently upped 2021 GDP growth outlook for Latin America's six biggest economies now stands at 4.9%, to be followed by 2.8% growth in 2022. Moreover, eMarketer estimates Latin America's retail e-commerce industry will be the world's fastest-growing market this year, expanding at a clip of 37%.
Given this tailwind, the stock's 30% pullback from January's peak price looks like an entry opportunity.

This video was recorded on May 25, 2021.
Chris Hill: It's Tuesday, May 25th. Welcome to MarketFoolery. I'm Chris Hill. With me today, Asit Sharma in the house. Good to see you.
Asit Sharma: Good to see you, Chris. Thank you for widening your parameters, and once again, taking a chance to have me come join you in the morning.
Hill: You're a known quantity at this point, I'm no longer taking a chance. We have a big acquisition brewing in the entertainment industry. We have some automotive earnings to get to. But we're going to start with another, I guess we could put this under the umbrella of entertainment. IAC Interactive is in the spotlight this week. IAC is a holding company that has a lot of brands in its portfolio, brands that you're probably familiar with, businesses like Angie's List, Care.com, The Daily Beast, Brides Magazine. IAC is spinning off Vimeo as a separately traded public company. This is the video tools business. I encountered it with music videos on vimeo.com, but it'll now start trading on the Nasdaq under the ticker VMEO.
What do you think about this move? Because IAC is one of those businesses I've always found interesting. Never so compelling that I actually pulled the trigger and bought some shares of, but I'm always interested in the holding company's strategy. At some point along the way, they decided, look, there's greater value here to be had over the next decade or so if Vimeo is on its own. Do you think this is a good move?
Sharma: I think it is a good move. Same with you, Chris, I don't buy a lot of holding companies in my portfolio. I think it's hard to make money in the holding company business. You either focus on one industry and you're doing what are called roll-ups or you try to be some kind of, I don't know, Berkshire Hathaway quasi conglomerate, but you can't be Berkshire Hathaway. No one can be Berkshire Hathaway. But look at IAC, I think that this is a good strategy because they grew Vimeo for several years. These spinoffs typically are tax-free to shareholders. If you are an IAC shareholder, you'll get 1.6235 Vimeo shares [laughs] for each IAC share you own. Yes, I'm reading off the decimal points, 1.6 shares. But Vimeo itself is an interesting business. Some holding companies do a great job in letting good ideas grow and then runoff on their own, giving shareholders a slice if they want to continue holding shares in that, and we should talk a little bit about Vimeo in terms of what it would look like if we didn't have this context of IAC.
Chris, as you mentioned, it's interesting. They have a reputation for quality for those of you who have just landed on their site and seen a very nicely produced music video. This carries over to what they actually do. The video tools you mentioned. Vimeo provides tools to create content within business organizations. You can be a small business or an enterprise business. They have a really wide toolset. They help any kind of business out there create compelling video narratives without having to spend the thousands and thousands of dollars it takes to do it professionally if you hired a professional video company. But that's not all. They also provide streaming services. They provide lots of interactive video services. Not necessarily what Zoom does, more geared toward the business world and content. But I was surprised, Chris. I'll read a few numbers and then I'll ask to hear your thoughts on this. This company grew 44% year-over-year last year. They have high margins approaching 70%.
They have a user base that is growing quite quickly. Their go-to-market proposition is that there are millions and millions of small businesses plus enterprise businesses. They only have 1.5 million subscriptions. So if you look at their big picture, they're talking about 300 million small and medium-sized businesses, one million enterprise customers out there. That's their total universe of potential customers. They're still really small. What I really love about this company, just seeing it at a first glance, looking through the investor presentation, some other materials, 65% of their enterprise customers, so these are big companies that are out there with multiple departments and they need to have video internally at skill for messaging, 65% of those customers start with one or two people in the organization. They're free users, so they take the free Vimeo product and they get a budget to subscribe. That gets picked up by other departments, very much a freemium plus land and expand model. There's a lot to like in this company alone and it's more interesting than I thought, just like landing on their site over the years and seeing a really nice music video.
Hill: Not that we're saying people need to be locked to their screens everyday checking their portfolios. That's not a great habit for a long-term investor. But this is one of those times if you're an IAC shareholder and you're not paying attention to the Vimeo spin-off, then you're forgiven for your heart rate increasing when you see that in a 24-hour period, the value of IAC stock drops 30%. It's just like, what happened? But what happened was they spun out Vimeo as a separate public company. You're now a part owner of that stock so the overall value hasn't dropped 30%. It's just coming in the form of two stocks, not one. It will be interesting to see where IAC goes from here just as a business and a stock because it really has had a good past 12 months, but prior to that, it's a few years of basically just treading water, and I think if you're a shareholder, you're hoping that there are more stories like Vimeo within this portfolio of just scores and scores of companies. I don't know that there are that many more like that, but as you said, if you're interested in holding companies, then this is one to look at. But I don't look at this and think in the way that a lot of people a decade ago looked at eBay and its ownership of PayPal and thought, boy, if they could spin that out, that's going to be a homerun on its own most likely. I look at the underlying brands on IAC and a lot of them are names I'm not familiar with. It's not to say that there aren't some home runs to be had there, but I don't see anything that looks obvious in the way that PayPal was an obvious homerun.
Sharma: Yeah. Agree, Chris. There are some counter-intuitive academic studies I've seen that show that after a spinoff, the parent company performs better than it would have before the spin-off. That's crazy if you think about it. If you look at a company like Vimeo, it seems promising. It's got such a big growth rate. Why wouldn't IAC perform better with everything under one roof? The answer comes down to this. It's that business units get obscured. The average investor can't see how promising one idea is, and that idea of Vimeo in this case, doesn't have its own autonomous management team. It has to argue for [laughs] resources with the parent company. So both companies benefit. They can each focus on more and more core strengths. But it's hard to see when you look through that portfolio another company that to me is as compelling as this one, and as you say, there are no clear homeruns like PayPal, I think was visible to many people from far away and they've proven that out. But we'll see. Maybe we can revisit this, I don't know, at some point in the future and see how IAC is doing post spin-off.
Hill: You can add AutoZone to the list of retailers that are crushing same-store sales expectations this earnings season. AutoZone's third quarter comps grew 29% much higher than Wall Street was expecting. Profits and revenue also came in higher than expected. I know the stock is flat or maybe down slightly, although year-to-date, it's still up around 25%. To me, this is just another strong quarter from AutoZone.
Sharma: Yeah, I think so too. I think maybe they should be getting a little more love to date. But investors are often driven by just so high expectations, especially when a company like AutoZone has been benefiting from COVID. I've almost come down now to Chris, where we are now at this point in time, thinking, OK, is this steamy performance? Is it a sticky performance? Is it stimulus based? Is it just coming off of COVID, something sticky where the company is retaining new customers? In AutoZone, I don't think this has much to do with stimulus as many retailers we've looked at. This is more of a story of, I think, reopening and the fact that they're a commercial business. It happens so often. We have a car which we've been doing some repairs on. A lot of times the quickest place for our repair shop to get the part is from AutoZone. It is to go straight there. They get it, I think at a different price than we could have if we took part and part and took it over. You can see how my wills are returning to decrease the amount I'm putting in this old vehicle. But I love old vehicles. I love a vehicle that's been paid off and [laughs] I can drive it into the ground.
Having said that, that commercial business is really taking off. That shows some reopening strength so this non-retail business and also their do-it-yourself business. Surprisingly all through the pandemic AutoZone, Advance Auto, and other Auto Retailers, they did pretty well even though cars were parked in driveways, Chris. People were doing projects in their driveways. They may not have been driving as much last year, and that effect is still there. Their DIY business was strong this quarter. Net income increased 74% year-over-year in this period. Operating profit increased almost 64% to $804 million. The one other thing that I wanted to talk about when we think of AutoZone and Advance Auto is a little bit like this, they are just a solid cash flow machine type company. If you missed out on this business idea, it's probably not too late. Not suggesting anyone run out today and buy an AutoZone or Advance Auto. But the auto-parts retailers, because their business is so solid-state and stable cash flow, they tend to be big acquisitions of their own shares.
Just skimming through their statements today, really strong balance sheets, current assets of $6.2 billion, total assets of $14 billion, just debt of $5.3 billion, and just churning out great cash flow. If you were to chart their performance, which I actually did [laughs] prep for this show, you'd see how there's this widening gulf between the company's price and the market capitalization over the past 10 years. Price has gone up 385% over the last 10 years, not bad for an auto-parts retailer. But the market cap has only increased 158%. So they are consistently decreasing shares that are available to buy, and that's propping up the stock price. Deceptively, good investments. Do you own any auto-part retailers by any chance?
Hill: I don't. You and I were talking before we started recording about capital allocation and AutoZone's management has a long and good track record in terms of buying back their own stock.
Sharma: Makes all the sense in the world. One more thing about this, I know we have to move on, but I really liked that they were opening stores during the pandemic. It's a global business. I mean, they have business in South America as well as the U.S. But that's another thing that I'm noticing about retailers I really like, Chris. The ones that managed to open stores during the pandemic, they're the ones that worked anywhere on stronger footing. It's just a little plus that I see, and AutoZone, they let up a little bit. They didn't take their foot off the gas too much in their store opening cadence.
Hill: The Wall Street Journal and CNBC are both reporting that Amazon is in the final stages of acquiring MGM Studios, an announcement could come later this week. What is the film and TV library that includes franchises like James Bond and Rocky Balboa class. MGM studios would like a check for $9 billion, thank you very much, and I don't know, they got the money, Asit. I feel like even if this is overpaying, I feel like this is going to get done.
Sharma: Yes. Right now, this is a reported deal, as you and I were chatting about before the show. Is it going to happen? It looks like it will. MGM was a glorious name back in the day. But as you say, their catalog isn't quite as phenomenal as that of Disney. They do have the Pink Panther franchise to add to some of the glorious names. I actually personally I'm a fan of the Pink Panther movies, I think they're awesome. It takes a certain sense of humor, I guess. But on the other hand, they also have a pretty decent TV studio. The way I think about this is, Amazon is just spending a little bit of maintenance money. Their Prime Video service is a distant challenger to the Netflix and Disney streaming options out there. But it never has to be number one in the marketplace because at the end of the day, it really is just a value add for the Amazon Prime subscription.
For just a few dollars less a month, you can buy Amazon Prime Video. I'm not sure how many people actually do that when it's just a little bit cheaper. You might as well get a Disney+ or Netflix. However, for them as they become a little more successful at churning out some creative content, shows that are increasingly gaining an audience and winning some awards. I think about the Marvelous Mrs. Maisel and other shows. I think this is just flushing out the library, you know, $9 billion with the balance sheet, the size of Amazon's, which is like north of $300 billion. I guess you could call it chump change. Part of me is curious, are they just like squandering [laughs] $9 billion, because this isn't the most renowned of catalogs. On the other hand, it'll flush out their offerings a little bit, keep people who have the subscription interested. What are your thoughts?
Hill: It reminds me a little bit, back in 2006 when Google [Alphabet] bought YouTube. At the time, Google had its own video platform, and it wasn't doing as well, it wasn't as popular as YouTube was. At the time they paid $1.7 billion for it. They overpaid, by their own admission, Eric Schmidt, who is the CEO at Google at the time. It came out in documents later, their own internal valuation of YouTube was, we think this business is worth somewhere in the neighborhood of $600-$700 million. They overpaid by $1 billion. Part of the reason they did that was because they knew someone is going to buy this and we want it to be us. Like in part so we can keep it out of the hands of others. That's what I thought of when I was reading through some of the reports this morning . It seems like at least part of what is driving this decision is the idea that someone is going to MGM Studios. MGM has been for sale for a couple of years now. I think that's part of the calculus for Amazon, and they're like look, someone's going to get this catalog of content. Is it worth nine billion on its own? Probably not. But someone is going to get it, and we've got the money. We talk all the time about whether it's Netflix or this new Time-Warner discovery mash up. They're going to be spending somewhere between $15-$20 billion each. In terms of content creation, in one fell swoop, nine billion gets a lot of movies. As you said, the TV studio, the ability to create more stuff, I think that's part of it.
Sharma: Yeah. There are increasingly fewer studios available. That could be part of the reasoning probably is, I guess the last thing that I'll say about Amazon, they have ingrained view of the world that derives from all the investment they've been doing and logistics over the year assuming since day one really, they always see what that return on investment is going to be, regardless if it's in building a warehouse or logistics center or buying out Whole Foods, or maybe looking at a movie and TV studio deal. They always look for a place where they can invest their own money, streamlining some processes and eventually get a much greater return on investment. We shouldn't leave that out of the equation as well. Amazon probably sees something here that you and I don't see, Chris. This one will also be a fun one to revisit, maybe not next year. At Amazon's cadence, maybe in a few years, take a look at what they did with this piece. Maybe they'll surprise us, but let's see. The next step is to see if this deal actually goes through, I'm guessing we're at 90%, 95% Chris.

2021-06-04 00:00:00+00:00,Is Now The Time to Buy Affirm?,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/is-now-the-time-to-buy-affirm-2021-06-04,,,"Affirm Holdings (NASDAQ: AFRM) posted a $247 million net loss in its latest quarter. Since going public on Jan. 13, its stock has fallen 31%. Investors have expressed concern about the fintech company's reliance on Peloton Interactive for a big chunk of revenue, and Affirm has in fact estimated that Peloton's voluntary treadmill recall will cost it millions in potential losses.
Despite this, I think things are looking up for Affirm. The buy-now-pay-later specialist is working toward diversifying its income streams, and its partnership with Shopify should give it a big boost in the coming quarters. Not only that, but the company stands to benefit from the reopening of the economy; many of its travel-industry partners are already seeing increased bookings.
With all this good news, is now the time to buy Affirm?
A large loss in the quarter, but positive signs emerge
In the quarter that ended March 31 (the third quarter of its fiscal 2021), Affirm saw gross merchandise volume (GMV) of $2.3 billion, up 83% from last year. GMV is the total dollar amount of all transactions on the Affirm platform, and is one of the key operating metrics it tracks. Revenue came in at $230 million as a result, up 66.8% from last year. However, operating expenses outpaced revenue growth, increasing 82.1% from last year, resulting in a $247 million loss for the quarter.
The increased operating loss was due largely to $140 million in stock-based compensation following the company's IPO, as well as a $78.5 million adjustment to the fair value of the liability associated with its acquisition of PayBright.
One bright spot in the quarter is that travel was on the rebound. GMV growth in pent-up categories like travel and ticketing grew more than 50% compared to last year. CFO Michael Linford pointed out that travel-related expenses accounted for 11% of Affirm's GMV in the month of April after accounting for just 2% of its GMV in September last year.

Affirm is in a good position to benefit as travel becomes more commonplace, thanks to its partnerships with Priceline, Expedia, American Airlines, and VRBO. Priceline has said that the partnership allows its customers to book with greater confidence, and that it has reached more millennial and Generation Z customers as a result of its flexible payments options.
A partnership with Shopify should springboard growth
One valid criticism of Affirm has been its heavy reliance on Peloton for revenue. In the first nine months of Affirm's fiscal 2021, Peloton accounted for 31% of its total revenue. In the most recent quarter, Affirm saw 20% of its total revenue come from Peloton.
During the quarter, Affirm's earnings included a $3.5 million reduction in total revenue related to the estimated financial impact to Affirm due to Peloton's voluntary recall on its Tread and Tread+ products. Concerns about the safety of the product, which resulted in injuries in children, led Peloton to issue a recall on May 5, offering full refunds in what could cost Peloton $165 million.
Affirm's heavy reliance on Peloton has been a concern, and the company is taking steps to diversify its income sources. One key way it has done so is by partnering with Shopify -- and this is the part of Affirm's story that intrigues me the most.
Affirm partnered with Shopify last July, offering Shop Pay installment options for customers. In February, it had 100 merchants participating in its pilot program, and over 12,500 merchants have gone live with the product as of May. Shopify chose Affirm as a partner because of its speed at converting customers and its ability to offer a scalable payment solution that can keep up with the growth of the Shopify platform.
The company says these payment options will be available to the general population of merchants on Shopify by the end of June, which will significantly expand its merchant base. This is huge for Affirm, as Shopify powers 1.7 million businesses across 175 countries and accounts for 8.6% of e-commerce sales, second to Amazon and ahead of Walmart and eBay. Shopify has grown rapidly, and the COVID-19 pandemic only accelerated its growth. In its first-quarter earnings, Shopify saw revenue of $989 million, up 110% from the same quarter last year, and GMV of $37.3 billion, up 114% from last year.
The partnership with Shopify should be a great one for Affirm, and it has me optimistic about the company's prospects. Shopify posts a GMV that is 16 times that of Affirm, and if Affirm can grab a fraction of this GMV with its payment solution, that would certainly boost its future earnings.
The addition of Returnly could increase sales too
Affirm has expanded its platform in another way by acquiring Returnly, a tech company focused on making returns seamless for customers and merchants. Returnly says it is ""the only return solution that lets customers get the right item before returning the wrong one.""
Affirm CEO Max Levchin said that the company saw an opportunity, saying Returnly ""picks up where Affirm leaves off."" Affirm has the front end of transactions down, providing installment options for customers. But when customers would return an item, Affirm would wait until the merchant restocked and refunded the transaction. Returnly allows Affirm to give trusted customers flexibility to shop with its installment options before they box up and return the item.
Affirm ultimately hopes that this accelerates transactions and helps merchants sell inventory quicker. The acquisition of Returnly could be another key piece to Affirm's growth as it works alongside Shopify and other major platforms.
What to expect going forward
Affirm provided guidance for its upcoming fourth quarter, expecting GMV of $2.20 billion to $2.25 billion and revenue of $215 million to $225 million. It expects to see a smaller operating loss of $50 million to $55 million.
This has some analysts optimistic about Affirm, with Bank of America securities analyst Jason Kupferberg giving the company a buy rating with a price target of $71, a roughly 15% gain from here. If the company's partnership with Shopify pays off, there's no reason Affirm couldn't blow past that price target. The stock is 56% off its high, and I think at this price it's not a bad time to start a position.

The company said that new and pre-owned handbags costing more than $500 from 16 luxury brands like Saint Laurent, Gucci, Celine, Balenciaga and many more will be professionally authenticated, starting from Wednesday onwards. The decision to include handbags is part of the company's authentication program, which was started in the later half of 2020 with luxury watches priced around $2,000 and sneakers priced at $100.

2021-05-27 00:00:00+00:00,July 9th Options Now Available For eBay,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/july-9th-options-now-available-for-ebay-2021-05-27,,,"Investors in eBay Inc. (Symbol: EBAY) saw new options begin trading today, for the July 9th expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the EBAY options chain for the new July 9th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $54.50 strike price has a current bid of 14 cents. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $54.50, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $54.36 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of EBAY, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $61.53/share today.
Because the $54.50 strike represents an approximate 11% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 100%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 0.26% return on the cash commitment, or 2.18% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for eBay Inc., and highlighting in green where the $54.50 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $65.50 strike price has a current bid of 56 cents. If an investor was to purchase shares of EBAY stock at the current price level of $61.53/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $65.50. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 7.36% if the stock gets called away at the July 9th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if EBAY shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for eBay Inc., as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing EBAY's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $65.50 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $65.50 strike represents an approximate 6% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 0.91% boost of extra return to the investor, or 7.73% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.

2021-05-24 00:00:00+00:00,U.S. Treasury deputy chief sees G7 backing for 15%-plus global minimum tax,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/u.s.-treasury-deputy-chief-sees-g7-backing-for-15-plus-global-minimum-tax-2021-05-24,,,"By David Lawder
WASHINGTON, May 24 (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Deputy Secretary Wally Adeyemo said he expects strong backing from G7 peers for Washington's proposed 15%-plus global minimum corporate tax, which should help solidify support in the U.S. Congress for domestic corporate tax legislation.
""My sense is that you're going to see a lot of unified support amongst the G7 moving forward,"" Adeyemo told Reuters on Monday after France, Germany, Italy and Japan made positive comments about the Treasury's proposal.
That support may be voiced at an in-person meeting of G7 finance ministers in London on June 4-5, Adeyemo said.
Optimism about a long-sought comprehensive deal for how to tax the largest multinationals and digital services companies has increased since the Treasury last week said it would accept a global minimum tax rate of 15% or higher.
The rate is well below the Biden administration's proposed 21% minimum rate for U.S. companies' overseas income and its 28% proposed domestic corporate tax rate.
The Financial Times on Thursday reported that G7 countries are close to agreement on the corporate taxation of multinational firms. While the talks are taking place among nearly 140 countries through the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), G7 countries -- the United States, Japan, Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada -- have a strong influence over multilateral decisions.
The reaction from G7 chair Britain, which currently has a 19% corporate tax rate, has been more guarded. Asked if Britain would support Washington's 15% minimum proposal, Prime Minister Boris Johnson shifted the focus to taxation of large tech companies such as such as Alphabet Inc GOOGL.O and Facebook Inc FB.O.
""Reaching an international agreement on how large digital companies are taxed is a priority, and we welcome the U.S.'s renewed commitment to reaching a solution,"" Johnson said.
The U.S. global minimum tax proposal is expected to be a key topic of discussion at a preliminary virtual G7 finance leaders meeting on Friday.
DOMESTIC TAX LINKAGE
Adeyemo, who is involved in the OECD tax talks, said he expects a broad international commitment of 15% or more to build support in Congress for a U.S. corporate tax increase by narrowing the gap between U.S. and overseas rates.
In 2017, the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress cut the U.S. corporate tax rate to 21% and instituted a minimum tax rate on overseas income from intangible sources of 10.5%. Business groups including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce have opposed any increases in U.S. tax rates, arguing they would put U.S. firms at a disadvantage.
Adeyemo said a higher U.S. minimum tax would provide incentives for other countries to move toward the U.S. rate.
""If we can get the world to say that they’re willing to do at least 15%, it gives us the ability to come back to the international conversation once we’ve finished the domestic piece.""
Senate Finance Committee Chairman Ron Wyden said he was encouraged by Treasury's progress in the negotiations.
""A global agreement could support necessary reforms to U.S. tax laws, ensuring our multinational corporations are incentivized to invest in the United States and pay their fair share,"" Wyden said.
Negotiators in the OECD tax talks have been aiming for an agreement in principal this summer.
By the time of a G20 finance leaders meeting in Venice in July, there should be a good sense of unity around a global minimum tax structure, Adeyemo said. He added that there would be many technical details to work out, so a final agreement may have to wait until G20 leaders meet in Rome at the end of October.

This video was recorded on May 14, 2021.
Dylan Lewis: It's Friday, May 14, and we're talking three Fool favorites that just reported earnings. I'm host Dylan Lewis. I'm joined by fool.com's ill-advised indexer of incomplete information, Brian Feroldi. Brian, how are you doing?
Brian Feroldi: I'm doing better than my portfolio is doing, Dylan. How are you doing?
Lewis: Yeah, I know how that feeling. It's been a little bit of a rough week if you're a little bit more growth minded.
Feroldi: It's been a rough couple of weeks or even couple of months if you are growth minded. If you were a buyer say in February, the last few months have been brutal. If you have cash on the sidelines and are interested in growth, the last few months have been great.
Lewis: We talk about it all the time, but it's nice to have some cash on the sidelines so that those days where you're seeing a lot of red in your portfolio feel a lot more like opportunities than they do lost money. I haven't done any buying immediately, in part because I wanted to make sure I was clear to talk about a couple of companies on today's show. But I have some cash on the side and I'm planning on putting it to use over the next couple of weeks. Looking like there are some pretty attractive buying opportunities out there, especially because a lot of those companies, Brian, were on my list anyways. They were companies at higher valuations that I was already interested in.
Feroldi: Spoiled for choice, we did a show on Motley Fool Live earlier this week, where we had to talk about a stock that we own that was down 25%, I had a few dozen choices to choose from, Dylan.
Lewis: That's right, over the long term you don't feel those things quite as much. But short term, man do they bite, and that's where the people that bought a lot of these high growth businesses in early 2020, maybe mid-2020 are probably sitting on some pretty great returns. If your cost basis is tied to selling a little bit closer, maybe the last three or so months, certainly for a lot of more high growth oriented stocks, you might be feeling a little bit more pain.
Feroldi: One of my favorite tricks to do whenever I'm feeling short term bad about myself is just zoom out. The longer I zoom out of my portfolio, the better I feel.
Lewis: People know that we're not just talking about things hypothetically here. The first business we are going to be talking about and doing earnings on is a company I own, it's Olo. We've talked about it on the show before, Brian and I did prospectus break down when it first came available. I'm currently in the red on this investment. No bones about it, it is one of those businesses where I'm usually not someone who's buying shares of the business immediately after an IPO, saw a lot of things that I liked with this company though, decided just to get a small tracking position and wanted to see more results come in. We finally have our first glimpse at their results as a publicly traded company. First earnings report came out earlier this week, Brian, what did you see?
Feroldi: Well, let's back up and talk a little bit about Olo, because that is not a company that I am sure many people are familiar with. To your point, this is a show we did a deep dive on when their S-1 came out on Friday, February 26th. We went through and we said, Wow, tons to like about this business. They did come public on March 19th at $25 per share and they raised just under $500 million. Now, the name Olo, is a shorthand for online ordering and this company helps restaurants to take customer demand online. They were actually founded in 2005, first got started by helping restaurants take orders via text message. Over time, they have slowly evolved to build out a software as a service product that is enterprise grade. They have done a fabulous job at getting the who's who in the restaurant industry on board. As of the most recent quarterly report this company had 400 big name restaurant brands on their platform including: Five Guys, Shake Shack, Chili's, Wingstop, Applebee's, Cheesecake Factory and more, so that is a cusp of what they do and who they are.
Lewis: Yeah, and I think even in that rundown, our listeners can probably start pulling out the core elements of the thesis with a company like this, right? SaaS provider, recurring revenue and the major tailwind here is restaurants brick and mortar going digital in creating good opportunities for, in this case with Olo, restaurants to own a little bit more of that experience than be so reliant on some of the third party logistics apps that they've become in some ways beholden to.
Feroldi: Again, if you are a restaurant train you want to own the customer experience. Yes, it's nice to get an order from a GrubHub or DoorDash or an Uber Eats. But then those platforms own the customer, you are just the delivery platform. Olo allows those big chains to own the customer experience, so that they can use their own app or their own website to place the order and do the delivery. Importantly, Olo partners with many of those delivery services so that the companies can still have their orders delivered, but they keep the customer experience in-house. That's an important distinction.
Lewis: For people that have been following the delivery trends, the DoorDashes, the Uber Eats of the world, they know that the pandemic has been an incredibly high growth period for these businesses. They have really come front and center. There have been some issues that have come along with that, but this has been a booming business period for companies in this space. That's really what we see when we look at these first earnings reports from this business.
Feroldi: Yes, the first earnings report is a critical one in my opinion it is basically the company's coming out party. It sets the tone for what investors can expect out of this company. On that front, man is there a lot to like here. So the number of locations that Olo has under its platform grew 42% to 69,000. Average revenue per unit grew 61% to 525 and the dollar based net revenue retention rate remained at over 120%. You mix those together and you get some fabulous results in the income statement. Our revenue grew 125% to $36 million. Non-GAAP gross profit increased 151%, so gross margin here increased to 83%. Net loss on a GAAP basis exploded to $26 million. But on a non-GAAP basis, the company remains net income positive and they generated $6 million in net income. Free cash flow was $4 million, and thanks to their IPO, they now have over $580 million in cash on their books, the numbers were great.
Lewis: These are fantastic figures and people might be surprised to hear where they are on a GAAP, non-GAAP basis on the bottom line. This, I think, is probably going to be a business in general that ebbs and flows with small levels of profitability and small losses here and there. Certainly not in a period where they're trying to be profitable, you hear that growth rate you know they are heavily in investment mode. But it is a little bit different than some of the other businesses that we tend to see coming public. Because Brian, this isn't a company that's hemorrhaging money in the way that a lot of other really high growth tech businesses are.
Feroldi: Yeah, not at all. Again, that's why I always like to talk about free cash flow. Because again, while they reported a $26 million net loss their bank accounts grew by $4 million during the quarter not including the proceeds from the IPO, so that's an important distinction. Now importantly, those are just the financial headlines. The company actually had a number of operational headlines that are worth noting out. The most notable one was they convinced Bloomin Brands, which is the parent company behind restaurants like Outback and Carrabba's to change 100% to Olo from their own home built system. That's a major customer win that this company scored in the quarter. They also expanded relationships with brands like Covers and Nandos. Nandos is actually Canadian company, so that shows that Olo's concept does cross borders. They expanded their relationship with Union Square Hospitality Group, which is the number of companies that are owned by Danny Meyer the famous restaurateur.
As a reminder, Danny Meyer is on this company's board. That's one thing that we pointed out in the S-1 show that we really liked. The important thing there is Danny Meyers companies are really fine dining establishments, which you wouldn't really put together with takeout ordering or our online ordering, so that really shows that this platform works for both quick serve and at the high end.
Lewis: Yeah, and we talked about it a lot. It's worth emphasizing I think with a company like this though, when you hear there's a compelling investment thesis. It's a software space that maybe you don't interact with normally as a user. This is behind the scenes, we don't really know we're interacting with it. You want to see the customer list growing and you want to see brands that have a pretty big footprint, a really established use case deciding to use a provider. We have that all over the board with businesses here, you could put up a ton of different logos and it would cover the screen. I mean, this is a lot of social proof that what they're offering is a compelling idea to restaurants.
Feroldi: That's a really important point, especially some tech that's really hard to understand to follow the customers. Where are the actual customers and the experts in this space voting? Clearly, clearly, the big name enterprise restaurant companies are choosing Olo as the platform of choice, that's a major sign. A couple other things to note during the quarter that were definitely interesting, the company did win over a Goop kitchen and Guy Fieri's Flavortown Kitchen; those are virtual restaurant brands, A.K.A. ghost kitchens. Olo seems like a natural fit into that market. That's going to be a growing market overtime, so it's good to see the Olo is already establishing itself there. Another big and important announcement was that they reaffirmed their partnerships with both DoorDash and Uber Eats. They had an ongoing dispute with DoorDash that was completely settled during the quarter. These companies need each other that's very clear, so it's good to see that they get behind them. Then finally they joined the 1% pledge. The 1% pledge was started by Marc Benioff at Salesforce.com, where they basically take 1% of their employees time, 1% of their equity, and they give it away to charitable causes, that's a nice feel good moment. So Olo really, really got it done in the first quarter.
Lewis: Yeah. There's a lot to like in this report and I'm happy to see it as a shareholder, because companies choose when they go public and you see a really nice growth story. You see a lot of tailwinds and it is possible sometimes the company decides management decides, you know what, this is the right time, because a lot of these metrics that look really impressive might be turning south or they might slow down a little bit in their growth story, not the case here right now.
Lewis: I'm pretty happy as a shareholder with what I've seen. It is interesting though, Brian. We talked about that topline growth figure, over 100% growth. They were put on the 11th,the stock's down about 20% since then. There are a couple of things going on. We talked about some of the pain that has been seen with gross stocks in general. But I do think it's worth talking a little bit about what the company guided for and what investors should expect going forward. Because you hear that triple-digit growth number and you get really excited. Unfortunately, I don't think that's sticking around based on what we got from management. For the second quarter, management is expecting revenue of around $34 million, operating income, on a non-GAAP basis, to be a little over $2 million. For revenue, that's about 40% year-over-year growth. That's where it's really important to understand where the major step change in growth was and then revenue was for a lot of these COVID businesses. Basically going from Q1 to Q2 of 2020, they grew their topline 50% sequentially, which is absolute bonkers. You don't see a lot of companies pull off anything close to that. They are running into much tougher comps for the rest of the year and really going forward for the rest of their time in this business. That means that that growth rate that we're so excited about now is going to come down. I think a lot of people are still pretty happy about 40% growth given the gross margin this company has though.
Feroldi: Yeah, no doubt. One thing that we did call out when we did our S-1 show is, you could probably expect this company's topline to be a little bit lumpy. It is targeting enterprise grade restaurants and winning one of them can result in a massive bump in revenue. If they have a slow quarter on the sales front, that can result in tougher year-over-year comparisons. This is a company you're probably going to have to be more focused on judging on a year-over-year basis for the full-year as opposed to what it did versus the prior quarter. That's especially true when given the things you just said that were the quarters compared to a year ago where COVID just getting started and COVID really in full force. When I see a company calling for 40% growth for the full year, that's roughly what its growth rate was prior to this or maybe a little bit slower, but man, you can't complain about that.
Lewis: No. It's pretty impressive. For full-year to be $142 million roughly, that's pretty strong, puts them at 40% year-over-year growth. The party is not going to be indefinite. That growth rate will come down as the numbers get bigger over time and we're starting to see that. But you look at this business on a trailing basis, 28 time sales, Brian, that's pretty solid. I think for the market environment we're in right now, not bad and about the same, a little bit less on a forward basis when you look at that full-year. Given the margin profile, given the tailwinds behind this business and how early on they are in the growth story, and I think the total addressable market, I'm very happy as a shareholder again, with this report.
Feroldi: Yes. One other thing we didn't call out, but I think it's worth a double click on that we've really impressed about this company when we did the S-1. This company spends very little on sales and marketing. Because again, it is targeting the headquarters of big restaurants and if you can win one of them, you can get thousands of sales in one. This company only spent 11% of its revenue on sales and marketing last quarter. That was down from 14% in the year-ago period. By contrast, it spent 40% on research and development. That was also down. But I love it when I see companies like this spending enormously on research and development and very little on sales and marketing and still producing incredible topline growth.
Lewis: Yeah. Given where they are with profitability and hovering around break-even and where they are with their cash flow, the fact that they have hundreds of millions of dollars in cash and equivalents, they can invest really heavily if they see really good opportunities to do so. They're in a spot where if they think they can really effectively spend with marketing, that's a tool that's totally at their disposal and they have the liquidity and the financial flexibility to pull it off.
Feroldi: You got it.
Lewis: Switching gears, Brian. I don't own this one, but I've been watching it intently and I'm actually a user of this product so I'm excited to talk about it. People might be expecting this conversation on the Monday show where they talk about financials, but we're going to steal this one. It's Lemonade. For folks who don't know the finsurance company, which is a fun little portmanteau that I haven't heard too much aside from used with Lemonade fun play on FinTech, Brian.
Feroldi: This is a company that has a lot of Fools feeling very excited and given their growth rates and their differentiated consumer experience, I understand why. But Dylan, you did the homework on this one. What did you see?
Lewis: We reported earnings earlier this week and not surprisingly, the company lost money this quarter a little bit more than expected. Revenue was at $23.5 million, they lost $49 million for the quarter. This is an insurance company. For all of the talk about the FinTech side of it and the tech element of it, at core it's an insurance business. What we need to be paying attention to here is the in-force premium. It's basically the annualized premium for customers as of the period ended. That was up 89% to just over $250 million, which was driven by a 50% increase in customers, 25% increase in premium per customers. The company counts just over a million customers to date. I think it's important to understand a little bit of the dynamics here because you can grow your customer count and that's going to lead to topline growth. But particularly in the insurance industry, you can grow by creating bundles, by creating expansion within the policy count that people have.
One of the things that I was excited about in looking at the results from this quarter and what we got from management, is they're going to be launching a new car insurance product. I think a lot of people that have been watching this company for a while have expected this news. Early registration opened in April. Just for people who may not be super familiar with Lemonade, they currently offer renters, homeowners, term life, and pet insurance. As it is for me Brian, car insurance feels like a natural next step here. The huge issue with insurance is getting people in the mix and you see it with ads. It doesn't matter whose ads you see on the consumer side, they're all touting the bundle. They want you there for everything. I think that Lemonade's going to find a lot more upward mobility if they're able to collect in terms of premiums as they widen out their offering on the insurance side. There are also a lot of nice benefits there because it gives them the opportunity to expand their term, also diversifies some of their revenue basis when it comes to those insurance products.
Feroldi: Yeah, I love to see that. This is a company that has clearly got optionality in mind with entering all these different insurance options. I really like that they are also focused on Millennials, which are not the consumers that've been big on insurance. But if you can get them addicted to your product early and then grow that over time, that's a wonderful strategy. The thing that I don't fully understand about this company is because it's an insurer, the way you have to look at the financials is different than it is for a lot of other stocks. For example, you just said above $23 million in revenue in a $50 million quarterly net loss. That's a pretty wide gap between those two things. Not too often I'm interested in a company that reports to double the net loss than it did in revenue. What happened there?
Lewis: Yeah, there are a couple of different forces at play here. We have the fact that this is an early stage high growth business. I think they are about a $3 billion company and you look at most insurers, we're talking about tens of billions of dollars in market cap. But really a big part of this quarter and the story for this quarter was the company saw huge claims related to the freeze in Texas in February. The place that you're going to see that come through for this business is in their gross loss ratio. It's a pretty standard insurance industry metric, gives you a sense of the claims paid out versus the premiums earned. Typically, you would expect a sustainable insurance company to collect more in premiums than it pays out. That's what enables it to do it without getting any fresh injections of cash. Generally, we've seen the gross loss ratio for Lemonade somewhere in the low seventies and it's been steadily improving with time.
Lewis: Basically means more money is coming in premiums and they're paying out, which is what you want to see. In Q1 of 2021, that spike to 121%. That's 50% it went up. The company said basically they experienced a year's worth of claims in the storm's first few days. It's a pretty sizable one-time impact. But I do think it's important to note the EBITDA guidance for this company for the year remains basically in line with the consensus prior to the storm, and a big part of that is the reinsurance programs that the company has in place. We don't need to go too deep down into that, but the reality is this is, I think what you'll see is a one-time event and one of the difficulties that comes with being in the insurance industry. Brian, another reason that I'm happy to see them opening up that car insurance product and helping them diversify away from strictly being in the lines of business they are. I think it opens up geographically a little bit too.
Feroldi: Yeah. Again, I love the optionality here. I love the consumer focus. I love that they're using AI to not only help with customer service but to pay claims. I totally understand the appeal of this company from the consumer perspective. The thing that I always heard, and again, when you're thinking about an insurance company, you have to think completely differently than you do for a lot of other businesses, you can't just look at revenue and margins and all that stuff and make predictions. Because one thing that I thought I understood about Lemonade was that because of their reinsurance that the margin that they were going to earn was essentially fixed in place, because doesn't this company payout if they have excess premiums?
Lewis: That's my understanding, yeah. I'm still in the process of wrapping my head around this business a little bit. I think that that's pretty standard for the insurance industry and something you'd expect to see. They have a unique model and yeah, they are a little bit more charitable with the excess premium than a lot of insurance providers normally are. That is a big selling point for them as a brand and part of why they are considered one of those more mission-driven, more Millennial oriented companies, and certainly, a lot of people are coming online and meeting these types of products, which is where the appeal comes in. For me personally, I'm actually one of their customers. I have their renter's insurance and was flabbergasted at how easy it was to get signed up. It's dumb, simple to do. They came in at a more competitive price than anyone that I could see on the market.
What I think is interesting with the insurance industry in general is we've seen the rise of companies like Lemonade that are more brand mission-driven, also more tech oriented. But Brian, we've also seen aggregators and basically people that will shop for you. There are businesses like PolicyGenius, which will go out there and get quotes from several different providers and then bring that to you. I think that is a little bit of a threat to the simplicity of Lemonade because you're able to shop multiple providers. But having gone through that process as a renter, Lemonade beat what I got from PolicyGenius, shopping around for multiple places. They seem to have some really strong pricing power and they are really able to pass that along, it's the strength of their data that they have, but I do wonder what that dynamic looks like for them over time.
One thing that I did think was interesting, we got this new metric from management and it's their annual dollar retention number. They are defining ADR as a percentage of IFP, that premium number we talked about before, retained over a 12 month period, inclusive of changes in policy value, changes in the number of policies, changes in the policy type, and churn. We like to see this. This is something we tend to look at for software businesses, anything that has an ongoing relationship with the customer over time. Their annual dollar retention number has trended up over time. It's up into the right exactly the way you expect it to be, but it's at 81%. For a customer-centric, really strong brand, I would expect that number to be higher.
Feroldi: Yeah. We're used to looking at software numbers that are not only higher than this, they are in the triple-digit, meaning that not only is the company retaining on a revenue basis all of its customers, but it's actually getting more from its customers in any given period. Is that a fair comparison to this or is there something that makes this number not exactly comparable there?
Lewis: I think they are pretty similar. They might be different brands of apples, but I think to some extent it's an apples-to-apples comparison. It is a little worrisome to me to see it that low just given that the entire selling point and really the value prop to customers is the ease of use, the simplicity, and what you want to see with an insurance company long-term is they bring people in and they keep them long-term. They established a great relationship with them, they have great data feedback coming in through their customers and their actuarial systems are only getting better as they retain those customers. It's a little hard to tell how to interpret this because this is the first look we're really getting at it as a business. Great to see that it's improving but a little lower than I thought it would be.
Feroldi: Well, on the flip side, this company is primarily focused on renter's insurance. How long did people rent for, a year, maybe two years? I don't know what the averages are, to be honest, but I can see just a lot of churn in that business just by that very nature of the thing they are given out. Again, you can't necessarily compare that to a competitor like Olo. That once you're a customer, of course, you are going to be a customer there for 10+ years. But as you pointed out, it is trending in the right direction, and there might be some dynamics that caused that number to fluctuate. I'm glad that they report it, but yeah, I agree, I would like to see it higher.
Lewis: Yeah. Thinking again about where this business is going and the roadmap for them. If they are able to offer things like car insurance and create underling then they have policies that are going to follow up people as they transition through different phases in their life. Maybe for them, they grab someone when they're in their 20's as a renter, perhaps then they add a car, maybe down the road, it becomes a homeowner's insurance policy and a car. You want to be able to be there for the lifetime of your customer and continue to build out products that suit wherever they are in their life. I think they are doing that, and I think that number is going to improve over time as they do. But I do think that of the things to look at on the report, the incident in Texas, that's a one-time event. There are always going to be those possibilities. It's one of the risks of being in the insurance industry. But in terms of core business metrics to keep an eye on, I think this is one of the most important ones.
Feroldi: Good to know. Based on this report ,Dylan, are you more interested in becoming a shareholder or less interested?
Lewis: I think it stays precisely where it was. I've had nothing but really great experiences as a user, and because of that, it's staying on my watch list. I need to really keep diving into the insurance industry and make sure we got a really good grip on it. Just because this business is so much different than so many of the companies that we talk about often. But I like a lot of what we see and I think if we start to see that trend emerge of more money coming in from existing customers because of that bundling. I think that's a really good sign and something that would make me very interested because they have a tiny piece of the insurance industry. Most people really don't like their insurers. It's an oppositional relationship. If you can create brand affinity in the insurance industry, they're only a $3 billion business. There's a lot of room to grow.
Feroldi: If this business doesn't work out it's not because the opportunity wasn't there.
Lewis: Right. Yeah. Highly fragmented business, a lot of customers don't like their existing provider. What more could you ask for?
Feroldi: Exactly.
Lewis: All right. We have one more stock going to be talking through and that is Jumia. I think folks probably have heard us talk about this one on the show before. This is commonly known, Brian, as the Amazon of Africa.
Feroldi: This is not a company that I was super familiar with, although I do know the gist of the company. What's funny about Jumia is that it is a lightning rod of a stock, even internally at The Fool, I know people that own this stock, and I know people that are betting against this stock, so it is a fascinating company to watch and if you were to take the gist and just say the Amazon of Africa, that sounds exciting. Everybody knows that Africa is a developing continent. There are billions of consumers there, purchasing power is growing, Internet access rates are far lower than they are in developed parts of the world. Again, this is a company that if it works, the opportunity is massive.
Lewis: Really, I think what is so compelling about this business, just from a core thesis standpoint is, we have seen this model work. We've seen it work in the United States. We've seen it work in other parts of the world. It contours up a lot of the same thoughts as MercadoLibre and we can get into some of the specific business segments that help illustrate that. But because you've seen it work in so many places, you would think it's got to work here too.
Feroldi: More importantly, name any big billion-dollar e-commerce company. Where are they not operating? Africa. They are everywhere but Africa because it's so hard to do business there. Again, Jumia has a massive challenge, but if they can make it work, the opportunity is huge. Now Jumia, if you rewind the clock a little bit, this company was established a couple of years ago and they were really in growth at any cost model for a long time. They were a first-party seller, which means that they would physically inventory and house the items that they sold and then ship them out. A few years ago, they shifted their focus from being a got a grow at any cost, modeled to being ""let's actually focus on profitability."" Because of that, they're shifting their sales from being primarily first-party, the way let's say, Amazon did when it was first created to being more of third-party, which is more like an eBay model, where they're just a platform that enables commerce to happen. As a part of that, the company has been ramping up its investments into its payment platform, which it calls a JumiaPay. That is something that the company has really emphasized. Then a few years ago, and actually because regionally it was focused on profitability. It actually exited a couple of markets that it was in Cameroon, Tanzania, and Rwanda in 2019, as it has increased its dependence on these third-party sellers. As a result of that, when you hear this company's revenue number, you might not be impressed. But if you have that context in mind, it makes a little bit more sense.
Lewis: Yeah, I think the books of this business look exactly like the books of a business in transition. We talked about it with companies that are making that transition from the license model to a Software-as-a-Service model. But the books look ugly for a little while, and that's certainly the case here because for as exciting as an e-commerce play in a development part of the world is, you would expect the growth rates to be astronomical and that's not the case, at least the topline here.
Feroldi: Yes, and another thing that makes us even more wonky is currency movements. This company is denominated in Germany, so it reports in Euros, but it does business in all these other African countries that have their own currencies. Then the numbers we're seeing get translated back into U.S. dollars. This is a company that you really have to look beyond just the headline numbers and focus on some of the core operating metrics. Let's dig into some of those. The number of active customers on the platform grew 7% to 6.9 million. The number of orders on the platform grew 3% to 6.6 million and gross merchandise volume fell 13% to $165 million. Management explained on the call that they are purposely shifting away from high ticket items like electronics, toward more low-priced, everyday, everyday purchases in order to deepen their relationship with their consumers. That explains a 13% jump in gross merchandising involvement. On the payment side, the numbers look a little bit better. The total payment volume using JumiaPay grew 21% to $43 million. Excuse me, the total payment volume grew to 21% to $43 million, and the number of payments on the platform grew 7% to $2.4 million. Add all that together and factoring currency movements, and that explains why revenue dropped 6%. However, because they are shifting away from first-party and toward third-party sales, gross profit actually rose 11%. So that's why the context there is so key.
Lewis: Yes, and it's hard to follow, but it makes sense when you start taking management's commentary and pairing it up with the financials. I think it is something that benefits from the long term, but we still need to see all of the gear start moving together. Right now we're starting to see some of it where we have the number of orders going up. That would imply that it's not rapid growth, but at least sticks with the lower-cost, more frequent purchase narrative. But then yet to see GMV going down, that makes sense. You are taking higher-priced items away. That's just what's going to happen.
Feroldi: I mean, the first thing I thought when I saw these numbers was management really emphasized gross profit grew 11% and I was like, ""You know another company that's really focusing our gross profit now is Square because of their Bitcoin investments. They're really focusing on gross profit."" That's the story that this company is trying to tell, focusing on gross profit there. On that front, it grew 11%. They also did a good job of bringing down, cutting costs out of the rest of their business. While they did produce an operating loss and adjusted EBITDA loss of $27 million, that figure was down 24% year-over-year, which again is a faster rate of decline than revenue, since it's a negative number, that's actually a good thing. Their net loss was almost cut in half to $21 million. The losses are getting lower and this company has been issuing stock like crazy for the last couple of months to bolster its balance sheet, it now has 4485 million in cash on the books. While the growth rates don't look good, the company is executing on its plan.
Feroldi: Yes, and I mean, for folks that have found business for a little bit, if those share issuances, I don't know the timing of those, Brian, but if those have been within the last five months or so, they're doing it at a much higher valuation than they spend most of 2020. This is a business that looks like it was on a rocket ship. If you bought it in mid-2020, you're sitting on a multibagger. In some cases, almost 7% returns depending on when you bought. But, I mean, we got to see what they do from here as now a $2.5 billion business.
Lewis: Yes, to your point, in March of last year, this was a single digit stock between $3 or $4. In February of 2021, this stock was in the $60s. You're talking about 20 extra turns if you bought in at the bottom. More recently, the stock, like every other growth stock, has been heading in the opposite direction. Now this is back to $25. Yes, depending on what you get in, the store could look great or terrible. But if you're focusing on the operation results, again, not that impressive growth, but operationally, they're doing what they need to do in terms of profit.
Feroldi: I think that's right and, I mean, I called them the Amazon of Africa before. I think the MercadoLibre of Africa is probably a little bit more appropriate specifically because when you look at the JumiaPay segment, it's probably the thing to be most excited about when you look at this business, it's 20% growth in total payment volume. The number of transactions was up 7%. I mean, both of those numbers are doing better than what we're seeing on the e-commerce side. Think about the roadmap and how MercadoLibre built-out Mercado Pago. This started as something that enabled On platform transactions and has blossomed into basically the PayPal, Venmo style, peer-to-peer and off-market option for folks in those geographies. It's not crazy to take something like JumiaPay and forecast out that it could become something similar, which is a very compelling business in and of itself. You can pair that with an e-commerce platform, especially one that has been moved over to a third-party seller and maybe has a little bit more attractive business model. To think that that's packaged, a really interesting business.
Lewis: It could be, but let's not call it the MercadoLibre of Africa unless we say, we accept minus all the growth that MercadoLibre does put up. But yes, to your point, JumiaPay is an interesting product that is making success. The company did note that 37% of orders that were honest platforms or that were made during the first quarter did use JumiaPay. That was up significantly year-over-year. JumiaPay actually has a loan division where they're actually making loans to some of their sellers. The number of loans that they made grew 90% to, they made loans, 291 unique sellers. I'm not sure how comfortable I would be with this company making loans, but they think that they know that their customers are serially underbanked, so it can make sense to fulfill that need if indeed they do have credits. That's a good credit score.
Another thing that's interesting to note about this company is that they have a network of pickup stations throughout the countries that they operate in, and they are rapidly growing this. They currently have over 1,600 pickup stations throughout Africa and these are places that they can shift their deliveries to and then customers come and pick them up, very similar to an Amazon locker situation, and they noted that a lot of customers actually prefer to use the locker pickup instead of having a delivery done to their house. That might be just one of those works of consumer preferences in Africa. But they see that as a major long term differentiator for this company that will keep people loyal to the platform.
Feroldi: Yeah, and it makes a lot of sense. I totally get it from them from a logistics perspective, it's a lot easier to pull something like that off too.
Lewis: It is, and they can offer their customers lower prices because they don't have to pay a third-party logistics provider for the shipping. Consumers might like that it is not already, might be more convenient, and more secure, but the option to have it be lower-priced, that's an attractive combination. Yeah, there's another element of this business that I think we might tee up and then it will sound awfully familiar to people who have been following other marketplace businesses, Brian, and that's the advertising arm that they are building up. That is an experiment that they are working on and we have seen success on Amazon with the likes of SC. This company does know that it has an audience base that is attractive to a lot of advertisers.
The company did note that they ran over 283 ad campaigns on behalf of more than 137 advertisers, including some big name companies like L'Oreal, adidas, and Unilever. That is a potential growth avenue for this business. Another growth avenue for this business is they're testing a product called, wait for it, Jumia Prime. I wonder where they got that name from, and that is exactly what you would probably guess it would be. It's a loyalty program where you subscribe for a monthly fee and then you get free delivery as well as access to a number of other benefits. They're just in the testing phase on that product, but we have seen prime light products work wonders on lots of other e-commerce sites where if a consumer is willing to pay to become that the number of orders that they make sky-rocket. That will likely be a test that works out and gets deployed everywhere they can.
Feroldi: When you put all of these things together, I think it's easy to see why Jumia is a no-brainer watch list stock for me. It's a business that has a ton of optionality. The payments are interesting. Advertising, we know on the digital side, is a wildly high-margin business and can be really great if you have some other low-margin businesses to help boost your gross profit across-the-board.
Lewis: Prime is interesting, Logistics-as-a-Service is interesting, the e-commerce platform itself is interesting. Honestly, I just want to see it come together, Brian, because I think there's a lot to like here. I just don't quite have enough signs that the market place has traction. I think that that's the thing that makes everything else go.
Feroldi: The other thing they noted that is worth highlighting is that they're still dealing with the effects of COVID where they are. We do know that the timing of COVID has hit different geographies around the world at different times and they are still in the thick of it over there. As a result, that might be one of the reasons why the numbers that we're seeing are not that impressive in a post-COVID world. Could that be an accelerant for these guys? It's definitely possible. To your point, this company has massive potential and they have a lot of optionality and growth irons on the fire. If they can execute, the potential here is huge, but that's a big if.
Lewis: It's a big if. I think what's key with this is a lot of this optionality is built off the thriving marketplace. The payment system being valuable, you can have a wonderfully beneficial peer-to-peer system. But if you can use it to interact with merchants at scale, that's really wonderful. Advertising is most valuable when you have a ton of users on our platform and you want to get your product in front of people that are already shopping for something. The logistics and the prime, all these things require a thriving marketplace. I buy the narrative that's coming from management where they're focusing on what they think might be more useful, and maybe more habit-forming purchases for their customers. For me, I want to see orders moving a little bit faster than 3%. That's where I'm getting stuck.
Feroldi: I think that's a completely fair thing to look for. Optionality is great when it can augment the existing business. Optionality isn't great when it's, hey, we have all these other things that we could do because our core business isn't doing what we want it to do. To me, Jumia is in the latter camp right now. Sure, they have lots of potential growth irons on the fire, but I want to see the core business rocking and rolling before I care about those other things.
Lewis: Brian, we talked about three different companies today, you don't own any of them. I'm going to put you on the spot here. If you had to force rank them, what would your No. 2 be?
Feroldi: My No. 2 would be Lemonade for sure. To me, I look at Jumia and I just think the company is just not showing me anything that makes this compelling, especially when you think about all the other e-commerce companies that are out there in the world that are just thriving. Some of those companies are putting up 50%, 60%, 70% customer growth and revenue growth. When you compare that to Jumia, it's clear to me that they are still struggling. Without knowing the question, I answered a little too early. I thought you were going to say, ""Which one is your favorite?""
Lewis: That's always dangerous.
Feroldi: But to me, No. 1, Olo, by far, I still can't wrap my head around Lemonade, so that would be No. 2, and then a distant third would be Jumia. But how about you, Dylan?
Lewis: Yes, I think I would put Lemonade and Jumia in a similar footing. Like I said, they're both on the watch list for a different reason. I think the path is a lot clearer for a company like Lemonade. We talked about it before. The term story in the fragmented insurance market, it's right for disruption and people want to be delighted in that space in a way that they're not currently being delighted. I think that path forward is a lot easier for them. Jumia, I think the upside is incredible if they're able to execute. We've seen the story play out. Being a MercadoLibre's shareholder, being an Amazon shareholder, I've been rewarded for buying into e-commerce thesis before. I need a couple more signs that that thesis is on track before I buy in.
Feroldi: Jumia is a $2.5 billion company. If this company really started to execute well and put up the growth numbers that we want, and you still bought into it when it was a $10 billion company, that to me doesn't matter because if this thesis is work, what could it be worth? This could be a $100+ billion idea in time, maybe even more, so I would not think that, man, I missed this if I didn't invest now. But I want to see clear signs that this model is working wonders before I would even consider putting it on my radar.
Lewis: That's exactly right, and we talk about it all the time. I'm happy to trade some upside for a little bit more certainty, and there are other people who are happy to take on a little bit more risk, and maybe that's where this is already in their portfolio. But if I start to see that certainty manifest, I'm going to be pretty interested in the upside.
Feroldi: Fair enough. There's a lot to like there.
Lewis: All right, Brian, thank you so much for joining me as always. Hope you have an awesome weekend.
Feroldi: You too, Dylan.

(NASDAQ:EBAY) For Its Upcoming Dividend,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-you-might-be-interested-in-ebay-inc.-nasdaq%3Aebay-for-its-upcoming-dividend-2021-05-24,,,"Readers hoping to buy eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY) for its dividend will need to make their move shortly, as the stock is about to trade ex-dividend. Typically, the ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date which is the date on which a company determines the shareholders eligible to receive a dividend. It is important to be aware of the ex-dividend date because any trade on the stock needs to have been settled on or before the record date. Therefore, if you purchase eBay's shares on or after the 28th of May, you won't be eligible to receive the dividend, when it is paid on the 18th of June.
The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.18 per share, and in the last 12 months, the company paid a total of US$0.72 per share. Calculating the last year's worth of payments shows that eBay has a trailing yield of 1.2% on the current share price of $61.02. If you buy this business for its dividend, you should have an idea of whether eBay's dividend is reliable and sustainable. We need to see whether the dividend is covered by earnings and if it's growing.
Dividends are usually paid out of company profits, so if a company pays out more than it earned then its dividend is usually at greater risk of being cut. eBay paid out just 17% of its profit last year, which we think is conservatively low and leaves plenty of margin for unexpected circumstances. Yet cash flow is typically more important than profit for assessing dividend sustainability, so we should always check if the company generated enough cash to afford its dividend. It paid out 19% of its free cash flow as dividends last year, which is conservatively low.
It's positive to see that eBay's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut.

NasdaqGS:EBAY Historic Dividend May 24th 2021
Have Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?
Businesses with strong growth prospects usually make the best dividend payers, because it's easier to grow dividends when earnings per share are improving. If earnings decline and the company is forced to cut its dividend, investors could watch the value of their investment go up in smoke. For this reason, we're glad to see eBay's earnings per share have risen 19% per annum over the last five years. Earnings per share have been growing rapidly and the company is retaining a majority of its earnings within the business. Fast-growing businesses that are reinvesting heavily are enticing from a dividend perspective, especially since they can often increase the payout ratio later.
Many investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. In the last two years, eBay has lifted its dividend by approximately 13% a year on average. It's great to see earnings per share growing rapidly over several years, and dividends per share growing right along with it.
To Sum It Up
Has eBay got what it takes to maintain its dividend payments? We love that eBay is growing earnings per share while simultaneously paying out a low percentage of both its earnings and cash flow. These characteristics suggest the company is reinvesting in growing its business, while the conservative payout ratio also implies a reduced risk of the dividend being cut in the future. It's a promising combination that should mark this company worthy of closer attention.
While it's tempting to invest in eBay for the dividends alone, you should always be mindful of the risks involved. In terms of investment risks, we've identified 2 warning signs with eBay and understanding them should be part of your investment process.
A common investment mistake is buying the first interesting stock you see. Here you can find a list of promising dividend stocks with a greater than 2% yield and an upcoming dividend.

2021-05-21 00:00:00+00:00,Big European states warm to U.S. proposal for minimum corporate tax rate of at least 15%,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/big-european-states-warm-to-u.s.-proposal-for-minimum-corporate-tax-rate-of-at-least-15,,,"By Michael Nienaber and David Lawder
LISBON, May 21 (Reuters) - France, Germany and Italy said on Friday that a new U.S. proposal for global minimum corporate tax rate of at least 15% was a good basis for sealing an international deal by July.
The U.S. Treasury Department offered on Thursday to accept a minimum rate of at least 15%, significantly below its proposed 21% minimum for U.S. multinational firms.
It made the proposal at the Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) where nearly 140 countries aim to reach broad agreement this summer to rework rules for taxing multinational groups and big technology companies, such as Alphabet Inc GOOGL.O and Facebook Inc FB.O.
""Treasury proposed to the steering group that the global minimum tax rate should be at least 15%,"" the department said in a statement. ""Treasury underscored that 15% is a floor and that discussions should continue to be ambitious and push that rate higher.""
U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen first proposed a 21% U.S. corporate minimum tax in April as part of President Joe Biden's $2.2 trillion infrastructure spending proposal, which would be financed largely by increasing the U.S. corporate tax rate to 28%.
The Trump administration and congressional Republicans in 2017 cut the corporate tax rate to 21% from 35%. At the same time, the Treasury launched a U.S. minimum tax, of 10.5%, known as the Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income tax (GILTI) to capture revenue shifted by companies to tax-haven countries.
The Biden administration's proposed 21% GILTI rate was widely viewed as a starting point for renewed OECD talks on a global minimum tax.
While France and Germany backed the 21%, other countries have pushed for a lower rate, as previous OECD discussions on the subject had centered around 12.5%, the same rate charged by Ireland.
""The last proposal made by the United States could be a good compromise,"" French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said as he arrived for talks with euro zone counterparts in Lisbon.
His German counterpart Olaf Scholz welcomed the new U.S. proposal as ""big progress"" and EU Economics Commissioner Paolo Gentiloni said it was a step forward to a deal, as did Italian Economy Minister Daniele Franco.
All hoped that talks would be wrapped up as planned by a July meeting of G20 finance ministers, amid suggestions from the OECD that it could take until October to finalize a deal.
While Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe did not address the issue publicly in Lisbon, he reiterated in a pre-recorded interview for an online event his opposition to a ""high"" minimum tax and said September and October would be the key period for getting a deal.
Two euro zone officials at the meeting in Lisbon said that the U.S. offer would find wide backing in the broader European Union. ""That 15% will be acceptable for all EU member states, including Luxembourg and Ireland,"" one of the officials said.
Britain, which is due to host an online meeting of finance ministers next week, remains concerned that the latest U.S. proposals do not address the challenge of ensuring large multinationals, especially tech companies, pay more tax in countries where they generate revenue.
""MORE REALISTIC""
A U.S. Treasury official said the Biden administration will continue to advocate for the highest rate possible above 15%, adding that the offer does not alter the 21% proposed U.S. minimum tax.
The official said that even at 15%, the spread between U.S. and global minimum rates would narrow considerably, because there currently is no global minimum tax.
""The 15% rate is certainly more realistic given where other countries are,"" said Manal Corwin, head of KPMG's Washington National Tax practice and a former Treasury official.
""Importantly, this is signaling that the U.S. is willing to accept a global minimum tax that is well below the rate they are proposing for GILTI,"" she added. ""I suspect it was important for reaching agreement at the OECD that the U.S. is willing to agree to something well below 21%.""
The Treasury Department proposed the global minimum tax as a way to minimize the impact of a higher U.S. tax rate on the competitiveness of American companies and deter them from shifting operations or profits to lower-tax jurisdictions.

If only there was a way to go back in time and buy shares of a company leading that transformation. In some ways, MarketAxess actually is that time machine.
Fixed income, otherwise known as bonds, has historically been an inefficient manual process with traders settling on a price over the phone. It's a huge market, and MarketAxess is bringing it into the 21st century with its electronic bond trading platform. That trend, along with pristine financials and management's approach to capital allocation, are why I won't sell my position no matter how far the market falls.

An amazing track record
Founder and CEO Rick McVey has generated the types of returns investors dream about. Since 2010, the stock is up 3,410%. That made it one of the best performers of the decade. Like many industries, the bond market saw a lot of activity shift online during the pandemic, and the extra volume highlighted how well the company scales. Every dollar of additional revenue produced more and more profit.
METRIC 2015 TO 2019 2020
Revenue growth 14% 35%
Operating income growth 16% 49%
Data source: Morningstar.
The company carries no debt and is as profitable as some of the brands best known for connecting buyers and sellers through a technology platform. Simply put, it's an outstanding business.
COMPANY 2020 OPERATING MARGIN 2020 RETURN ON INVESTED CAPITAL 2020 RETURN ON ASSETS

Visa (NYSE: V) 65% 22% 14%
eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY) 27% 51% 30%
Data source: Morningstar.
McVey also has an excellent record of allocating capital. MarketAxess pays a dividend of $0.66 per quarter. The 0.6% yield may not get income investors excited, but the payout has grown 25% annually since being introduced at the end of 2009. The company has also made high-quality strategic acquisitions. In 2019, it bought LiquidityEdge to enter the U.S. Treasury market. The move opened up nearly $600 billion in daily trading volume. Last year, management added Regulatory Reporting Hub for its infrastructure in Europe. That move continues the buildout of a services arm and helps add value across the entire trading lifecycle for clients.
A surprisingly large opportunity remains
The value of existing government and corporate debt is more than $100 trillion. Management estimates the U.S. market alone has about $50 trillion outstanding. The company's volume growth over the past five years shows how fast all categories of debt are shifting online. In fact, MarketAxess has increased overall market share in every quarter since the beginning of 2009. There is a lot of incentive for the growth to keep going. Some dealers estimate electronic trading is 10% to 30% cheaper than traditional voice trades.
TYPE OF BOND MARKETAXESS VOLUME FIVE-YEAR CAGR
U.S. high-grade 19%
U.S. high-yield 28%
Emerging market 31%
Eurobonds 32%
Data source: MarketAxess. CAGR = compound annual growth rate.
Cost isn't the only reason the trades are going online. The large fixed-income market is also being driven by regulatory trends. After the financial crisis, a number of regulations were introduced to increase transparency and reduce systemic risk. The trading platform allows price discovery for participants and dramatically improves liquidity, both of which suffer when relying on relationships and phone calls to connect buyer to seller. That regulation was one of the drivers for the stock's incredible gains over the past decade. However, large segments of the industry still operate in a relationship-driven environment.
That leaves plenty of growth ahead for MarketAxess. For example, even though the percentage of European fixed income that traded electronically rose from 38% to 45% last year, it's still miles behind some other assets. For comparison, 90% of trading in the currency market is digital.
Don't interrupt the compounding
In the recently reported first quarter, the company generated record revenue that was 16% higher than last year. That's impressive considering last year's first quarter contained more than a month of extremely elevated credit market activity as the pandemic set in. That tough comparison may be a reason the stock is almost 24% below its recent high.
Many analyses have shown the best investments are ones that compound for decades. Yet one of the hardest things to do in investing is nothing. That's precisely what is required to let that compounding work. That's why I bought one of the best businesses around and plan to hold it for as long as I can.

2021-05-21 00:00:00+00:00,3 Things In-the-Know Investors Have Learned About eBay Stock,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-things-in-the-know-investors-have-learned-about-ebay-stock-2021-05-21,,,"eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY) doesn't get as much attention as other top e-commerce stocks, and it's understandable. Before and during the pandemic, eBay didn't post the impressive growth rates of companies like Etsy and Shopify.
However, shares of eBay have quietly outperformed the broad market over the last five years, and that trend has continued in 2021. Year to date, the stock is up 19% as of this writing, beating the S&P 500 return of 10%.
There are three things that stand out from eBay's first-quarter earnings report that explain why its stock has outperformed and why it may continue to do so.

1. Improved volume growth
Before the pandemic, eBay posted a 5% decline in gross merchandise volume (GMV) in 2019. Given that weak showing, it's understandable the stock sold for a relatively low forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 11 at the time.
But last year, GMV growth accelerated to as high as 26% in the second quarter. That number decelerated in the second half of the year before picking back up in the latest report with a growth rate of 29%.
eBay expects to report lower growth in the current period as it laps a strong showing in the year-ago quarter, but it is still impressive that management expects to report revenue growth between 12% to 14% year over year.
Now, eBay trades for about 16 times forward earnings estimates, which is a bargain if eBay can sustain its recent volume gains beyond the pandemic.
There are a few reasons it can.
2. New category expansion
Management has been investing in new product categories that are already driving high volume growth.
eBay's recent expansion into authenticated sneakers and luxury watches has been very successful. In the first quarter, sales of sneakers valued above $100 grew at a triple-digit rate for the second quarter in a row.
""In luxury watches, we saw growth accelerate from 16% in Q4 to 38% in Q1 in the U.S.,"" CEO Jamie Iannone said during the first-quarter earnings call.
The market for secondhand luxury goods and sneakers has been hot in recent years. For example, StockX is a popular marketplace to buy and sell authenticated sneakers, which recently saw its valuation jump 35% from December to $3.8 billion.
All said, eBay's marketing capabilities and early success in these markets could go a long way toward revitalizing its brand image with younger shoppers.
3. Selling non-core businesses
Investors might also be overlooking the tremendous value eBay is unlocking by selling off non-core businesses.
In Feb. 2020, eBay completed the sale of StubHub for $4.05 billion in cash. Management took those proceeds and repurchased nearly the same amount of shares in the first quarter of 2020.
The company is currently in the process of selling its Classifieds business to Adevinta for a combination of stock and cash worth $12.7 billion. eBay is also exploring options for its Korean online marketplace, Gmarket, which it acquired in 2009 for $1.2 billion.
It also holds a warrant to acquire up to 5% of leading payment platform Adyen at a specified date. At the end of the first quarter, this warrant was worth $1 billion, representing an increase in value of $700 million since eBay acquired it in 2018.
Regarding the deals with Adevinta and Adyen, Iannone said: ""We remain excited about both of these investments, the optionality they provide, and the significant value each can generate for our shareholders.""
Investors are underestimating eBay
eBay could run into some problems in the near term as it laps the growth from 2020, but the stock's low valuation may already account for that scenario.
Analysts currently expect eBay to grow earnings per share at a compounded annual rate of 10% over the long term. With the asset sales, category expansion, and improved GMV growth, the stock has a lot to offer at a forward P/E of less than 16. It even pays a dividend yielding 1.2%.
Overall, adding shares of eBay to your portfolio can serve as a good hedge for someone looking to diversify against high-P/E growth stocks that have fallen out of favor in 2021.

Another jittery week seems to be upon the markets as news headlines highlight inflation expectations and short-term profit-taking in equities. After months of significant returns, many market participants are now nervous as they wonder where stocks may be headed next.
But for young investors with time on their side, it is a different story. They do not need to be concerned with such short-term volatility as long as they have robust companies in their long-term portfolios. Therefore, today I’d like to discuss the leading financial technology (fintech) firm PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL). I regard PYPL stock as one of the best companies to buy and hold forever.
Wall Street regards the fintech industry, where technology helps optimize financial services and banking, as a great disruptor. The pandemic of the past year has clearly accelerated the digitalization trend in online payments.
A recent joint study by the World Bank, Cambridge University, and World Economic Forum “reveals a global FinTech industry that has been largely resilient in spite of COVID-19.” Recent metrics further highlight, “Mobile payments are expected to grow at a rapid pace in the next five years, registering a 250 percent increase in revenue from 2020 to 2025.”

7 Industrial Stocks to Buy for a Rock-Solid Foundation
PayPal, one of the most important fintech leaders, is highly profitable and truly global in scope. Analysts expect the group to keep on innovating and successfully dominating the digital payment space. Therefore, potential investors could regard any drop in PYPL stock as an opportunity to buy the shares. Let’s see why.
Fintech and PYPL Stock
PayPal was set up by several investors, including Peter Thiel who has also co-founded Palantir (NASDAQ:PLTR), in 1998. At the time, it was called Confinity. Meanwhile around the same timeframe, Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), became one of the founders of X.com.
In 2000, the two companies merged en route to becoming a leader in the online payments space. The new entity was called PayPal. Later that year, Musk left the company. In the following months, eBay  (NASDAQ:EBAY) became the key platform where PayPal increased its userbase.
Finally, in 2002, eBay acquired PayPal. Following over a decade of massive growth, eBay decided to spin off PayPal. PYPL stock joined Nasdaq in July 2015 at an opening price shy of $40.
In about two decades, PayPal has become one of the most important names in fintech. Its payment solutions include its namesake Paypal, the popular Venmo and others. Moreover, United States-based users can also trade Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD) on the platform. It now offers a  “Checkout with Crypto” service for U.S. customers who can use crypto holdings to pay online merchants.  
In summary, since 1998, the company has proven to be a winner. It currently has about 400 million active accounts. Several other metrics show how the company dominates online payments. The average user checks out with Paypal about 40 times every year. PayPal accounts for 22% of online transactions in the U.S., and is also among the top names in the European fintech industry.
How PayPal’s Recent Earnings Came
On May 5, PayPal released record first-quarter results. Total Payment Volume (TPV) grew 50% year-over-year (YOY) to $285 billion. Net revenue came at $6.03 billion, increasing 31%. 
Non-GAAP operating income of $1.67 billion meant an increase of 84% YOY. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.22, also up 84%. Cash flow generated from operations grew 24% YOY to $1.76 billion, and free cash flow was up 27%, reaching $1.54 billion.
In Q1, the company repurchased approximately 5.3 million shares of common stock, returning $1.3 billion to stockholders. The strong results showed increasing revenues, a robust balance sheet and impressive cash-flow generation.
“Our strong first quarter results demonstrate sustained momentum in our business as the world shifts into the digital economy,” said CEO Dan Schulman. “Our addressable market continues to grow as we launch new products and services for our 392 million active accounts.”
In the past 12 months, PYPL stock is up 67% and hit an all-time high (ATH) of $309.14 in mid-February. Since then, it has given up some of the recent gains and is currently hovering around $245. Its market capitalization (cap) stands at $280 billion.
The stock’s forward price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-book (P/B) ratios stand at 54.05, 12.80 and 14.88, respectively. These numbers point to an overstretched valuation by historical standards. Therefore, PYPL stock is likely to come under further short-term pressure in the coming weeks.
However, for retail investors, and even for experienced traders, bottom-picking is difficult. Buy-and-hold investors could regard any further drop in the PayPal share price as an opportunity to invest for the long term.
The Bottom Line on PYPL Stock
PayPal is the most popular online payment services stateside as well as in many European countries. It is also a solid growth company. Therefore, long-term investors could consider buying the dips in PYPL stock.
For those investors who prefer not to commit all their capital to a single stock like PayPal, an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that provides exposure to PYPL could be an interesting alternative.
Examples include the ARK Fintech Innovation ETF (NYSEARCA:ARKF), the ETFMG Prime Mobile Payments ETF (NYSEARCA:IPAY), the Global X FinTech ETF (NASDAQ:FINX), the Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ), the iShares U.S. Industrials ETF (CBOE:IYJ), the Simplify Volt Fintech Disruption ETF (NYSEARCA:VFIN), tand the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSEARCA:SPY).

*Stock Advisor returns as of May 11, 2021
This video was recorded on May 7, 2021.
Chris Hill: It's the Motley Fool Money radio show. I'm Chris Hill. Joining me this week, Senior Analysts Jason Moser and Emily Flippen. Good to see you both.
Jason Moser: Howdy.
Emily Flippen: Good to be here, Chris.
Hill: We've got the latest headlines from Wall Street. We'll talk about real estate investing with our man, Matt Argersinger. As always, we've got a couple of stocks on our radar. But we begin with one of the darlings of the stay-at-home stocks, and that's Peloton. Third-quarter revenue grew 141% for Peloton. That would be the headline if not for the fact that on Wednesday, Peloton announced the recall of all of its treadmills after reports the devices have caused dozens of injuries and one death. CEO John Foley publicly apologized and said the company made a mistake in not reacting more quickly to the Consumer Products Safety Commission's calls for action. Emily, how bad is this right now for Peloton?
Flippen: Well, it's bad enough to say, Chris, are you sure you want to start with this story? [laughs] They are wasting no time here. This is probably the biggest news story of the week. One that lots of investors are losing a lot of money over. Peloton shares have lost nearly $5 billion in market value since the announcement of the Tread Plus and Tread recalls. It's so true that if you had just looked at this quarter without hearing any of the news about the threads and their recalls, it actually looked pretty good. They drove up connected fitness memberships by over 400,000 members. They had the lowest net monthly churn rate that they've seen in 6+ years. Truly an outstanding quarter in virtually every engagement metric, but really overshadowed by this poor management issue, I think is the best way we can describe it. The recall itself is probably something that hearkens back to Chipotle and the E-coli. It's hopefully something that's going to pass for this business. But the way that management handled this situation, coming out with aggressive statements and then only days later, really backtracking, doing a complete 180 and issuing a full recall for both treadmills, it really is something that I think has shaken a lot of investors.
Hill: Yeah. I can't decide if Foley's admission that they didn't act quickly enough is a good thing or not. But it still seems like beyond the recall of the threads, they still have some work to do in terms of their messaging, their marketing, and how they're going to make this better.
Flippen: They certainly do and they are coming out with some software updates that's going to make the treadmill harder to turn on without an approved adult in the room. Hopefully, it'll decrease the risk to pets and children, so they're making those improvements. But you only get one chance to make the improvement. If Peloton says they've improved the design, whether that be adding a slat underneath the treadmill itself, whether that be doing software updates, you cannot have any more injuries. You can not have the Consumer Product Safety Commission coming after you a second time. Investors and consumers will not forgive that more than once.
Hill: PayPal's first-quarter results were unsurprisingly strong. Profits, revenue, and payment volume were all up. About the only thing that wasn't up was PayPal stock, shares down about 2% despite this glowing report.
Moser: Well, I mean, it depends on your timeline. It is up technically, I mean, if you're talking about one day, all right, I get it. But this is a $300 billion company now, which is just astounding really to think about it, and even more amazing to me. At this point in the game, Chris, this one, it is not too big to own. This is still one that you need to own and this is a company that is coming now off of its strongest first quarter ever in the company's history. Just to sum up the numbers that you mentioned, total payment volume, $285 billion, that's up 46% excluding currency effects. This is a company operating on a $1 trillion rate now through that total payment volume network. Excluding eBay, it starts to look even better. I mean, if you look at eBay now, it's just 5.5% of total volume and that'll be 3.5% by years in. That just means they are basically eliminating that eBay risk from the business model. Revenue up 29% to just over $6 billion, non-GAAP earnings per share almost doubled to $1.22, 14.5 million accounts added. They now have 392 million active accounts bringing up 4.4 billion transactions for the quarter, up 34%. Take rate continues to feel a little bit of a pressure there as costs come down, as Venmo becomes a larger part of the business. Again, that's not a surprise, something we fully expected.
Raised guidance across the board, looking at close to $26 billion in revenue for the full year and earnings of $4.70. Now, that puts shares at better than 50 times full-year estimates. Again, a proven business brings in plenty of cash, very profitable. I mean, it seems to me to be one of those high-quality businesses that every investor needs to consider keeping in their portfolio. One final note, because this is still such a new offering, but the buy now pay later space, which is really starting to take hold, PayPal has done a tremendous job of introducing this feature to their model. They've processed over $1 billion in total payment volume with their BNPL offerings. They did note some interesting statistics here, 50% of the customers who have used BNPL have repeated that within three months, and 70% of them have repeated that offer within six months. Clearly, a new feature they've introduced that PayPal users are very fond of.
Hill: Just real quick. CEO Dan Schulman teased out this next-generation digital wallet. Do you have a sense of when that's going to happen because it seems like it's later this year?
Moser: It's difficult to say, I mean, they've been talking about this for a while. There's this term coined Super App between analysts and even PayPal management. I mean, they are working on something big. I think we'll start to see the signs of how this is taking shape, yeah, later in the year, but I suspect it will be something that rolls out more fully in 2022.
Hill: Shares of Activision Blizzard up a bit this week after first-quarter profits and revenue both came in higher than expected. The video game maker also raised guidance for the full fiscal year. I know Activision Blizzard makes a lot of games, Emily, but the Call of Duty franchise just continues to deliver for this business.
Flippen: Let's talk about that for a second because every single time I look at Activision's quarter, I ask myself, ""Okay, when are the Call of Duty people dropping off, because you can only play one game for so long."" But Activision has managed to continuously engage this audience, provide updates, and provide expansions on this Call of Duty line. They had a record 150 million monthly active users just for Call of Duty last quarter, which I still have a hard time wrapping my head around. I don't mean to take away from Activision's quarter, it was absolutely amazing. It's one of the few companies that is actually being rewarded this earnings season. But I always ask myself, what are they going to do with Blizzard? It feels like Blizzard is this problem child for Activision Blizzard. It's really going to need to do a better job of bringing in lapsed players. There's been a lot of focus on World of Warcraft, the classic relaunch, in particular Burning Crusade, which is coming out soon. Looking at that, they need to do a better job of bringing in the customers the way they have a Call of Duty back to the World of Warcraft and Diablo franchises. They have some stuff in the pipeline that can make this happen, but that's what I'm watching for the future.
Hill: From video games to cybersecurity, Cloudflare's first-quarter revenue was 51% higher than a year ago, but shares are still falling more than 12% this week. Cloudflare is growing, Jason, but they're not growing quite as fast as Wall Street would like.
Moser: Perhaps, but let's also be fair that share drop was based on Fastly's earnings and I think some sentiment regarding the general space. The stock actually responded nicely to these quarterly reports. Let's give them a little bit of credit here, Chris. Yeah, I mean, true to your point, Wall Street always wants them to grow a little bit at a faster rate, especially when they're not making a whole heck of a lot of money. But for me, when you're looking for leaders employing that Jeff Bezos mindset of constant innovation, it's impossible for me to imagine not having Cloudflare at the top of the list. To me, this is a team that never stops working to create. Very impressive, the numbers tell us that what they're doing is working. If you look at revenue of $138 million for the quarter, that was up 51%. Dollar-based net retention, 123%, that was up 600 basis points. They added 600,000 paying and free customers. Now, they have a total of over 4.1 million total customers free and paying, that's up 46%. Just over 119,000 paying customers, that's up from a year ago.
Now, I think the key is looking at large customer growth because this is a metric that really matters for this business becoming more and more important. Large customer growth, those customers that are paying $100,000 or more a year for Cloudflare services. They now stand at 945 versus 556 a year ago. But if you dig into a little bit more of that data there, it's those large customers, the $1 million large customer cohort continues to be the fastest-growing cohort of that large customer cohort. When you talk about those enterprise customers, those large customers, that's more than half of the business's total revenue now. This is becoming a more and more important part of the business. When you're signing on large customers like that, that means you're doing a lot of things. That's really what makes Cloudflare, to my mind, such a good investment; its diversity and offerings from application management, content delivery, security, edge computing. I mean, they just do a lot of things and they do them really, really well. I suspect that's going to continue. Matthew Prince, just one of the co-founders of the business, CEO, a great follow on Twitter because you'll learn so much of what he's thinking about. But all in all, I mean, this is a business that's doing what I hoped it would do when I recommended it several months back.
Hill: Beyond Meat's loss in the first quarter was more than double what was expected. Throw in the fact that management is not offering guidance for the year, and shares of Beyond Meat down more than 10% this week, Emily.
Flippen: You make it seem so bad, Chris, and maybe [laughs] I'm a Beyond Meat apologist, so bear with me. But I didn't think this quarter was that bad. A lot of the negative news that Beyond Meat's getting is a bit out of its control, especially as it applies to its foodservice revenue from the pandemic, and the part that is within its control, I actually think they are executing really well on. Despite missing in both terms of profit and in revenue, I do think foodservice turning around over the next year could be a genuine catalyst. Pre-pandemic food service, that's your restaurant, your fast-food chains, etc., it was nearly half of Beyond Meat's revenue. That's fallen now to a quarter. That gives you some perspective about just how much the avenues for distribution fell off as a result of COVID. But even with this retail revenue, so that's individual people buying it from their grocery stores, it was up 26% domestically and 189% internationally over the last quarter. The demand for meat alternatives is still there. You'll see people pointing to heightening competition. Tyson Foods announced recently that they're making their own plant-based burger. But that just says to me that even Tyson sees the writing on the wall as it applies to plant alternatives, and Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods for that matter, have the edge, because they have businesses solely focused on serving this market. In addition to initiatives for plant-based chicken coming up hopefully over the near future, the Beyond Burger 3.0, there were a lot of things coming out recently, that make me excited to be a Beyond Meat investor.
Hill: Square's first-quarter report was a lot like PayPal's, strong profits, revenue growth, increased transactions. Just like PayPal, Jason, Square stock's down a bit this week.
Moser: We can beat or argue as to why that would be the case. Clearly, a lot of growth has been pulled forward in both of these companies. We talked about PayPal being now a $300 billion company. It's really impressive to see that Square is a $100 billion company. I mean, again, these are companies that made very early bets in the way that money is moving, in the way that commerce is being transacted. These bets are really starting to pay off. When you look at Square, this is really about sellers and it's about the Cash App. It's about their merchant partners, these small businesses all over the country, in the world really, to an extent, they're providing just a valuable service. If you look at the numbers, it's just very impressive. Net revenue for the business, it was just over $5 billion, it was up to 266%. That's a WOW number.
Now, let's pull that Bitcoin revenue out first though, Chris. That gives you a little bit of a more realistic picture. I think net revenue without Bitcoin was $1.55 billion, that was up 44%. Still very impressive. Gross profit, $964 million. That was up 79%. Gross payment volume of $33.1 billion through their networks. That was up 29% as well. Speaking of that seller ecosystem in the core, the seller ecosystem generated just a little bit over one billion dollars in revenue, $468 million in gross profit that was at 19% and 32% respectively. Then looking at Cash App again, I mean, they just continue to find new ways to monetize it. It's a sticky app that keeps people in there. They introduce new services to it. Cash App net revenue just over $4 billion, with $495 million in gross profit. Now, let's, again, pull out the Bitcoin because that does matter. You exclude Bitcoin, and now we're talking about $529 million of revenue. That was up 127%. They generated around $3.5 billion in Bitcoin revenue in Cash App for the core. What does this business look like without Bitcoin? I'm not really sure, we've framed some numbers there. I think that Bitcoin really is just an ancillary part of the story. It goes back to ultimately, all of the different things that you can do with Cash App and the value that they continue to provide to that seller network. That's going to be the story for this company for the foreseeable future which makes me very encouraged.
Hill: First quarter profits and revenue from Match Group were higher than Wall Street was expecting. This is the parent company of Match.com, Tinder, and other dating apps. CEO Shar Dubey said that as more people get vaccinated, she is, ""looking forward to a summer of love."" Emily, how excited should shareholders be?
Flippen: I think shareholders should be really excited. I could point to the 23% growth in revenue for the most recent quarter, a 12% growth in average subscribers, in the most recent quarter, all of those things are great, but I think the big question is, OK, well they had a really weird 2020 that ended up being wonderful for their business as people flooded to online dating apps to get any sort of social connection in the pandemic. Do people continue to pay for many services that Match Group offers, even as they go out more and more often? I think both of those numbers, in addition to the average revenue per user, rising over their most recent quarter, is a resounding yes.
Hill: Shares of Etsy down more than 15% this week. Despite the fact that first-quarter profits and revenue were both solidly higher than expected. Jason, you look at Etsy's revenue, the number of buyers on the platform, the number of sellers on the platform, all of those numbers are going in the direction you would want if you were a shareholder.
Moser: They are. As a shareholder, I remain very pleased with what the business is doing. I think this is a time where you really need to remain focused on the business. Don't worry so much about how the market is reacting to what was clearly a very good report. I mean, when we look at the numbers, I think, that tells you all you really need to know. But consolidated gross merchandise sales, $3.1 billion. It was up 132% from a year ago. Gross merchandise sales per active buyer grew 20% revenue better than 140%. They now have 4.7 million active sellers in 90.6 million active buyers in their net worth. Those numbers were up 67% and 90% respectively. This is becoming a mobile story, Chris, it is able to really make that pivot to the mobile environment, mobile gross merchandise sales, that's up to 63% of the total now, that was from 58 just a year ago. Then you've got the other little parts of the business that are starting to become more meaningful. Etsy payments, that revenue was up 156%, they processed 92% of Etsy stand-alone gross merchandise sales through Etsy payments in the quarter. They're not offering any full-year guidance that probably has the market on edge. The stock is trading around 46 times full-year street estimates. Not cheap, but a very high-quality business, and one more thing and onto.
Hill: Whether it's rising home prices or the focus on which businesses will be going back to their office buildings, real estate is one of the hottest topics in the financial world these days, and there is no one, I would rather hear from than Matt Argersinger, he's a Lead Investor for Millionacres, The Motley Fool's real estate investing service, and he joins me now from, where else, his home. Matt, good to see you.
Argersinger: Hey, good to see you, Chris.
Hill: There's a lot of things with commercial real estate I want to get to, but I have to start just quickly with residential real estate. Because I don't know about you, but I am talking to and hearing from friends all over the country who are running into or dealing with an incredibly hot real estate market. What is going on with home prices right now? Is this going to continue for the rest of the year or, at some point, this has to cool off, right?
Argersinger: [laughs] Chris, I've been hearing the same things and reading about the same things and I don't know if it ends anytime soon just because I think what we're dealing with here is really a demand-supply imbalance of really epic proportions. All the way back to the previous housing boom. Sort of 2005, '06, '07 era. We were building about 1.5 million new homes in this country every year post-crisis. So we had the financial crisis and recession. The last decade we've been building about 600,000 a year. You can make a credible argument. Now, maybe we were overbuilding in our last boom, but we even undoubtedly underbuilt over the last 10 years during this current economic cycle. You can make a credible argument that we should have about five million more houses in existence today than we actually do. As you're seeing report after report of just every market, it seems record low inventories and a house comes on the market, it's on the market for maybe two or three days, it gets 10 offers. You're speaking of conversations with friends; I have a friend, he and his wife, they're having their second child, and they're looking to buy a larger house in the DC area. They currently live in a two-bedroom condo and they've been making offers pretty much the past six to nine months. They made an offer the other day on a house that was 10% above asking with no contingencies attached. Their offer wasn't even in the top five [laughs] according to their agent. That's where we are with the supply side. We've just underbuilt homes.
On the demand side, why are people looking for homes? Well, you have record low interest rates. You have a huge cohort of people now in their late 20s, early 30s who are looking to buy their first home. Maybe they're having a family and looking to settle down. Then on top of all that, of course, we had the pandemic. You had this huge surge of people looking for larger homes or homes with yards and maybe outside of the city. There's just not a lot of those homes out there. There's the demand side and you kind of asked me when it's going to stop. I don't know if this stops anytime soon because one of the solutions is, well, how do you fix the supply problem? You build more homes. Most of the home builders are building homes as fast as they profitably can, and that's the key word, I want to emphasize profitably. What's happened when you look at lumber prices, copper prices, cement prices I saw the other day are at historical highs. Can they build a home profitably and right now and a lot of markets, they actually can't. You even have the home builders who are pulling back from building houses, and so I just think this demand-supply imbalance will remain for a while.
Hill: Let's move on to office buildings. Where do you think we are now? Because you've got some large companies coming out and saying they are getting their people back to work as close to 100% as possible. So it doesn't seem to be the crisis that a lot of people predicted 12 months ago, but I'm curious how much you think it's going to bounce back.
Argersinger: That's right. I think we were in a much better place with the office today. There's a lot more clarity in the market. I think 12 months ago, it was just, ""We'll never go back to the office."" Everyone's going to work from home, and now you're going to have vacant office buildings everywhere in all these cities and that's not the case. A lot of big companies have decided they're bringing a lot of their workforce back or at least are bringing them back in kind of a hybrid three days on, two days off or some other flexible nature. I actually don't think the demand for office space, the space itself is actually going to decline as much as people thought. I think it's more of a question about how we're going to be using office space in the future. Is it more of a collaborative space? Is it more open? It's certainly going to hopefully, in a lot of places, be a lot more safer and sanitary. I do think the office mark is going to bounce back. I think there are some places like New York City, for example, where it just went down too fast.
A lot of the office valuations went down and a lot of that occupancy that went down so much, it's going to bounce back. I think it's led by a lot of the companies like Goldman Sachs or JP Morgan's of the world or Googles [Alphabet] of the world, they are saying. There's just a collaborative culture aspect of being in the office that is superior to being at home. That doesn't mean there's going to be 100% return to the office for all the company, no way. But it's going to bounce back, I think a lot stronger and probably almost get back to where we were pre-pandemic. Not quite, but almost.
Hill: One of the big stories in the investing world over the past 12 months has been not just the rise of e-commerce, but the ways in which traditional bricks and mortar retailers, including Walmart and Target and Costco, have ramped up their delivery and digital sales. When you look at malls, when you look at the retail landscape, what do you think we're going to see over the next five years?
Argersinger: Yeah, this might be a boring answer, but I think the next five years is going to look very much like the last [laughs] five years, which is so irrespective of the pandemic and what's happened there, we're already seeing a sort of slow-paced evolution from pure retail to what I would call your experience-based retail or your mixed-use retail, which it's no longer the idea of I'm going to the mall, just to go shopping. Or I'm going into that department store, I'm going to that strip mall. I need a real reason to go to places like that now. This was already happening. More people are adopting online shopping and getting comfortable with online shopping. That just accelerated last year and into this year. There's just millions more people now they're shopping really extensively online to include buying fresh fruit and groceries, and getting restaurant-quality food. I think what you're going to see is in order for traditional retail to exist, it's got to sort of coexist with other offerings. Services, entertainment venues, mixed-use properties that have multi-family apartment buildings and hotels and also retail. Or there's just drastic transformations, and this is happening to where you're seeing entire malls turn into data centers or warehouse space, because that's just a very efficient use for that type of real estate. You've got lots of parking. You've got structures that are very easy to adapt and utility systems that are easy to replace, and so there's no surprise that companies like Amazon or your Digital Realty Trust of the world or even your FedEx and UPS are taking over law of that real estate and transforming them into data centers or logistics places.
Hill: Last summer, you were on the show and one of the things you mentioned was the rise of warehouses for all sorts of industries, including restaurants with ghost kitchens and how there are now real estate investment trusts. There are REITs that are focused on warehouses, is this trend continuing?
Argersinger: It's continuing, and last year has to be probably the best year ever for that type of real estate. In fact, one company that I followed for a while, it's called EastGroup Properties. They're primarily a warehouse distribution owner in a lot of places around the Sun Belt of the country, which of course is a lot of those markets. Think of your Dallas, Texas, your Tampa Bay, Florida, just seeing a tremendous amount of population growth and elsewhere. People are flowing to those places, and therefore, the need for e-commerce, the need for more warehouse space is just ballooning. These REITs, Eastgroup Properties is one, Stag Industrial. You mentioned the food and restaurant. There is a REIT called Americold Realty, which is focused almost exclusively on cold storage warehouse space which we need more of. I like this stat I read recently from the CBRE which said that in the United States, we actually need 400 million more square feet of warehouse just to handle returns. In other words, so many more people are shopping online now that we actually need 400 million more square feet of warehouse space just to handle returns that people are making. You can just see that if you're looking at that particular type of real estate, industrial real estate, it's booming. It has been booming, and I see that booming for several more years at least.
Hill: Last thing and then I'll let you go. What are you watching these days? I know you are a very curious investor. You love to dig into all manner of real estate and the stock market. What is under your radar these days?
Argersinger: Sure. Well, one of the things I mentioned was the Sun Belt, and what you're seeing is across the country and you can look at really great data like U-Haul data for example, and you can see where people are moving to and from. You're just seeing in this country a mass migration away from the coast into the inner parts of the country. Funny, Boise, Idaho, is one of the cities that's seeing huge demand. A city like Indianapolis, which I'm sure doesn't show up on anyone's top 10 list of destinations or places they went live, but it's seeing incredible demand. Then the obvious ones like your Austin, Texas of the world, Tampa, Florida, Charlotte, North Carolina. Those cities are really seeing just a big inflow of population and companies also. I like to say real estate follows people and money, and so real estate is really flowing to those places. We mentioned warehouses being underbuilt but so is housing. One of the most fascinating parts for me of the market right now is the rise of single-family rental REITs. Single-family rentals have a new class in residential real estate where you have these fairly large companies that own thousands, if not tens of thousands, of single-family homes that are rentals. Of course, you can imagine post-pandemic, those are in demand because they're affordable but also someone can get a place that doesn't share walls with someone else or a ceiling or floors, and you get a yard in a lot of cases. There's a company called Invitation Homes, for example, which just went public a few years ago. They own tens of thousands of homes in places you want to own them like your Phoenix-es, Arizona, your Texases, your Florida; places where they're seeing a tremendous amount of demand. That part of the market, I think, is a little bit hidden right now and underfollowed, and it's one of those areas that I think is pretty exciting for investors.
Hill: If you want to read more from Matt Argersinger and his team, just go to millionacres.com. Matty, always great talking to you. Thanks for being here.
Argersinger: Thank you so much, Chris.
Hill: Our email address is radio@fool.com. We got a question from Collin in British Columbia. He writes, ""Is tech entering value territory? I was waiting for a pullback, but now I'm nervous to jump in and add up. Stocks like Teladoc Health, Unity Software, and Snowflake are not cheap since they have no earnings. But are we happy with the valuation compared to more average times?"" Jason, I don't know that tech is getting into value territory, but we've certainly seen a pretty dramatic pullback in Nasdaq stocks over the past couple of months.
Moser: Yeah, we absolutely have, and I've said it recently. Honestly, I'm relieved, actually, believe it or not, to see some of this pulling back here. To me, it makes me think that maybe things aren't completely unhinged because you can't get away with 40 times revenue being the normal forever, and we've seen this for a while. There are so many businesses, they don't make any money and yet they're trading at 40 times revenue because, apparently, they're all going to change the world at the same time in their own way. We're going to have some that win some that lose, but for me, again, I go back to what I was talking about with Etsy. Just remember, the stock price isn't the business, and when you talk about companies like Snowflake and Teladoc, and what was the other one, Unity, valuation is going to be one of the bigger risks in the near term with companies like these. They're working toward profitability, investing at a rapid clip, and trying to take as many shares as they can because they have a vision of what they're trying to do. But time will tell whether that vision is correct and they're making wise investments. But that's ultimately the way I approach this. I mean, I agree with you. I don't know that I'd say value territory necessarily. They definitely look a little bit cheaper, and based on the way that businesses are performing, I'm a bit more interested in these businesses to be honest with you because it seems like the businesses are continuing to perform very well. It's just that the valuations are coming a little bit back down to earth.
Hill: Well, and Emily, I definitely identify with Collins, the emotional part of his question, which is, ""Oh, good, they're getting cheaper,"" but then the nervousness of, ""Wait, are they getting cheaper because the valuations are more normal or is something wrong here.""
Flippen: I think if you're looking at just what a normal valuation is, let's say something like a price to sales ratio, something that you can look back or price to earnings ratio, that you can look back at a historical average. A lot of these businesses could still see contractions of 30% or 40%. I think it depends on what you mean by value businesses. If you have a long time horizon, and I'm 26, it's a cheap shot for me to say this, but I'll say it anyway. If you have 30 or 40 years to be investing, then I worry much less about what an average price to sales ratios, what an average PE ratio is because, to me, value is becoming a bigger business, a more relevant business over the very long term. When I look at businesses like Teladoc, and lots of the businesses that we talked about today, like Etsy or Square, great, wonderful businesses that have seen significant haircuts, I view them as value businesses because I have very little doubt in my mind that they are going to be bigger and more relevant over the long term. Now, over the short term, these businesses could certainly see bigger pullbacks. I don't know if they will, but they definitely can.
Hill: We got just a few minutes left. Let's get to the stocks on our radar. Our man behind the glass, Dan Boyd, is going to hit you with a question. Jason Moser, you're up first. What are you looking at this week?
Moser: Man, let's stick with the war on cash. Chris, taking a look at Bill.com, the ticker is B-I-L-L. Remember, this is cloud-based software that digitizes and automates back-office financial operations for small and mid-sized businesses. Just reported earnings. Terrific response to the quarter. Total revenue up 45%. Served 115,600 customers as of the end of the quarter, that was up 27%. Processed $35 billion in total payment volume on the platform. But I think the big news for them, a really big acquisition here, they're going to acquire Divvy for approximately $625 million in cash and almost $2 billion in Bill.com stock. To see the stock performing the way it is after the announcement of such an acquisition, I think is a bit telling, but if you know and like this company called Coupa Software, which we talked about before, then I think you see the potential for this deal in business spend management. It's a massive market opportunity with profound network effects.
Hill: Dan, a question about Bill.com?
Dan Boyd: I don't know if it's a question, Chris, more of a comment. But man, what a great URL. Bill.com, unbelievable. How did they get that?
Moser: I love Dan's not questions but comments. To me, I like this, I like the direction we're headed.
Hill: Emily Flippen, what are you looking at this week?
Flippen: Well, if history says anything, Dan is going to have a savage comment for the company I'm looking at today. That's actually Fiverr. The ticker is F-V-R-R. Investors will be familiar with it as a marketplace for a distributed workforce. Imagine it like Etsy, but instead of selling handmade goods, you're selling your own skills. They had an outstanding quarter. Revenue up 100% year-over-year. Active buyers up 56% year-over-year. Definitely one to keep your eye on.
Hill: Dan, question about Fiverr?
Boyd: Yeah, absolutely. I've used Fiverr a couple of times, and I know this isn't their fault, but every time I try to get something like graphics or something from Fiverr, they're terrible. [laughs] Just god-awful quality coming out of that company. Again, I know it's not their fault, they're just the platform, but I don't know, Emily.
Flippen: I have no words, Dan, other than to say I knew that was coming. I guess I should have known that was coming. I should have been prepared for your answer, but I guess I'm not. I have no response.
Hill: Dan, one of those two you want to add to your watch list?
Boyd: Listen, I am actually a fan of Coupa Software. I'm a stockholder of Coupa. I'm all about the software as a service model, especially for stuff that people just don't want to take care of like bills, so I'm going to go with Bill.com.
Hill: All right.
Flippen: I'm shocked.
Hill: Emily Flippen, Jason Moser, thanks for being here.
Moser: Thank you.
Flippen: Thanks, Chris.
Hill: That's going to do it for this week's Motley Fool Money. The show is mixed by Dan Boyd. Our producer is Mac Greer. I'm Chris Hill, thanks for listening. We'll see you next week.

2021-05-18 00:00:00+00:00,4 Consumer Cyclical Stocks To Watch In The Stock Market Now,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/4-consumer-cyclical-stocks-to-watch-in-the-stock-market-now-2021-05-18,,,"Are These The Best Consumer Cyclical Stocks To Buy In The Stock Market Today?
Consumer cyclical stocks have been on the rise lately in the stock market. This should not come as a surprise as this category of stocks relies heavily on the business cycle and economic conditions. It includes industries such as automotive, housing, entertainment, and retail. As the name suggests, consumer spending would dictate the performance of the company. And consumer spending is affected by economic factors such as interest rates, inflation, unemployment, and wage growth. So with the economy recovering, this puts consumer cyclical stocks back on the radar of investors.
You can see this in the stock performance of companies such as Home Depot Inc (NYSE: HD) and McDonald’s Corp (NYSE: MCD). Since March, both stocks have been on an upward trend. On one hand, HD stock has been up by over 20% within this short period. On the other hand, MCD stock has risen by over 10% as well. Hence, cyclical stocks are viewed as more volatile than non-cyclical stocks, which tend to be more stable during periods of economic weakness. However, they offer greater potential for growth because they can outperform the market during periods of economic strength. So, if this fits your investment appetite, here are four of the best consumer cyclical stocks in the stock market today. 
Top Consumer Cyclical Stocks To Watch Now
Dillard’s, Inc (NYSE: DDS)
eBay Inc (NASDAQ: EBAY)
The Children’s Place Inc (NASDAQ: PLCE)
Harley-Davidson Inc (NYSE: HOG)
Dillard’s, Inc
To kick off the list, we have the retail giant Dillard’s. The company is a retailer of fashion apparel, cosmetics, and home furnishing. As of January 30, 2021, the company operated 282 Dillard’s stores, including 32 clearance centers, and an Internet store. The company focuses on delivering style, quality, and value to its customers from both national and exclusive brand sources.
Source: TD Ameritrade TOS
When looking at the DDS stock, it is hard to argue against its excellent performance over the past year. The stock has risen over a staggering 550% during this period. In fact, the stock price rose by almost 50% just in the past week. Now let us dive deeper as to why this is happening. 
Last Friday, Dillard’s announced its first-quarter earnings. In comparison to the same quarter of the prior year, total retail sales increased by 73%. It also boasted a net income of $158.2 million compared to a net loss of $162.0 million. Finally, the company ended with cash of $616 million compared to $70 million. As vaccinations increased, stimulus money was released and warmer weather arrived. Dillard’s may see improved sales over the 2019 levels, with momentum continuing throughout the quarter. Given how impressive its financials are, would DDS stock be worth investing in?

eBay Inc 
Next, we have the global commerce company, eBay. The company’s technology allows sellers worldwide to offer their inventory for sale virtually anytime and anywhere. eBay’s platforms are accessible through a traditional online experience, mobile devices, and its application programming interfaces (APIs). Hence, consumers could easily access its platform as long as they have access to the internet.
Source: TD Ameritrade TOS
Earlier this month, the company announced that it will be letting sellers in Canada receive payouts in U.S. dollars. Canadian sellers by invitation will be able to register for this program and choose the payout option that best suits the needs of their business. This is significant as many Canadian eBay sellers do a majority of their business on eBay.com. The change impacts sellers enrolled in Managed Payments.
On top of that, eBay also announced the possibility of accepting cryptocurrency as a form of payment in the future. Clearly, the company is aware of newer forms of payments and taking steps to keep up with the trend. Also, eBay will be allowing consumers to purchase non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on its broad online marketplace. This reflects an expansion of eBay’s digital collectibles business, in line with the increasing popularity of NFTs this year. With that in mind, would EBAY stock be a sound investment?

4 Semiconductor Stocks To Watch Right Now
Best Stocks To Invest In Right Now? 4 E-Commerce Stocks To Watch
The Children’s Place Inc
The Children’s Place is a pure-play children’s specialty apparel retailer. The company provides apparel, footwear, accessories, and other items for children. It designs, contracts to manufacture, and licenses to sell merchandise under brand names, such as The Children’s Place, Place, Baby Place, and Gymboree. PLCE stock has been on a bullish run since the start of the year. It has risen over 75% during this period and shows very little weakness. The stock got a further boost on Monday, soaring by 15.96%.
Source: TD Ameritrade TOS
The recent hike is likely due to two Wall Street firms upgrading the children’s apparel retailer ahead of its earnings report later this week. Monness Crespi Hardt analyst Jim Chartier upgraded the retailer from neutral to buy and set a $93-per-share price target on the stock.
“Given much better than expected consumer spending and conservative guidance, we are raising our 1Q EPS estimate more than $1 above consensus and see the potential for more upside,” Chartier said. Meanwhile, Wedbush analyst Jen Redding also upgraded Children’s Place to an outperform rating from neutral for similarly bullish reasons. However, she sees the potential for the apparel retailer to nearly double in value. She set a price target of $150 per share. So, do you share the same sentiment as these analysts toward PLCE stock?

Harley-Davidson Inc
Last to make the list, the infamous Harley-Davidson. It operates in two segments: the Motorcycles & Related Products (Motorcycles) and the Financial Services. As you would’ve guessed, the Motorcycles segment designs, manufactures and sells at wholesale on-road Harley-Davidson motorcycles.
Source: TD Ameritrade TOS
On the other hand, the financial services segment provides wholesale and retail financing and insurance-related programs to Harley-Davidson dealers and their retail customers. HOG stock has more than doubled in value over the past year. In fact, it has reached a three-year high recently. Now I’m sure you would be curious as to what the driving force is.
This comes in light of the European Union’s decision to suspend a planned increase in retaliatory tariffs on its motorcycles as part of a partial trade truce with the U.S. This serves as an encouragement for the company as the tariff will not escalate from 31% to 56%. Hence, it is the first step in the right direction in favor of the company. Last week, Harley-Davidson also announced the launch of LiveWire as a standalone all-electric brand. The new brand will get its own engineering team dedicated to electric powertrains, but will also lean on Harley’s existing resources for engineering and manufacturing.

Shareholders of cloud storage company Box (NYSE:BOX) should be getting used to surprises by now. Yesterday, activist hedge fund Starboard Value LP issued an open letter to management, citing concerns over the company’s $500 million convertible preferred equity financing. This move follows Starboard’s proxy battle earlier this month to take greater control of the company. Activist battles like this one are nothing new. But, if Starboard succeeds and gains majority control of BOX’s board, the hedge fund has the potential to dramatically change the trajectory of the company — and BOX stock.

Oh, and that includes the ability to force its immediate sale.
While no one knows how the drama will play out, one thing is certain. Starboard has a track record of big returns in tech. With BOX shares still trading at a reasonable valuation, a slight premium to its closest competitor Dropbox (NASDAQ:DBX), now’s the time to place a bet on the stock.
Activist Investing 101: The Art of Influence and Winning Friends
Activist investors have a very simple operating strategy: Find an underperforming company, accumulate shares and then extract value by brute force. Activists have changed the composition of countless company boards through proxy contests. They’re also responsible for spin-offs and divestitures of underperforming assets. And they’re responsible for big stock returns.
Activist investing took a brief pause at the start of the coronavirus pandemic, with firms spending most of last year shoring up capital. Now, with the economy improving, activity has picked up. Already, Starboard is pursuing proxy battles against five U.S. companies, including Commvault Systems (NASDAQ:CVLT), Ebay (NASDAQ:EBAY), GCP Applied Technologies (NYSE:GCP), Mednax (NYSE:MED) and Merit Medical Systems (NASDAQ:MMSI).

7 Cheap Stocks to Buy Now Under $3
Starboard has a history of making big sweeping changes — starting by gaining influence on company boards. The New York-based hedge fund is looking for roughly two dozen board seats in total, according to the company’s latest filings. Starboard rose to fame around 2014 for its turnaround of restaurant chain Olive Garden, owned by Darden Restaurants (NYSE:DRI). The firm started by making tweaks to the company’s generous policy of giving customers unlimited breadsticks, along with other menu changes.
Ultimately, Starboard’s influence resulted in a shareholder vote to remove all 12 Darden directors and install Starboard’s slate, a rare feat for a hedge fund at a major U.S. company.
The Battle at BOX
Now, Starboard wants to shake things up at BOX. The firm, which owns just under 8% of BOX outstanding shares, initially built a friendly stake in September 2019. The two appeared to have reached a standstill agreement last year that allowed Starboard to add three board members and form an operating committee.
But the relationship has since soured. Earlier this month, Starboard issued an open letter to Box management, rebuking the company for underperformance. Starboard’s letter cited increasing frustration with “continued poor results, questionable capital allocation decisions, and subpar shareholder returns.” As a result, the company nominated four members to Box’s board.
As you’d expect, BOX management didn’t appreciate the criticism. The company stated in a press release that it rejects this attempt by Starboard to take over additional seats. Box highlighted that it has already overhauled its board, having replaced three-long-standing directors with three new independent directors to its board under an agreement with Starboard in March 2020.
BOX Stock: Slowing Growth
So what’s Starboard so upset about? For starters, growth at BOX is slowing. In fact, the company’s growth rate has been in steady decline for years. For reference, in its most recently reported quarter, BOX grew just 8% on a year-over-year basis, down from 14% in F2020. The company has struggled to compete with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), which has aggressively expanded into the cloud-based collaboration space with its Teams product.
BOX’s business challenges have been an albatross for the stock, which has woefully lagged the market and other work-from-home tech peers. Zoom (NASDAQ:ZM) stock, for example, gained over 400% in 2020. Box gained just 8%, underperforming even the S&P 500, which rose 16%.
But there’s another reason Starboard is upset. BOX had reportedly been exploring a sale of the company to potential buyers, including private equity firms. But last month, the company backtracked, announcing a $500 million investment from KKR & Co. (NYSE:KKR).
The transaction is scheduled to close following BOX’s Q1 earnings results on May 27. BOX says it will use the proceeds to buy back stock and bring value to shareholders. This would presumably involve buying out Starboard.
What’s Next for BOX?
For BOX, KKR’s investment is a lifeline in its battle with Starboard and sends a clear signal that management has no interest in selling the company.
But Starboard won’t take no for an answer. The firm, which is clearly pushing for an outright sale of the company, says the offering “has no bona fide business purpose” and was done solely to entrench the Board and “buy the vote” ahead of elections.
So, what’s the next catalyst for BOX stock? The Board vote, which will take place at the company’s shareholder meeting, likely in late June or early July.
The vote is clearly a binary event. But either outcome looks good for BOX stock. First, if Starboard has its way and wins a majority of board seats, it’s likely to remove BOX CEO Aaron Levie and/or actively explore a sale of the company.
But even if Starboard fails to win more board seats, things could still get better at BOX. With KKR’s investment, BOX will likely take additional steps to bulk up its product offering. In particular, the company could expand on its February acquisition of e-signature provider SignRequest.
With the board vote an important binary event, now’s the time to buy BOX stock. BOX shares trade at 17x EBITDA, a slight premium to its closest competitor Dropbox, at 14x. The shares have been on a steady uptrend. BOX is now up 33% year-to-date, versus a 14.6% decline for Zoom and an 18% gain for Dropbox. Even with the recent run in the stock, the risk-to-reward looks reasonable here.

2021-05-18 00:00:00+00:00,2 International Tech Stocks to Buy Right Now,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/2-international-tech-stocks-to-buy-right-now-2021-05-18,,,"Many American tech stocks surged last year, as remote work and stay-at-home trends boosted demand for cloud services, software, and components for consumer electronics. The tech sector was also better insulated from the pandemic than many other sectors.
But over the past few months, that trend reversed as rising bond yields sparked a rotation from growth to value stocks. Investors also pivoted from pandemic stocks toward reopening plays, and many high-flying tech stock prices have plunged.
It's tempting to fish for bargains right now in the U.S. tech sector, but investors shouldn't overlook the international tech stocks that were also rattled by the same market rotation. Here are two growing overseas companies that deserve a closer look.
Image source: Getty Images.
1. ASML
ASML (NASDAQ: ASML) is one of the world's most important semiconductor equipment makers. The Dutch company is the world's top supplier of photolithography systems, which etch circuit patterns into silicon wafers.
The world's most advanced chip foundries, including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM), Samsung, and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), all use ASML's systems. ASML's top customer is TSMC, which can't produce its smallest 5nm and 7nm chips without using ASML's top-tier EUV (extreme ultraviolet) systems.
Therefore, ASML is just as crucial to resolving the global semiconductor shortage as TSMC. ASML doesn't face any meaningful competition in the EUV market, since it developed its technology over the past two decades, and it will launch even more powerful high-NA EUV systems within the next few years.
ASML's revenue and net income rose 18% and 37%, respectively, in 2020. It shipped its 100th EUV system in the fourth quarter and generated 43% of its revenue from those higher-margin systems for the full year. That growth continued throughout the first quarter of 2021.
For the full year, analysts expect ASML's revenue to rise 49% and 72%, respectively, as the world's top foundries all ramp up their spending to resolve the semiconductor crisis. A lot of that capex will likely be spent on ASML's systems.
ASML's stock has more than doubled over the past 12 months, but it still looks reasonably valued at 35 times forward earnings and remains a solid all-around play on the semiconductor sector.
2. Adyen
Adyen (OTC: ADYE.Y) is a Dutch fintech company that gained a lot of attention after it replaced PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL) as eBay's (NASDAQ: EBAY) payment processor. Adyen generated most of its revenue in Europe last year, but it has a growing presence in North America, Latin America, and Asia. In addition to processing online payments, Adyen helps merchants issue their own virtual payment cards and sells third-party POS (point of sale) systems.
Image source: Getty Images.
Unlike PayPal and Square (NYSE: SQ), Adyen doesn't offer any cryptocurrency transactions. It also doesn't provide native peer-to-peer payments like PayPal's Venmo or Square's Cash App. Instead, it provides tools that allow businesses to facilitate both peer-to-peer and business-to-consumer within their own apps.
In other words, Adyen is a simpler play on the growing fintech market than PayPal and Square, which have both expanded their ecosystems far beyond basic digital payments.
Adyen's revenue rose 28% to 684.2 million euros ($825.4 million) in fiscal 2020, as the shift to online sales during the pandemic offset its loss of payments at physical stores. Its earnings grew 11%, and its adjusted EBITDA increased 27% to 402.5 million euros ($485.6 million).
Analysts expect Adyen's revenue and earnings to grow another 41% and 62%, respectively, this year. That acceleration can be attributed to the reopenings of brick-and-mortar businesses, its expansion into new markets, and the final stages of eBay's three-year transition away from PayPal.
Adyen's stock isn't cheap at about 120 times forward earnings, but its long-term growth potential in a cashless world might justify that premium valuation.
The bottom line
American investors might not be familiar with European tech stocks, but companies like ASML and Adyen stand out as great overseas investments. ASML is a crucial cog in the global semiconductor market, and Adyen could still attract plenty of businesses that rely on traditional POS systems.

WASHINGTON, May 17 (Reuters) - U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai discussed a range of trade issues with Canadian Trade Minister Mary Ng on Monday and emphasized the need for Canada to implement new North American trade deal commitments on dairy and e-commerce shipments, her office said in a statement.
In a virtual meeting on the eve of the first meeting of the U.S.-Mexico Canada Agreement Free Trade Commission, Tai also raised concerns about Canada's recently proposed digital services tax, USTR said. The trade agency is readying potential tariffs on six countries while international negotiations on the issue proceed.
A statement from Canada's trade ministry said Ng also raised concerns about U.S. trade policies but the two agreed on the need to strengthen North American supply chains, collaborate on COVID-19 recovery and implement the USMCA's labor rights provisions.
These included concerns about U.S. ""Buy America"" government procurement restrictions and an ongoing dispute over U.S. tariffs on Canadian softwood lumber. American home builders and U.S. lawmakers have asked Tai to lift the 9% duties to ease a supply crunch that has sent lumber prices soaring.
""Minister Ng reiterated that it was in the best interest of both countries to reach an agreement on softwood lumber and raised the impacts of solar safeguards,"" the trade ministry said.
Ng also brought up a dispute over Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer's order that Canadian pipeline company Enbridge ENB.TO shut down a crude pipeline over safety concerns, a move Canada says would violate a 1977 treaty.
The trade ministry said Ng ""noted the importance of the continued safe operation of Line 5"" which runs under the Straits of Mackinac in the Great Lakes.
The USMCA trade deal allowed for improved access for U.S. dairy farmers to Canada's highly protected dairy market. The Trump administration in December said it was challenging Canada's allocation of tariff-rate quotas for dairy.
The trade deal also raised the ""de-minimis"" duty-free threshold for small duty-free shipments of goods to C$150 from C$20 previously, a move expected to benefit U.S. e-commerce companies such as Amazon.com AMZN.O and eBay EBAY.O
The meeting of the USMCA Free Trade Council, which includes Tai, Ng and Mexican Economy Minister Tatiana Clouthier, will also discuss several irritants in Mexico's implementation of the accord, notably on labor rights. Tai has pledged to bring up allegations that labor rights were denied in a union contract vote at a General Motors GM.N truck plant in the central Mexican city of Silao and a union membership drive at an auto parts plant in the Texas border city of Matamoros.

2021-05-16 00:00:00+00:00,Will Etsy's Stock Extend Its Rise In 2021?,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/will-etsys-stock-extend-its-rise-in-2021-2021-05-16,,,"Etsy’s stock (NASDAQ: ETSY), an American e-commerce website focused on handmade or vintage items and craft supplies, has gained 3.6x – moving from about $44 to $159 since the end of 2019 and as per consensus analyst estimates the stock price could potentially go up by 40% over the current price of $159. The company hugely benefited from the shift toward online commerce due to the Covid-19 pandemic last year. The company saw significant improvement in the value of buyer cohorts, as they acquired 61 million new and reactivated buyers, and saw nearly 160% growth in their habitual buyers. This led to the company more than doubling their FY 2020 revenue to $1.73 billion compared to 0.82 billion in 2019. Their Gross Merchandise Sales (GMS) also increased by 107% to $10.28 billion in 2020 from $4.97 billion in 2019. Along with high revenue and Merchandise sales Etsy also improved its Net Income margin to 20% in 2020 from 11% in 2019. Our dashboard, ‘Buy or Sell Etsy Stock?‘ provides the key numbers behind our thinking, and we explain more below.
Etsy revenues saw a massive growth of 291% from $0.4 billion in 2017 to $1.7 billion in 2020. In the same period, the Net Income margin has risen by 9.2%. This, in turn, saw EPS grow by 317% from $0.69 in 2017 to $2.88 in 2020. Etsy’s P/E was around 30x at the end of 2017 and has fluctuated in 2018-19. It was recorded at 63x at the end of 2020 but has decreased slightly to 55x currently.
How Is Coronavirus Impacting Etsy’s Stock?
The online commerce sector saw a boom in 2020 as the onset of the pandemic led people to shift their buying preferences to online websites as opposed to visiting brick and mortar stores. This momentum continued for Etsy in 2021 as witnessed by its Q1 2021 results. For the first quarter GMS rose by 132% to $3.1 billion compared to $1.3 billion in the same period of the previous year. Net revenue increased by 141% to $550 million while Net Income increased 11.5x to $143 million primarily due to better operating margins and a tax benefit of $14 million. Etsy’s stock witnessed a sell off after its Q1 2021 results, as their Q2 2021 guidance shows a deceleration in its GMS along with the rest of the e-commerce compared to the tremendous growth rates of Q2 2020, which was the height of the pandemic in the US. We believe this sell-off in the past few days has made the stock attractive with the consensus analyst estimates expecting the stock to grow up to 40% from the current level of $159 as the company continues improving its operating margin and consumers shift toward online commerce continues.
