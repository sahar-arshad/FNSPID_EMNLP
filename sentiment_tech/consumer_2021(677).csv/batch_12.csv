*Stock Advisor returns as of October 20, 2021
Matt Frankel: Toby, what do you think PayPal is thinking here as a PayPal shareholder?
Toby Bordelon: That's actually an interesting question because when I first saw there was this deal, my reaction was, I'm not sure what the intent is here, I really don't see this making sense. If you look at Pinterest, you look at their platform, you look at the attraction. There's always been the story told, which I think is an accurate one, about how Pinterest users goes to the platform with the intent or if not the intent, at least the willingness and desire to spend money. They're looking for stuff, looking for something might want to put in their projects, looking for ideas. They have this thing, they want to do something and this is going to help them do it. They're prime to spend money.
Therefore, they're better targets for advertising. They're more desirable and they can command higher rates, that's been the theory. That's played out, we've seen that a little bit. The theory with PayPal is that if someone is going to spend money, PayPal's ID as well, they might as well be using our system to spend it. You can see the synergies there, but it's also a separate move. It's not like when you had PayPal and eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY), eBay was a store. You go buy now, you want to use PayPal, done. Pinterest isn't quite that same thing, there's some more mechanics that have to go into that to attempt to direct the Pinterest users to the PayPal system. It's a little more complicated, I think.
My thoughts went to PayPal's acquisition of Paidy, like the Japanese buy now, pay later company, which they're in the process of doing. You can see how that might work. Pinterest want to do this project, do you want to spend your money now? You can use the Payday. They're expanding their system, they're expanding the universe of ways to spend money. With Pinterest, maybe they're expanding their hooks into potential consumers to bring them over there. That's the thing that makes sense to me.
I almost think it makes more sense from a Pinterest standpoint, from a business standpoint. In other words, Pinterest, do they want to be more than advertising? Are they seeing the saturation in monthly active users, to want to be more than that, who want to expand beyond that revenue-based, maybe a combination with PayPal provides some opportunities to do that. But at least for me, it wasn't something at first glance where I said, ""Oh, this is awesome."" My first reaction was very much, ""I don't know. That share with the four rationales for this.""
That's odd because usually I can see it, I can see it pretty clearly when companies do this. I don't know. I guess I can see what management's thinking for PayPal, but I don't know. For me, this is not a home run, like this is not an obvious deal. That's why I think you're seeing the stock down too. I think many PayPal shareholders scratching their heads saying, ""What does this do?""
Frankel: Jason, if you we're not a disgruntled Pinterest shareholder today, why do you think they're making this deal?
Jason Hall: Thinking about it from the Pinterest perspective, I really do. We talked about this last night on The Five, we spent a a pretty good bit of time going through it, and I've been thinking about it more this morning. Again, I think with Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), just not that long ago, was apparently making a push here. At some point, this isn't about companies trying to buy you, maybe it becomes about you trying to be bought. Because at some point, the negotiations continue, and they get leaked, and they come out. It takes two parties to tango.
I wonder if from some people inside Pinterest, they really are starting to think that it's better for the business to be part of something else. From PayPal, Rachel last night was talking about it, and she brought up something of interest talking about social comers. If you think about from PayPal's perspective, having grown so far beyond eBay. They're not even eBay's payment processor anymore. It's so tied to those social transactions at this point, which really fits with something like Pinterest, it really, really does.
I think from PayPal perspective, because you have a Pinterest that generates positive cash flow. This is a business that generated like $300 million in free cash flow over the past year, so maybe there's GAAP losses from time to time, but you're bolting with something on that generates enough free cash flow to cover its business, and that's great, and it can be invested into its business. Then you start thinking about ways to accelerate what we know Pinterest is already trying to do, which is to build more integration for people to use it for the commerce part, not just the advertising part. You want to get those ad revenues, but you have a big company that's using Pinterest for their catalogs, for example.
You don't want them just to pay you to host that or to give you a click through. When you click to go to their social or to go to their e-commerce platform, You wanted to be able to click ""Buy"" right there in Pinterest if they see something they want to buy. As eBay, you want to be able to participate in the processing of that. There's so many things that seem to make sense so long as they have a light touch. If they PayPal it too much, it loses the attraction, it loses what makes Pinterest so interesting. I think that's the risks there, but I think there's a lot of things about it that makes sense. If they do it the right way.
Frankel: One thing I would point out, I just want to piggyback like two quick points off that. One, Pinterest actually has more active users than PayPal, 454 million worldwide versus 403 million, so it could be a way for PayPal to bring even more users into its ecosystem if it feels like growth potential in its core business is limited. That could be a way to really kick start some growth. Number two, Pinterest is already partnering with some other e-commerce platforms, like Shopify (NYSE: SHOP) in particular.

(NASDAQ:EBAY), Kathleen Mitic, Has Sold Some Shares Recently",EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/trade-alert%3A-the-independent-director-of-ebay-inc.-nasdaq%3Aebay-kathleen-mitic-has-sold,,,"Some eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY) shareholders may be a little concerned to see that the Independent Director, Kathleen Mitic, recently sold a substantial US$1.2m worth of stock at a price of US$75.79 per share. That's a big disposal, and it decreased their holding size by 44%, which is notable but not too bad.
eBay Insider Transactions Over The Last Year
In the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Independent Director, Robert Swan, sold US$3.7m worth of shares at a price of US$61.55 per share. So it's clear an insider wanted to take some cash off the table, even below the current price of US$73.76. When an insider sells below the current price, it suggests that they considered that lower price to be fair. That makes us wonder what they think of the (higher) recent valuation. While insider selling is not a positive sign, we can't be sure if it does mean insiders think the shares are fully valued, so it's only a weak sign. It is worth noting that this sale was only 19% of Robert Swan's holding.
In total, eBay insiders sold more than they bought over the last year. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!

Does eBay Boast High Insider Ownership?
Many investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. eBay insiders own about US$1.8b worth of shares (which is 4.0% of the company). Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.
So What Do The eBay Insider Transactions Indicate?
The stark truth for eBay is that there has been more insider selling than insider buying in the last three months. Despite some insider buying, the longer term picture doesn't make us feel much more positive. The company boasts high insider ownership, but we're a little hesitant, given the history of share sales. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision. In terms of investment risks, we've identified 3 warning signs with eBay and understanding these should be part of your investment process.

2021-11-08 00:00:00+00:00,"Donât Expect Amazon Stock to Have a Great Q4, Either",EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/dont-expect-amazon-stock-to-have-a-great-q4-either,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
I like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock.
I donât think a week goes by when thereâs not an Amazon delivery coming to my house, and I know my neighbors seem to be just as eager to shop on Amazon than I do. The delivery drivers know our street like the back of their hands at this point.
Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com
But AMZN stock has some problems at this point, and I donât think theyâre going to be cleared up any time soon. Third-quarter earnings werenât great. And there are plenty of red flags surrounding the critical Q4 shopping period already.
Iâm not saying that you should sell AMZN stock. But if youâre looking for a quick profit, Amazon wonât likely outperform the market for the next couple of quarters.
On the other hand, a 5% dip in Amazon in the coming weeks would be a really tempting signal to snatch up some discounted shares.
Hereâs a closer look at the third quarter results and why I think Q4 may be problematic for this dominate e-commerce and cloud company.
AMZN Stock at Glance
First, the stock itself. Amazon trades at nearly $3,500 per share, but its chart looks more like a hospital EKG than a blue-chip stock. The peaks and valleys in 2021 are stomach-churning.
10 S&P 500 Stocks to Buy After Winning in Q3
For 2021, AMZN stock is up 14%, which is solid until you look at the Nasdaq composite, which is up 22% in the same period.
Competitors eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY, up 31%), and Shopify (NYSE:SHOP, up 45%) are also doing much better than Amazon.
Part of the problem for Amazon is that itâs being compared to 2020 numbers. And with the Covid-19 pandemic, there was nothing normal about 2020.
Amazon and other online retailers had huge years last year as brick-and-mortar businesses shut down during the pandemic. Shopping online for groceries, cleaning supplies, toilet paper and basic household necessities consumed us all.
Now stores have reopened, kids are back in school, and many offices have returned to face-to-face environments. People are more willing today to shop in physical stores and Amazon is dealing with the fallout from that.
In late October, Amazon reported third-quarter earnings that disappointed investors.
Revenue came in at $110.81 billion, versus analystsâ expectations of $111.6 billion. Earnings per share was also a miss, as Amazon posted $6.12 per share versus analystsâ expectations of $8.92 per share.
In an interesting side note, the third quarter was the first time in Amazonâs history that its fast-growing Amazon services division posted greater revenue that its retail division. The retail side made $54.9 billion. But revenue from Amazon Prime subscriptions, advertising and its cloud component Amazon Web Services made $55.9 billion.
CNBC reported that if it hadnât been for Amazon Web Servicesâ $4.88 billion in revenue for the quarter, the company would have lost money. AWS revenue rose 39% in the quarter.
Problems Ahead
The fourth quarter doesnât look good for Amazon, and the biggest issue is the problem with the supply chain. I donât know about you, but more often than not my two-day Amazon Prime deliveries are coming in three or four days.
Itâs not Amazonâs fault. If they canât get the products, they canât ship them to me. But itâs also made me more willing to shop other outlets or actually visit stores to buy something.
Either way, the problem is going to get worse for Amazon before it gets better. Amazon CFO Brian Olsavsky says the company will take a $4 billion charge in the fourth quarter from increased labor costs, productivity losses and inflation.
Operating profit in the fourth quarter will also take a big hit. Amazon is expecting a range of zero to $3 billion. A year ago, Amazon posted a profit of $6.9 billion in Q4.
Citi analyst Jason Bazinet kept his buy rating on AMZN shares, but he lowered his price target from $4,175 to $4,100.
The Bottom Line
With the busy holiday shopping season, you can usually expect strong fourth quarters from Amazon stock. And as long as Amazon hits analysts expectations in those quarterly report, and AWS continues to grow, Amazon stock is a reliable winner.
Iâve got a of confidence that AWS will be strong again during the fourth quarter. But Amazonâs heavy spending in pushing goods to customers, as well as the continued supply chain issues in the fourth quarter, are troubling.
And remember, Amazon (as well as other companies) are always evaluated on a year-over-year basis. For Amazon, that means being compared to pandemic-inflated numbers in Q4.
Amazon stock may manage to produce a modest gain over the next few weeks. That would be a pleasant surprise. But donât buy AMZN stock now expecting a booming Q4 report.
Itâs more likely that Amazon will continue its up-and-down ride, at least until the supply chain issues improve and the pandemic effects fade away.

10 stocks we like better than eBay

See the 10 stocks
*Stock Advisor returns as of October 20, 2021
This video was recorded on Oct. 28, 2021.
Chris Hill: It's Thursday, Oct. 28. Welcome to MarketFoolery. I'm Chris Hill. With me today, Maria Gallagher. Good to see you.
Maria Gallagher: Nice to see you, too.
Hill: We've got a beverage company posting big numbers, and we have a hot automotive stock that is not named Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA). But we're going to start with eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY). Third-quarter profits and revenue came in higher than expected for eBay, but you would not know that from what is happening with the stock because shares of eBay are down 7% this morning. Is this guidance? What's going on here?
Gallagher: They did have revenue up about 11%. Their active buyers were down now two quarters in a row, there's still 154 million. Their second quarter of GMV declined as well. Two quarters in a row of both active buyers and GMV declining and their annual active sellers is flat. Plus they had tepid guidance going into the holiday season, which is always something you want to have higher guidance for. Something that I thought was pretty interesting as I was looking through though, is that I think there's some kind of fascinating implications with authentication. They're continuing to expand that authenticity guarantee program. They are launching that with sneakers. They added 30 brands to their catalog, within sneakers. They're also doing price guidance and collection for trading cards. There have been 4 million cards purchased on or off eBay that have been added to these collections. I think that's a fascinating thing where you see companies that can maintain a specific niche can survive for quite some time. I think eBay leans into this niche of saying, really good trading cards, their sneakers are things that are rare. You have to look for them and you have to have some authentication process. I think that could be pretty interesting for them, but I'm not too surprised that the stock's down a little bit.
Hill: Obviously, we're going into an important quarter for a lot of businesses. eBay's certainly one of them. It's interesting to me that eBay currently gets, not forgotten but dismissed. There are just a lot of people in the investing community here just saying what are they really, they blew it, they had PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL), they let it go. Stock's up 35% over the past year. It's a market beater over the past five years. I don't know. I've got a soft spot in my heart for eBay because it's constantly dismissed. Yet, if you're a shareholder, and you've been holding for a while, you've been rewarded by this business.
Gallagher: Yeah. I do think it's important to note, they have 154 million active buyers, even with that decline. If you compare that to, Etsy I think it's a comparison a lot of people draw. Etsy (NASDAQ: ETSY) has about 90 million, so it's still really massive. A lot of people still go to eBay. It's still top-of-mind for many consumers, and so I think that they have a stronger platform than I think people give them credit for.
Hill: Last thing before we move on, did they offer any guidance in terms of what they expect to be spending in terms of marketing over the next few months. My memory of 2020, when it comes to this business is eBay was spending a lot of money marketing, trying to get as many of those holiday shoppers as they could.
Gallagher: I didn't see that noted, but I wouldn't be surprised if they continue to ramp up that spend on marketing. They have been ramping up additionally, buybacks and dividends. They are trying to allocate their capital well for shareholders.
Hill: Shares of Ford Motor up nearly 10% this morning after third-quarter results were much better than expected. Ford also raised fiscal year guidance, citing strong demand. Yes, the chip shortage is still going on, but Ford says things are getting better this quarter, and they expect that improvement to improve to continue into 2022.
Gallagher: Yeah. Quarterly revenue was about 35.7 billion. They increased guidance, like you said, for the full year. They are resuming the regular dividend in quarter four, which is really exciting for them. They were talking about, they have high demand for new products with their EVs, their earnings power in North America. What I think is really interesting is, you see a pretty strong concentration with sales in the U.S. They have market share in North America at about 11.2%. It goes down to about 6% in Europe and 2% for the rest of the world. In 2020, the best-selling car in the whole world was the Toyota Corolla, Ford was No. 6 with Ford F-150. The Ford F-150 is the best-selling vehicle in America. I do think it's really interesting to see, specifically U.S. consumers and the demand for new cars and the continuation of the loyalty to that Ford brand will be important, especially as you've had that demand over the past year and the supply with the supply constraints have been able to quite meet that. But seeing that in the next couple of months, we'll see how they do.
Hill: This is yet another situation where I just want to fast forward to six months. With the release that's coming in early 2022 of the EV version of the Ford F-150. It's going to be really interesting to see what the demand for that is, what the deliveries look like. If they can keep up with that. Certainly, when they announced it, I think they had somewhere in the neighborhood of 50,000 reservations. I don't know if there were actual orders because it didn't involve money being put down. But I think it was in the first 48 hours, somewhere in the neighborhood of 50,000 people are like, yes, I'm very interested in possibly buying this vehicle.
Gallagher: Yeah, I think that that's what we're going to see is we have this demand in general, they are thinking about auto sales in 2021 is going to be an increase of 7% over 2020 and they're not quite reaching 2019 levels. But I think we're seeing really strong demand tick back up. I mean, we're getting closer to the happy Hondadays, which I think it just really marks when we have the holidays, everyone really is ready to go with buying cars.
Hill: Wait, what?
Gallagher: Happy Hondadays.
Hill: Are they paying you to promote this on the show?
Gallagher: I don't know but I think about it every year.
Hill: It touches one of those things that's burned into your memory from childhood?
Gallagher: Yeah. I just feel like every time I turned on the TV it was always happy Hondaday. I just think it's a good play on words. I think of it every year, I don't own a Honda. I don't necessarily will buy a Honda, but I do think about it every year.
Hill: It's certainly a much better play on words than happy Geicoween. Geico, you do a lot of things right when it comes to marketing. Just please, the Geicoween it's not working. Just move on. Just like, do something else next October, please. Anheuser-Busch InBev sold more beer in the third quarter at higher prices, all of which led to surprisingly strong profits for Budweiser's parent company, and shares of AB InBev up 12%. This is impressive just on its own. It's even more impressive when you realize they're doing this at a time when they are dealing with higher input costs.
Gallagher: Yes. Their revenue was up 8%, their total volumes were up about 4% so people are spending more. Non-beer sales were up about 8%. Beyond beer, which is their segment that's mainly hard seltzers is adding profitable growth that had over a billion in revenue year to date. What's interesting here too is that there's a lot of strong growth in South America. Mexico, Colombia, Brazil have all had really strong growth. Brazil had top-line growth of over 15% and beer volumes there are reaching all-time high. South Africa also had really strong growth. I think that's pretty interesting and they're talking about expanding into the Dominican Republic and seeing where they get traction outside of the U.S. They're expanding more as well into that hard seltzer line. They're scaling the Mike's Hard portfolio, the [...] I don't actually know how to pronounce that, it's a word I've only read. Their hard seltzer is leading in Mexico with about 50% market share. It was a really solid quarter, and I will be interested to see how demand continues in the next year or two.
Hill: Yeah. This is one of those quarters that reminds you for as much as Budweiser is a quintessential American brand that this is a global business. Again, their ability to put up these kind of numbers when they're also dealing with shipping issues like pretty much every global businesses, they're dealing with higher input costs. There are times when having that global footprint can represent a risk in terms of weakness in certain international markets. This is one of those quarters where A-B InBev demonstrates the strength of their international footprint.
Gallagher: Yeah. That diversification strategy is really strong. It's also fascinating too that during the pandemic, people started shifting more to spending on spirits when people were home and so their distillers revenue was up 8% in 2020, which was their fastest growth in 40 years. I'll be curious to see how people are now shifting back to beer and how e-commerce grows with beer. That's another thing that they noted as well is that direct-to-consumer through apps and stuff. I think it will be interesting to look at consumer spending habits within this area.
Hill: Well, and along with consumer spending habits, where do states and localities go with regulations around alcohol sales? We've seen a lot of loosening of that, certainly with restaurants and getting alcohol to go and that sort of thing. You never want to buy a stock where there are so many variables that you find yourself using the word if many times. If this happens and all that sort of thing. But the state and local regulatory picture, there's a version of it where it very much moves in the favor of businesses like Anheuser-Busch InBev and obviously, they have competition from the likes of Boston Beer Company (NYSE: SAM) and others. But this is the biggest one. This is the behemoths in the industry and they've got more levers they can pull to take advantage of a more favorable regulatory environment.
Gallagher: Yeah. Absolutely. I think they have enough connections and diversification, like you said, all over the world so that it can help them and if it hurts them, they will be able, hopefully to kind of balance out that hurt with some other growth.
Hill: Last thing before we move on. I don't know if they gave any indication of this on the call. How acquisition inclined do you think this business is right now, we've certainly seen smaller players whether it's in the beer space, certainly the hard seltzer space, we've seen smaller players pop up. Some of them struggle, for a lot of them, their goal, their end business goal is to be acquired by a behemoth like this. Did they give you any indication of that? If not, where do you think they are going in the next couple of years?
Gallagher: Well, I think that because the U.S. was down a little bit compared to international growth, I think that that would be a natural place to look for an acquisition. Especially, they have some of their hard seltzer brands so it could be something interesting kind of beyond their typical beer brands so I wouldn't be surprised if they did something like that.
Hill: Two housekeeping notes. First, earnings-palooza is happening on Motley Fool Money this week. After the bell today we've got the latest results from Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), and Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX), among others. We're going to hit all of those and more on a very earnings heavy Motley Fool Money so check that out this weekend. Also this weekend, sometime on Saturday, this is both a promise and a warning, a bonus episode of MarketFoolery is going to show up in your feed. It is our Apropos of Nothing episode, me and a couple of friends talking about a lot of things other than investing. If you're looking forward to that, great. That's coming sometime on Saturday. If you're looking to avoid that, consider yourself warned. We get to wrap up. This is the last show before Halloween so you're the last analyst to weigh in on overrated and underrated Halloween candy. People have been reacting. People are very passionate about their candy. If social media is any indication, people are very passionate about how they feel about analysts on this show calling out their candy as being overrated or underrated. With that, what are you going for overrated candy?
Gallagher: Well, I'm coming in passionate. I love candy. I love chocolate. I have very strong opinions. Wait, the question was overrated, right?
Hill: Overrated
Gallagher: OK. I don't like Snickers.
Hill: Wow.
Gallagher: I know that that is a pretty hot take and I'm expecting some pushback but I looked at to determine what I could find over underrated. I looked at the map of what the most popular candy is in each state and I think like five states had Snickers. I just don't think they're that redeemable. I don't like them and I don't like stickiness.
Hill: It's the stickiness, it's not the nuts.
Gallagher: No. I love chocolate with nuts. I think it's the caramel and the bottom. I don't know what the texture is at the bottom, but I don't like it.
Hill: I believe it's called nougat.
Gallagher: Yeah. It's not good. [laughs] It's a no for me.
Hill: Hard no on Snickers. OK. Underrated?
Gallagher: I really like the bags of candy where you just get a bunch of small chocolate. But in that, I really love a Mr. Goodbar. Just classic nuts and chocolate and I just think every time I get a Mr. Goodbar, I'm excited.
Hill: It is candy close to my heart and my taste buds and therefore probably my arteries but yeah, I'm right there with you on Mr. Goodbar. Bill Mann and I were talking yesterday about either the night you get back from Halloween. If you have siblings and you're trading candy, or just the next day, you get together with your friends and just the whole prospect of like, I've got this candy, I'm interested in trading, and for a lot of kids, their first introduction to value. It's like look, if you like Mr. Goodbar, and there are kids who don't like it, that's an opportunity for you to trade away your Snickers. Because to your point, Snickers is a very popular candy.
Gallagher: Yeah. I think it teaches kids. We used to do it in terms of my grandma taught me poker when she was babysitting me, and that [laughs] was how we played was we use candy and chocolate instead of chips.
Hill: That is a great grandmother.
Gallagher: Yeah. She knew what she was doing.
Hill: Maria Gallagher, great talking to you. Thanks for being here.
Gallagher: Thanks for having me.

2021-11-05 00:00:00+00:00,E-Commerce Stocks Have Underperformed This Year. Should You Buy Ahead Of The Holidays?,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/e-commerce-stocks-have-underperformed-this-year.-should-you-buy-ahead-of-the-holidays-2021,,,"Our theme of E-Commerce Stocks â which is comprised of U.S.-based e-commerce companies as well as logistics, and payment players, has returned about 17% year-to-date, underperforming the S&P 500 which remains up by about 23% over the same period. However, the theme is up a solid 171% since the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic (end of February 2020).
So whatâs the near-term outlook like for the theme? Now the broader retail space is poised for a strong holiday season as consumers have more money to spend given the stimulus payments, strong trends in wages, and rising household wealth. E-commerce players should also benefit, given that the pandemic has altered consumer behavior to favor online shopping. That said, there are a few factors that could weigh on e-commerce players through the holidays. Firstly, itâs likely that growing vaccination rates and the recent decline in Covid-19 cases could drive up spending in brick-and-mortar stores, potentially taking some sheen off e-commerce growth. Moreover, companies have been contending with significant supply issues, due to logistics problems, the current semiconductor shortage, and the overall disruption caused by Covid-19 on supply chains. This could mean that discounting could be somewhat limited.
Within our theme, eBay (EBAY) stock has been the strongest performer, rising by about 49% year-to-date, driven by stronger demand growth and also due to its lower valuation multiples which have helped it capitalize on the broader rotation from high-growth to value stocks over the last few months. On the other side, FedEx (FDX) has been the weakest performer, with its stock down by about 9% year-to-date as rising costs have hurt its profitability.
While e-commerce players are gaining at the expense of brick and mortar retailers, check out our theme of Fintech Stocks for a list of companies that could potentially disrupt the $1.5 trillion-plus U.S. insurance and financial services industry.
[8/9/2021] E-Commerce Stocks Look Attractive Following Post Earnings Sell-Off
Our theme of E-Commerce Stocks â which is comprised of U.S.-based e-commerce companies as well as logistics, and payment players, has declined by about 7% over the last month, compared to the S&P 500 which rose 1.5% over the same period. While second-quarter earnings turned out stronger than expected for most e-commerce companies that have reported results, mixed Q3 guidance and expectations of slowing growth post the Covid-19 lockdowns appear to have hurt sentiment for the fast-growing sector. For instance, e-commerce bellwether Amazon saw revenue growth slow to 27% year-over-year in Q2 201, down from about 44% in Q1, while noting that growth could slow further in Q3 to about 13.5%, based on the mid-point of guidance.
That being said, we think the recent decline presents an opportunity to enter the sector. Covid-19 cases in the U.S. are on the rise once again, driven by the spread of the highly infectious Delta variant of the virus. The seven-day average infection rate in the U.S. has risen from 22,000 in early July to over 100,000 cases presently. This could delay the re-opening of workplaces and keep people at home for a few more quarters, helping e-commerce stocks in the near term. Moreover, while there was already a secular shift to online shopping prior to Covid-19, the pandemic is likely to accelerate this trend, given the changes in consumer behavior through months of lockdowns, helping these stocks in the longer run.
[7/8/2021] Why E-Commerce Stocks Are Still A Buy
Our theme of E-Commerce Stocks â which is comprised of U.S.-based e-commerce companies as well as logistics, and payment players â is up by 25% year-to-date, outperforming the broader Nasdaq-100 which is up by about 17% over the same period. The gains come despite the fact that the brick and mortar retail is opening up following Covid-19, with over half of U.S. adults now vaccinated and Covid cases on the decline. Now, e-commerce was gaining share from physical retail prior to Covid, and investors are likely betting that the pandemic is only likely to bolster the shift to online shopping, given the changes in consumer behavior through months of lockdowns. For example, research firm eMarketer estimates that U.S. retail e-commerce sales will grow by 13.7% this year and by 15% next year, with consumers expected to spend over $1 trillion via digital retail channels in 2022.
Within our theme, eBay (EBAY) stock has been the strongest performer, rising by about 39% year-to-date, driven by stronger demand growth and also due to its lower valuation multiples which have helped it capitalize on the broader rotation from high-growth to value stocks over the last few months. On the other side, Etsy (ETSY) a platform focused on handmade products, vintage items, and craft supplies, has been the worst performer within our theme, with its stock gaining just about 8%, amid weaker earnings guidance, as it faces a tough comparison with a solid pandemic year.
[4/6/2021] Will The Third Stimulus Check Help E-Commerce Stocks?
Our theme of E-Commerce Stocks â which includes U.S-based e-commerce platform players as well as logistics, and digital payment companies â is up by about 14% year-to-date, compared to the S&P 500 which is up by about 9% over the same period. The theme is also up by a solid 151% since the end of 2019, compared to a 26% return on the S&P 500. While investors have been rotating out of software and other high-growth stocks as the economy continues to open up following Covid-19, most e-commerce names in our theme have held up as investors likely expect e-commerce to continue eating into retail sales even post the pandemic. Moreover, itâs likely that a sizeable amount of the stimulus checks being mailed out as part of the $1.9 trillion Covid-19 rescue package will flow toward digital commerce spending, helping these companies. Within our theme, Wayfair (NYSE:W) a company that sells furniture and home goods online, has been the strongest performer with its stock up by about 43% year-to-date. On the other side, e-commerce bellwether Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has underperformed with its stock remaining roughly flat year-to-date.
[3/18/2021] E-Commerce Stocks To Watch
Our theme of E-Commerce Stocks includes U.S-based e-commerce platform players, logistics, and digital payment companies that stand to gain as shopping continues to move online. The e-commerce market has expanded significantly over the last year as the Covid-19 pandemic accelerated the shift away from brick and mortar stores to digital shopping, not just for discretionary items but also necessities. For perspective,  e-commerce as a percentage of overall U.S. retail sales jumped from around 16% in 2019 to almost 21% in 2020. [1] Thereâs a lot more room for the market to grow, considering that the total U.S. retail market stood at about $4 trillion in 2020. Our theme has outperformed the broader markets significantly, returning about 151% since the end of 2019, versus about 23% for the S&P 500. The theme is also up 11% year-to-date, compared to about 6% for the S&P 500. Below is a bit more about some of the companies in our theme and how they have fared.
Etsy (ETSY) an e-commerce platform that focuses on handmade products, vintage items, and craft supplies had a solid run through the pandemic, as gross merchandise sales, active buyers, and sellers on its platform soared. We think the company should continue to do well post the pandemic, as it could become the go-to platform for unique items that may not be available locally. The stock is up by about 388% since the end of 2019.
Wayfair (W), an e-commerce company that sells furniture and home goods, benefited from the trends of sheltering at home â which raised the demand for home improvement and the growing shift to e-commerce. The company is also building a very loyal base of customers, with more than two-thirds of its orders over its last quarter coming from repeat customers. The stock has gained a solid 248% since the end of 2019.
Carvana (CVNA) is an online used car retailer. Demand for used cars soared through Covid-19, as people look to avoid public transport. Moreover, customers shifted to e-commerce for buying cars as they remained averse to traditional in-person buys. The stock is up by about 208% since the end of 2019.
PayPal Holdings (PYPL) operates a worldwide online payments system that supports online money transfers. The stock has gained about 130% since the end of 2019, as people have preferred digital payment mediums through the Covid pandemic. Moreover, the companyâs move to allow users to buy, sell, and hold select Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin on its app has also helped its stock.
FedEx (FDX) stock is up by about 72% since the end of 2019. Although the company has seen some headwinds in recent years, as major customer Amazon doubled down on investments into its own logistics operations, the Covid-19 pandemic caused e-commerce shipments by the company to pick up. E-commerce should remain a tailwind, with the company expecting e-commerce package deliveries to more than triple to 111 million per day by 2026, up from about 35 million in 2019.
Amazon (AMZN), the e-commerce pioneer, saw demand for both its cloud computing business â Amazon Web Services â and its core online retail business soar through the pandemic, with revenue jumping by a solid 38% last year to about $386 billion. Amazon stock is up by about 67% since the end of 2019.

2021-11-04 00:00:00+00:00,3 Surprises in eBay's Third-Quarter Earnings Report,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-surprises-in-ebays-third-quarter-earnings-report-2021-11-04,,,"eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY) is going through a growth slowdown. Sales volumes are down, and the buyer base is declining from the record surge the marketplace saw in the second half of 2020, the company revealed last week in its third-quarter earnings report.
That slump is pressuring earnings, which are down over 50% in each of the last two quarters. But eBay still had plenty of good news to report in its Q3 announcement. Let's look at three surprisingly positive trends for the business heading into the key holiday shopping season.

1. Revenue rose 11% year over year
eBay managed to boost revenue at a double-digit percentage rate, even though sales volumes plunged 21% compared to the pandemic-boosted Q3 a year ago. The revenue spike also occurred despite a 5% drop in the pool of active buyers.
eBay offset those declines with strength in its growing payments and advertising segments. Success in these niches helped the company beat its sales targets for a second straight quarter. Back in August, management had predicted organic revenue gains of between 8% and 10%.
2. The 12% take rate
eBay's widening portfolio of services for sellers is helping it charge much more in transaction fees. That ""take rate"" rose to 12% of sales compared to 10% a year ago and 11% in the fiscal second quarter. The marketplace only suffered a modest profitability decline as a result, with non-GAAP operating margin dropping to 32% of sales from 34% a year ago.
After adjusting for the falling merchandise volumes, profit margin would have risen, year over year. ""Our team delivered another strong quarter,"" CEO Jamie Iannone said in a press release, ""once again meeting or surpassing our expectations for all key business metrics.""
3. Outlook on cash returns improves
Most investors' attention was focused on eBay's holiday quarter outlook that calls for another significant growth slowdown. Organic sales gains will land between 3% and 5%, executives predict, compared to 10% in the previous quarter. The forecast implies that merchandise volume will fall in a low-teens percentage range while still rising, as compared to 2019 before the pandemic scrambled demand trends.
There's a clearly improving picture on cash returns, too. eBay is now expecting to spend $7 billion on share buybacks this year, up from the $5 billion it targeted a quarter back and the $2 billion it forecast at the start of 2021.
Those upgrades are in part aimed at helping signal to Wall Street that management is bullish about the business. ""I think the eBay franchise is pretty misunderstood,"" CFO Steve Priest said in a conference call with analysts. ""One of the things that we need to do a better job [at] is really ensuring that the investor community understand a little better,"" he explained. The rising buyback is part of that focus.
More surprises ahead
eBay's short-term outlook implies more of a soft landing for the business as rising payments and advertising sales offset declining merchandise volumes compared to late 2020. Investor returns will also be amplified by those stock buybacks.
But there could be bigger surprises ahead when the company holds its annual investor event in early 2022. That announcement will include updates to eBay's longer-term goals now that pandemic demand trends have stabilized. eBay's sales offerings, its cash flow, and its profitability metrics all imply management will be ambitious in describing the platform's new financial outlook early next year.

Pinterest (NYSE:PINS) lost nearly 13% of its value on Oct. 25 because the rumor that PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) was willing to pay $70 per share for PINS stock turned out to be untrue.
Source: Nopparat Khokthong / Shutterstock.com
According to Bloomberg, PayPal issued a one-sentence denial, stating that it wasnât pursuing a Pinterest acquisition at this time. Fellow InvestorPlace contributor Joel Baglole suggested investors avoid PINS stock as a result of the takeover debacle. Baglole stated:
âWhile a potential buyout from PayPal was intriguing, a rumor is never a good reason to buy a stock. Thatâs evidenced by the fact that the PayPal acquisition failed to materialize.â
That said, I would like to point out that itâs equally silly for long-time Pinterest shareholders to sell the stock just because a rumored transaction didnât take place. Hereâs why.
PINS Stock, PayPal and the False Rumor
The first time I heard the rumor that PayPal was considering paying $45 billion for Pinterest, I immediately questioned why the payments company would make such a move. 
7 Dividend Aristocrat Stocks That Should Grace Your Portfolio
Remember, PayPal was separated from Ebay (NASDAQ:EBAY) back in 2015. Shareholders got one share in PYPL for every share of EBAY. Now, PYPL stock has outperformed EBAY almost threefold over the last five years. Clearly, itâs a superior company. 
As such, getting back into a relationship that favors one customer (Pinterest) over others doesnât seem worth it, especially if you have to shell out $45 billion to make it happen. Piper Sandler analyst Christopher Donat was also skeptical of the move. 
âWe have been skeptical of the strategic merits of the potential PINS acquisition [â¦] We view PYPLâs announcement as a clear positive, but it leaves open the possibility for PYPL to acquire PINS in the future.â
Further, Donat speculated that PayPal was merely waiting for the technology landscape to change and reduce the adverse effects of Appleâs (NASDAQ:AAPL) changes to app tracking transparency (ATT). 
While PayPal CEO Dan Schulman is interested in making a transformative acquisition, I donât see Pinterest being a good fit. However, Iâm still bullish about the current business behind PINS stock. 
More Than a Failed Acquisition
To be fair, Baglole gives several reasons other than the failed acquisition to be cautious about PINS stock. For example, co-founder Evan Sharp is leaving the company for a new gig. Plus, the companyâs user base has shrunk due to the reopening economy. Lastly, its price-earnings (P/E) ratio was âsky-highâ at the time of the article.
Let me address each of those points. 
First off, although Evan Sharp is Pinterestâs Chief Creative Officer, I donât think there is any doubt about who is driving the bus: CEO Ben Silbermann. Back in July, InvestorPlaceâs Louis Navellier quoted Silbermann on how Pinterest can last in a post-pandemic world. The CEO stated:
âWhether itâs recipe ideas during the pandemic or dream vacation planning for the future, Iâm proud that we now help 478 million people every month find inspiration to create a life they love.â
I continue to believe that a social media platform like Pinterest â a positive influence and valuable information source â is welcome in a sea of Facebooks (Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:FB))
As for Bagloleâs second point, you can argue that Pinterest lost 24 million monthly active users (MAUs) on a sequential basis from Q1 2021 to Q2 2021 â 478 million to 454 million â but you can also say that it grew MAUs in the second quarter by 9% year-over-year (YOY) and by 56% over 291 million MAUs in Q1 2019. As Iâve said before, Pinterestâs glass is half full, not half empty. 
Finally, I think itâs fair to say that the company is still growing its business and focusing on things other than bottom-line earnings. To me, it would be far better to focus on its price-to-sales (P/S) multiple of 12.9 times.
Is it too high? Too low? Or just about right?
According to Morningstar, Meta Platforms â the holding company for Facebook â is trading at 8.5 times sales while Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) and Snap (NYSE:SNAP) trade at 9 times and 21.7 times, respectively. 
So, thanks to the adverse reaction of investors for the failed transaction with PayPal, the PINS stock P/S multiple is now just right (or even a little undervalued) relative to SNAP. 
The Bottom Line on PINS Stock
Would it be nice to get $70 per share from someone like PayPal? You bet. 
On several occasions throughout 2021, PINS stock has crossed above $70, only to find its way back to the $40s, $50s or $60s. 
True, the company needs to continue to give investors reasons to stay on the Pinterest bandwagon. Itâs not enough to create takeover rumors. Professional investors can see right through that. 
Still, back in mid-September, I said that PINS was in the buy zone at $54. At around $44 today, should you take a flyer, Iâd be shocked in two to three years if you werenât thrilled with your decision to buy at current levels. And who knows? Maybe somebody else will come along with a $70 per share offer. The current median analyst estimate is pretty close at $67.   
All in all, I continue to think that Pinterest is an excellent long-term buy.

2021-11-04 00:00:00+00:00,December 23rd Options Now Available For eBay,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/december-23rd-options-now-available-for-ebay-2021-11-04,,,"Investors in eBay Inc. (Symbol: EBAY) saw new options begin trading today, for the December 23rd expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the EBAY options chain for the new December 23rd contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $76.00 strike price has a current bid of $2.80. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $76.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $73.20 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of EBAY, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $76.42/share today.
Because the $76.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 100%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 3.68% return on the cash commitment, or 27.42% annualized â at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for eBay Inc., and highlighting in green where the $76.00 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $78.00 strike price has a current bid of $2.17. If an investor was to purchase shares of EBAY stock at the current price level of $76.42/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $78.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 4.91% if the stock gets called away at the December 23rd expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if EBAY shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for eBay Inc., as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing EBAY's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $78.00 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $78.00 strike represents an approximate 2% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 2.84% boost of extra return to the investor, or 21.13% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.
Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $76.42) to be 34%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

2021-11-03 00:00:00+00:00,Is Management Strategy or Reopening Economies Driving Customer Losses for eBay?,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/is-management-strategy-or-reopening-economies-driving-customer-losses-for-ebay-2021-11-03,,,"eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY) reported third-quarter results in late October. The announcement revealed a troubling trend for the company -- it lost active buyers for the second consecutive quarter.
Since eBay is an e-commerce retailer that benefited tremendously at the pandemic's onset, it's easy to point the finger at the economic reopening as the reason customers are leaving. But a closer look under the hood reveals another potential cause for the losses.
Image source: Getty Images.
Some customers are just not worth the effort
In its third quarter ended Sept. 30, eBay reported total active buyers of 154 million, down from 159 million in the previous quarter. That makes it the second consecutive quarter the company has lost buyers. eBay peaked at 166 million active buyers in Q1 of this year before falling to 159 million in Q2. Of course, these losses coincide with the economic reopening worldwide and rapidly rising vaccination rates against COVID-19.
Consumers with more places to go and more things to buy will inevitably spread their purchases out over more businesses. There could be pent-up demand to visit stores consumers have been avoiding for the better part of a year. And if they spend money at these locations, that leaves less income to spend on eBay. This would be a legitimate reason for buyer losses.
However, there could be another reason that is at least playing a part in the losses. eBay management has shifted its focus to target high-value buyers. It says these buyers shop multiple times per year and spend more each time they buy. Additionally, they are also buyers who sometimes list items for sale. Management argues these are the customers who drive growth for the business and so deserve the increased attention.
Management discussed the matter on the company's recent earnings call:
Over the past year, we have focused on attracting and retaining high-value buyers by innovating in focused categories and targeting enthusiasts with upper funnel marketing. We have also discontinued legacy couponing that's skewed toward low-value buyers. These actions are resulting in a gradual evolution of our buyer base over time. Compared to the third quarter of 2019, high-value buyers are up 6%.
In contrast, low-value buyers are down 7% compared to the third quarter of 2019.
Active buyer losses could continue for eBay
eBay says low-value buyers make up more than 50% of overall buyers but generate 5% of the gross merchandise value (total value of transactions on eBay). Management warned that buyer losses could continue as it is focusing less on these low-value buyers. It seems then that the company's buyer losses could be just as much a result of management policy as anything else.
One of the benefits of this strategy was lower spending on sales and marketing. In its third quarter, sales and marketing as a percentage of overall sales fell to 18.8% from 22.3% in the same quarter last year. The company has historically operated at high profit margins, and this new strategy could boost them even higher -- that is, of course, if revenue does not drop substantially after losing buyers.
It's still early in this transition, and it's hard to discern the impacts from the effects of the pandemic. Regardless, it's something investors should keep an eye on that could make eBay a more attractive stock.

The bedrock for e-commerce
Shopify is on a mission to ""make e-commerce better for everyone,"" and it is doing this by offering a wide variety of solutions to help people launch, grow, market, and manage their businesses. Its tools allow merchants to sell from anywhere and manage nearly every modality of their business -- from brick-and-mortar stores to social media shops.
It not only enables customers to set up shop everywhere, but it fills out its ecosystem with payment processing, logistics, and even loans through Shopify Capital. The company was built on supporting the independence of small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs), and these supplemental services have fueled its continued growth.
Shopify has gone on to support more than just SMBs, however, as it is now attracting customers of all sizes, including big-name brands like General Mills. As of the this writing, the company has served over 1.7 million businesses around the world.
Shopify's resilient position
With a large and rapidly growing customer base, Shopify has become the second biggest company by U.S. e-commerce sales as of 2020, holding 8.6% of the total market. It has been able to beat out behemoths like Walmart and eBay because of its broad (and expanding) offering, combined with its neutrality. While Amazon helps millions of businesses establish an e-commerce presence, it competes with them at the same time, creating conflicts of interest as the platform provider.
Shopify's cumulative gross merchandise volume (GMV) reached $400 billion in the third quarter, and revenue grew 46% year over year to $1.12 billion. The company breaks out its business into two segments: merchant solutions and subscription solutions. The former primarily comes from transaction fees on GMV, and subscription revenue can range from $30 per month for entrepreneurs to over $2,000 per month for large enterprises.
The company's monthly recurring revenue -- which has been growing at a compound annual rate of 43% over the past five years -- reached $98.8 million in the latest quarter. Shopify Plus -- its subscription service for enterprises -- made up $27.2 million of that base.
With its increasing dominance within the market, the company produced $615.4 million of free cash flow in the past 12 months while holding over $7.5 billion in cash and securities. Year to date, adjusted net income of $641.5 million has more than doubled from the same period last year.
Expanding its optionality
Shopify is doing an incredible job both expanding its platform and making its current offerings more valuable. It has formed partnerships with many companies such as TikTok, where Shopify merchants can now add products that link directly to their online store checkout.
This ongoing expansion is creating sustainable optionality. In the third quarter, management announced Shopify Balance -- a money management tool -- and Shopify Markets, which will allow merchants to enter new geographies with the company's cross-border payment system so merchants can grow even more with Shopify.
The company has also been building out a fulfillment network to provide logistics and shipping solutions for merchants. This network will further strengthen Shopify's relationship with its merchants while also generating massive amounts of data to help optimize efficiency and supply chain logistics within the network.
The market sees a lot of value in these various opportunities, and Shopify trades at 57 times earnings. Despite the sticker shock, I believe it is a premium worth paying. The stock won't repeat its performance over the past five years, but it's not too late to buy in as this growth story is far from over.
A proven track record is exactly what makes Shopify a great candidate for a bedrock holding in your portfolio.

Weak revenue guidance came under the spotlight as ongoing reopenings reversed some of the temporary sales gains during the pandemic.
However, during the height of the COVID-19 crisis, new leadership made changes that could improve eBay's long-term prospects. The question for investors is whether the latest numbers point to continued stagnation or offer a path to additional growth for the internet marketplace.

Slowing growth spooks investors
Admittedly, the quarter painted a mixed picture. Gross merchandise volume (GMV) fell 10% year over year to $19.5 billion as selling activity fell from the unusually high levels in 2020. Nonetheless, eBay now retains a higher percentage of that transaction volume as revenue, which grew 11% to $2.5 billion.
Unfortunately, this top-line growth wasn't enough to drive profits higher as earnings per share fell 50% year over year to $0.43. Adjusted earnings, which exclude the effect of a fair market value adjustment for the company's Adevinta business, were up 9% to $0.90 per share. Free cash flow also fell slightly, down 4% to $502 million for the quarter.
For the current period, management is guiding for revenue growth of just 3% to 5%. This slowdown helped push shares down as much as 9% the day of the earnings release, but the stock has since mostly recovered. Year to date, eBay is still up over 50%.
Data by YCharts.
Why eBay still has room to run
A key factor investors should consider is the change in the company's direction under CEO Jamie Iannone. Previously an eBay executive, Iannone returned to the company after spearheading e-commerce sales at Walmart. Revenue was surging when he took the job in April 2020 as lockdowns drove consumers to shop online. Now, with sales slowing as economies reopen, the new environment is putting Iannone's vision to the test.
Still, in the last 18 months, Iannone has made significant changes to revive the e-commerce company and address formidable challenges from Amazon, rising e-commerce players such as Etsy, and other platforms such as Facebook Marketplace.
Under Iannone's direction, eBay reduced the steps required to list items on the site, rolling out a new listing tool to streamline this process. The company also enabled eBay storefronts on mobile devices and QR coding to make pickups faster. Additionally, the company added a managed payments system, a move that should give sellers and customers a digital wallet experience.
eBay is also targeting higher-end customers. With this change, the number of active buyers on the site fell 5% year over year to 154 million. However, more than half of this user base is what the company describes as ""low-value buyers,"" a group making up only 5% of GMV. Iannone said on the third-quarter earnings call that since 2019, the number of high-value buyers has risen 6% amid falling buyer numbers overall.
One way it has appealed to these important customers is by launching Promoted Listings Advanced Beta. This builds on its established Promoted Listings platform, allowing top-rated sellers to bid for the top slot in a given search. Revenue for promoted listings increased 9% year over year, and such moves should attract the type of sellers that will draw higher GMV and revenue over time.
With the worst of the pandemic behind us, the company is leaning into important changes that should make it more competitive long term. A better user experience and more engaged shoppers, among other efforts, are encouraging signs of what a reinvigorated eBay can look like.

In 2002, PayPal went public at $13 per share, but its time as a public company was short-lived as eBay bought it later that same year.
But PayPal would again become a public company in 2015 when it was spun off from eBay. PayPal began trading on the Nasdaq Stock Exchange on July 20, 2015, at about $41 per share. More than six years later, it has pretty much been on a rocket ship, with a total return of around 480% and an annualized return of roughly 31%, as of Oct. 28. The stock is currently trading at around $233 per share and, as the leader in the growing mobile payments industry, it should continue its robust growth. The good news for folks that don't have the capital to buy shares of this stock right now is that they can invest in PayPal for the cost of a penny stock through fractional shares investing.

PayPal has seen meteoric growth
PayPal has been one of the best growth stocks on the market over the past few years. The company is at the forefront of the digital payment revolution, as both merchants and consumers gradually move from cash to mobile and online payments. This trend has been accelerated by the pandemic, as more people shopped online and used contactless payment options. A 2020 study by Pew Research found that one-third of U.S. adults don't use cash during the week. That number will only grow over the next 10 years, 20 years, and beyond. According to Markets and Markets research, the global digital payments market is anticipated to grow at an annual rate of 14.2% between 2020 and 2025.
PayPal is perfectly positioned to ride this wave, as it is not only the largest digital payment company, it also pretty much invented the concept of online payments and was certainly a pioneer in the space. It has massive name recognition, and the number of users has climbed exponentially. As of June 30, it had 403 million active accounts, a 16% increase year over year. The number of payment transactions jumped 27% year over year to 4.7 billion, while the total payment volume (TPV) climbed 40% to $311 billion in the most recent quarter. A big component of PayPal's growth in recent years has been the Venmo mobile payment app, which saw a 58% increase in TPV to $58 billion in Q2.
By 2025, the company expects to almost double its number of active users, setting a target of 750 million. It also projects that it will double annual revenue from its current, anticipated $25 billion for 2021, to more than $50 billion in 2025, with annual free cash flow doubling to more than $10 billion. With strong cash flow, PayPal has over $19 billion in cash and cash equivalents with relative low debt -- roughly $9 billion. It has enabled PayPal to fund its growth through acquisitions, like Paidy -- a buy now, pay later provider in Japan -- and through initiatives like its new PayPal app, which bundles all of its services in one app.
Get on board the PayPal train
PayPal's stock price has shot up to around $233 per share since it went public a second time in 2015. For some investors, particularly those new to the space who may either be priced out of such a high entry point, or uncertain about allocating big chunks of capital to a stock right off the bat, fractional shares are a great option.
Many brokers now offer this option, which allows people to invest by dollar amount, not just by share price. So instead of laying down over $1,100 for five shares of PayPal, you could dip your toe in with an initial $100 investment, which would buy you about 43% of one share at its current price, and then add more over time.
You could even treat it like a penny stock, investing just a few bucks to start, if you were so inclined. PayPal would be an excellent place to start as it is a market leader that still has huge growth potential in a booming industry.

2021-10-29 00:00:00+00:00,Why eBay Stock Is Tumbling This Week,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-ebay-stock-is-tumbling-this-week-2021-10-29,,,"What happened
Shares of eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY) are bouncing back from what was at one point a 10.6% loss for the week, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. Still, even with Friday's 5% rally, the stock is set to close nearly 6% below last week's closing price. An otherwise healthy third-quarter report was tainted by lackluster earnings guidance for the quarter now underway.
So what
With the stock already in retreat from the all-time peak reached late in the previous week, Wednesday's post-close release of eBay's third-quarter earnings knocked another 6.7% off the stock's value during Thursday's trading. Last quarter's revenue of $2.5 billion was an 11% improvement on the year-ago comparison, and topped analyst estimates. Operating income of $0.90 per share also exceeded analysts' forecasts of $0.89, up from the year ago figure of $0.85.
Revenue guidance for between $2.57 billion and $2.62 billion for the fourth quarter of this year, however, doesn't compare favorably to the consensus estimate of $2.61 billion (and some are calling for even more). Those same analysts are also modeling a fourth-quarter profit of $0.99 per share versus the company's modest guidance of between $0.97 and $1.01 per share. While hardly problematic, investors were hoping for an outlook that was more compelling.
Image source: Getty Images.
Part of Thursday's knee-jerk loss was offset today, after investors had a chance to consider the company's bigger-picture prospects. But Friday's bounce still leaves the stock well short of last week's record highs.
Now what
While the recent volatility is alarming, investors who keep close tabs on eBay also know that such swings are nothing new. The stock has been taking one step back and then two steps forward since the latter part of last year, pushing its way higher on quarterly results and guidance that weren't too terribly different from those disclosed Wednesday afternoon. It's also worth noting that eBay has exceeded earnings estimates for five consecutive quarters now. It's plausible its fourth-quarter guidance will also be topped.
Whatever is in the cards, nothing has actually changed about this company's growth prospects, and the stock's corresponding potential. The recent price swing is just more of the same volatility shareholders have grown accustomed to of late.

The stock market can be overwhelming for newbies, but there are some solid foundational stocks that you should consider adding to your portfolio to get things going. Here's why PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ: PYPL) is a great stock to buy and hold even if you only have $300 to invest.
Image source: Getty Images.
Pioneering a cashless world
Society is increasingly transitioning away from cash and toward digital payments, and PayPal is at the forefront of this movement. The company provides a broad range of tools for merchants to accept payments and for individuals with their daily financial lives. Over the past five years, the booming fintech has grown quarterly sales and profit 135% and 267%, respectively. And the stock has followed this strong fundamental performance, soaring almost six-fold during this time.
Boosting PayPal's success has been the rise in online shopping. While the company will no longer be a payment solutions provider for eBay users, its products and services are definitely needed in today's economy. The pandemic only accelerated the boom in e-commerce, pushing its share of total global shopping from 14% in 2019 to 17% in 2020. This trend is likely to continue in the years ahead, supporting demand for PayPal.
In many parts of the world, cash is still the primary method of transacting today. And the fact that roughly 30% of adults worldwide still don't have an account with a financial institution or a mobile money provider is eye-opening. Because PayPal is currently available in 200 markets and supports 25 different currencies, it's well-positioned to take advantage of rising incomes and consumers joining the financial system.
Benefiting from strong competitive advantages
A business wouldn't be great without the presence of a competitive advantage. In PayPal's case, it's powered by dominant intangible assets, including a strong brand and an innovative culture. The company is globally recognized as a leader in safety, security, and speed when it comes to payments, factors that can't be compromised.
Additionally, PayPal's innovation engine is always firing, as it has proven the ability to continue introducing new features to attract more users and grow transaction volume. Last month, the company's flagship mobile app received a major upgrade, adding capabilities like bill pay, access to a high-yield savings account, early direct deposit, and even shopping deals and rewards. CEO Dan Schulman's goal is for PayPal to be a one-stop financial tool for individuals.
The competitive position is also bolstered by network effects, where the addition of more users increases the value for everyone else. Just last quarter, PayPal processed an incredible $311 billion in total payment volume (TPV). And it now counts 371 million active individual accounts and 32 million active merchant accounts. These are staggering figures by any measure, and they underscore how robust an ecosystem PayPal has built.
The company is always looking for ways to strengthen its payments platform and drive higher engagement, sometimes utilizing acquisitions to do so. PayPal previously paid $4 billion for Honey, an online tool for shopping deals and rewards. And just this year, it acquired Paidy, a leading Japanese buy now, pay later platform, for $2.7 billion. Rumors have swirled about a potential $45 billion tie-up with Pinterest as well, which would attract users of the digital visual-board social-media company, who are earlier in their shopping journey, into PayPal's ecosystem. Although PayPal ultimately said that it was not interested, it does hint at the wide possibility Schulman sees in blending the fintech world with e-commerce.
Outstanding metrics support valuation
PayPal sports some remarkable financial metrics. In the most recent quarter, an adjusted operating margin of 26.5% and an adjusted net income margin of 21.8% demonstrate how firmly profitable this enterprise is. And since the business already has the technological infrastructure in place to process massive numbers of transactions, the capital required to continue growing is minimal. PayPal invests 4% of sales in any period back into the company, which is why its free cash flow margin was a stellar 17% in the second quarter.
These financial attributes, coupled with the company's consistent and steady revenue and profit growth over the past several years, support PayPal's forward price-to-earnings ratio around 47. The stock is also down more than 20% from its recent high in late July, giving investors a chance to buy on weakness.
PayPal is a superb business, and I believe it's one of the best stocks to buy with $300 today.

2021-10-29 00:00:00+00:00,eBay Boosts Revenue in Q3 Despite Customer Purchases Decreasing,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/ebay-boosts-revenue-in-q3-despite-customer-purchases-decreasing-2021-10-29,,,"International e-commerce and auction site eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY) reported third-quarter earnings on Wednesday, Oct. 27. The company increased revenue from the same quarter last year even though it shed buyers and existing buyers spent less.
At the outset of the pandemic in 2020, eBay saw a surge of new customers and increasing engagements from existing customers. That's because folks were looking to avoid shopping in brick-and-mortar stores. Now, as increased vaccinations lower the fear of contracting COVID-19, consumers are less hesitant about shopping in person.
So, how did eBay increase revenue despite the re-opening economy? Let's take a closer look at the earnings results and see if we can find an answer.

eBay increases revenue by raising fees on sellers
Revenue at eBay increased by 11% from the same quarter last year to reach $2.5 billion in Q3. eBay generates revenue by bringing buyers and sellers together to make transactions on its platform.
At the same time, gross merchandise value (GMV), which is the total value of purchases on eBay, fell to $19.4 billion in its most recent quarter from the $21.7 billion reported the same time last year. That's a drop of 12% year over year. The fall coincides with economies reopening worldwide. This is now the second consecutive quarter where GMV has dropped year over year for eBay.
eBay generates revenue by taking a percentage of the overall value of those transactions as a fee for facilitating the exchange. eBay increased revenue despite seeing a decreased number of transactions in the quarter because it raised the fees it takes from those sales.
Along with a drop in GMV, eBay also lost active buyers in the quarter, falling to 154 million from 159 million in the previous quarter. And like GMV, active buyers have fallen in two consecutive quarters. In addition to reopening economies, management attributes the loss of buyers to its decision to eliminate promotions that attracted low-value buyers.
Still, revenue grew for eBay in the quarter because it raised the percentage of revenue it takes from sellers. That percentage rose to 12.1% from 9.7% in the same quarter last year. The third quarter makes five consecutive where the company has increased the transaction take rate. Helping to further this goal is migrating eBay's payment system away from third-party service and onto eBay. The company estimates the move will bring in $2 billion in incremental revenue in fiscal 2021.
eBay stock sell-off could be a buying opportunity
The market was disappointed with eBay's Q3 results, and the stock price was down 6% in after-hours trading following the earnings release. The consecutive losses of GMV and active buyers raise risks for investors who are unsure how much farther these losses will go.
Data by YCharts.
Moreover, eBay's stock has been on fire in 2021. Before earnings were released, the stock was trading at historically elevated levels (see chart).
The company has increased earnings per share at a compounded annual rate of 19.2% over the last decade. Its asset-lite business model keeps profits high by not spending on expensive fulfillment centers. The pullback following the earnings announcement might be a buying opportunity for long-term investors.

NEW YORK, Oct 28 (Reuters) - Wall Street closed higher on Thursday, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq boasting record closing levels thanks partly to gains by Apple and Amazon, while solid results from companies including Caterpillar and Merck helped ease concerns about slowing economic growth denting profits.
Heavyweights Tesla Inc TSLA.O, finishing up 3.8%, and Apple Inc AAPL.O, up 2.5%, spurred the Nasdaq and helped propel the index to an intraday record after the S&P 500 and Dow reached fresh peaks earlier in the week.
However, after closing up 1.6%, shares of Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O fell 3% in extended trading when it forecast holiday-quarter sales well below Wall Street expectations, as labor and supply shortages make it difficult for retailers to keep shelves stocked.
Caterpillar Inc CAT.N closed the session up 4% after reporting a better-than-expected quarterly profit on rising commodity prices, while a bullish forecast from drugmaker Merck & Co Inc MRK.N pushed its shares up 6%.
Investors also eyed Washington where President Joe Biden said he had secured a new $1.75 trillion framework for economic and climate change spending.
""Earnings continue to be very good,"" said Bill Stone, chief investment officer at the Glenview Trust Co in Louisville, Kentucky, who also noted that Biden's framework, if it succeeds, would not boost corporate taxes as investors had previously feared.
""Underneath the surface, that's a positive for corporate earnings"" going forward, said Stone.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 239.79 points, or 0.68%, to 35,730.48, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 44.74 points, or 0.98%, to 4,596.42 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 212.28 points, or 1.39%, to 15,448.12.
All 11 major S&P sectors closed higher, with Real Estate .SPLRCR, consumer discretionary .SPLRCD, and industrials .SPLRCI leading the gains.
Solid earnings also helped offset a report from the Commerce Department which showed the U.S. economy grew at a 2% annualized rate in the third quarter as COVID-19 infections flared up, short of the 2.7% estimate, while another set of data showed fewer Americans filed new claims for unemployment benefits last week as the labor market slowly improves.
""Clearly we are seeing a large batch of macroeconomic data that has been coming through during the middle of third-quarter earnings reporting season and you are seeing a little bit of a tug-of-war that exists between macroeconomic data that is appearing to be somewhat softer at the margin and corporate performance which is proving to be better than expectations,"" said Bill Northey, senior investment director at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Minneapolis.
Earnings reports have helped advance in the benchmark S&P index in 10 of the previous 12 sessions, with analysts now expecting profits for S&P 500 companies to grow 38.6% year-on-year in the third quarter.
Of the 244 S&P 500 companies that had reported by Thursday morning, 82% had beaten estimates.
However EBay Inc EBAY.O shares finished down 6.8% after the e-commerce firm forecast downbeat holiday-quarter revenue.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.15-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.46-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 34 new 52-week highs and 4 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 104 new highs and 96 new lows.
On U.S. exchanges 11.05 billion shares changed hands compared with the 10.34 billion moving average for the last 20 sessions.

NEW YORK, Oct 28 (Reuters) - Wall Street closed higher on Thursday, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq boasting record closing levels thanks partly to gains in Apple and Amazon, while solid results from companies including Caterpillar and Merck helped ease concerns about slowing economic growth denting profits.
After the bell, however, shares of both Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O and Apple Inc AAPL.O moved sharply lower following the release of quarterly results.
Amazon was down 4% in extended trading after forecasting holiday-quarter sales below Wall Street expectations. Apple fell more than 3% in late trading after it said supply-chain woes cost it $6 billion in sales in the last quarter and that the impact will be even worse in the holiday-sales quarter.
During the regular session, heavyweights including Tesla Inc TSLA.O, finishing up 3.8%, and Apple, which closed up 2.5%, spurred on the Nasdaq and the S&P.
The S&P was also boosted by Caterpillar Inc CAT.N, which closed up 4% after reporting a better-than-expected quarterly profit on rising commodity prices and a bullish forecast from drugmaker Merck & Co Inc MRK.N, which added 6%.
Investors also eyed Washington, where President Joe Biden said he had secured a new $1.75 trillion framework for economic and climate change spending.

""This marks a meaningful deceleration in the ongoing economic recovery, with GDP growth falling to its slowest rate since the COVID-19 recession,"" says Michael Reynolds, Vice President of Investment Strategy at wealth management firm Glenmede. ""However, this need not disrupt the longer-term recovery trajectory of the U.S. economy, as producers continue to shake the dust off of global supply chains.""
Initial unemployment claims plumbed another pandemic-era low, however, reaching 281,000 for the week ended Oct. 23 â 10,000 filings under the prior week and 8,000 fewer than expected.
Wall Street offered up plenty to like on the earnings front, too.
Merck (MRK, +6.1%), which is awaiting FDA approval for its COVID-19 antiviral molnupiravir, delivered Q3 revenues and earnings that whizzed past analysts' estimates. The same was true at Caterpillar (CAT, +4.1%) where construction-machinery revenues jumped by 30% from the year-ago period.

Also contributing to the day's gains were Amazon.com (AMZN, +1.6%) and Apple (AAPL, +2.5%), which ran up heading into their earnings reports, due out after Thursday's close.
The Nasdaq Composite advanced 1.4% to 15,448, surpassing its previous record close from early September, while the S&P 500 (+1.0% to 4,596) also notched a new all-time high. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.7% to 35,730) finished in the green, too.

While the social network will retain its moniker from back when CEO Mark Zuckerberg co-created it in college, the parent company's name will become ""Meta Platforms, Inc.,"" or just ""Meta"" for short, to reflect the ""metaverse"" â effectively a blending of the physical and digital/virtual worlds.
A few more things will be changing, too, including how Meta reports its financials.
""Starting with our results for the fourth quarter of 2021, we plan to report on two operating segments: Family of Apps and Reality Labs,"" the company says. (Remember, Facebook â ahem, Meta â is more than the flagship platform: It also owns Instagram, global messaging giant WhatsApp and Oculus virtual-reality gear, though the latter will also be rebranded as Meta.)
And FB shares, which were up 1.5% in reaction, will trade as MVRS starting on Dec. 1.
While Meta is taking a deep, deep dive into this emerging technology, it's hardly the only company that's positioned to profit if and when the metaverse truly takes off.

NEW YORK, Oct 28 (Reuters) - Wall Street closed higher on Thursday, boosted by gains in Apple and Amazon ahead of their earnings reports, while solid results from companies including Caterpillar and Merck helped ease concerns about slowing economic growth denting profits.
High-profile stocks Tesla Inc TSLA.O, Apple Inc AAPL.O and Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O boosted the Nasdaq and helped propel the index to a record after the S&P 500 and Dow reached fresh peaks earlier in the week.
Both Apple and Amazon were scheduled to post quarterly results after the closing bell.
Caterpillar Inc CAT.N added rose after reporting a better-than-expected quarterly profit on rising commodity prices, while a bullish forecast from drugmaker Merck & Co Inc MRK.N helped boost its shares.
Investors were also keeping an eye on Washington where President Joe Biden said he had secured a new $1.75 trillion framework for economic and climate change spending.
""Earnings continue to be very good,"" said Bill Stone, chief investment officer at the Glenview Trust Co in Louisville, Kentucky, who also noted that Biden's framework, if it succeeds, would not boost corporate taxes as investors had previously feared.
""Underneath the surface, that's a positive for corporate earnings"" going forward, said Stone.
According to preliminary data, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 44.85 points, or 0.98%, to end at 4,596.25 points, while the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC gained 212.28 points, or 1.39%, to 15,448.12. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 236.94 points, or 0.67%, to 35,727.63.
Solid earnings also helped offset a report from the Commerce Department which showed the U.S. economy grew at a 2% annualized rate in the third quarter as COVID-19 infections flared up, short of the 2.7% estimate, while another set of data showed fewer Americans filed new claims for unemployment benefits last week as the labor market slowly improves.
""Clearly we are seeing a large batch of macroeconomic data that has been coming through during the middle of third-quarter earnings reporting season and you are seeing a little bit of a tug-of-war that exists between macroeconomic data that is appearing to be somewhat softer at the margin and corporate performance which is proving to be better than expectations,"" said Bill Northey, senior investment director at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Minneapolis.
Earnings reports have helped advance in the benchmark S&P index in 10 of the previous 12 sessions, with analysts now expecting profits for S&P 500 companies to grow 38.6% year-on-year in the third quarter.
Of the 244 S&P 500 companies that had reported by Thursday morning, 82% had beaten estimates.
Among the decliners however was EBay Inc EBAY.O whose shares tumbled after the e-commerce firm forecast downbeat holiday-quarter revenue.
