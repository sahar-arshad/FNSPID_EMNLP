This video was recorded on July 29, 2021.
Chris Hill: It's Thursday, July 29th. Welcome to MarketFoolery. I'm Chris Hill. With me, for the first time in a while, it's John Rotonti. Thanks for being here.
John Rotonti: Thanks, Chris. Glad to be here.
Hill: We got more earnings. It's one of those weeks. We're going to talk PayPal, we're going to talk iRobot, we're going to start with the social network. Facebook's second-quarter revenue came in just north of $29 billion. It's interesting because Facebook, it's not like their ad inventory is getting dramatically larger but they've demonstrated their ability to charge more for ads, and you got to like that pricing power if you're a shareholder.
Rotonti: That's exactly right. Their revenue grew 50% constant currency in the quarter. Of that top-line growth, 6% came from growth in the number of ads or the number of impressions but 47% increase in the price per ad. Like you said, that's a lot of pricing power. On some level, it does show that businesses of all sizes, excuse me, are willing to pay Facebook more for better ad placement, higher ROI, higher return on their ad spend and then better, more effective measurement of the effectiveness of those ads, so they're willing to pay Facebook more.
Hill: I know Facebook gets a lot of attention for a lot of other things that have nothing to do with advertising. I think it's easy to lose sight of the fact that they are really, really good at this. In the same way that Google is really good at search, Facebook is really good at the business of advertising.
Rotonti: I think they are the best at the business of advertising. In my opinion, I think they are the best.
Hill: How big is the Oculus for them? For those unfamiliar, this is their virtual reality goggles headset. As someone who is watching a decent amount of the Summer Olympics, I'm seeing a lot of ads that Facebook is doing for the Oculus and it seems like this is something they are very serious about from a business standpoint. It's not just, ""Oh, this is a fun thing to play with."" It seems like the business aspirations around Oculus are pretty lofty or do I have that wrong?
Rotonti: No, I think you have that right, Chris. They break out their revenue by advertising and then other, most of the other is Oculus. I think that grew somewhere in the neighborhood of 30-35% this quarter if memory serves, which is great. The Oculus 2, their second version of the virtual reality headset has gotten rave reviews, and I've read probably 10 or more, a dozen reviews and it's gotten rave reviews. More important than the growth that it's seeing in Oculus is that VR and AR is a major investment area for Zuckerberg and Facebook. Not only are they investing in Oculus and the Quest, but they're coming out with smart glasses in partnership with Ray-Ban and Ray-Ban's parent company. But all of that Chris is a part of Mark Zuckerberg's vision for the next stage of Facebook. In a lot of ways, this was one of the most important calls I think in Facebook history, because Mark Zuckerberg talked about how he wants to transition the company over the next several years from being primarily a social media company into a metaverse company. He laid out in the call and in some interviews he's done recently with The Verge, for example. But he laid out on the call what the metaverse is, he defined it, and how Facebook may play a role in building out this metaverse, and VR and Oculus will play a role in that.
Hill: I'm trying to wrap my head around this because as someone who's had the chance to try virtual reality goggles and that thing, it's pretty compelling. But it's pretty compelling from the standpoint of this is a fun thing to do. From a business standpoint, there are a lot of investors who get a little nervous when they hear about CEOs saying, ""We're shifting our business."" If you're a longtime shareholder of Facebook, you're happy with how the business has been run. Is this a situation where you look at what Zuckerberg and his team, this pivot they're trying to do, is at the expense of the up until now, highly lucrative social network they have built or is this like, ""No, we're going to keep that golden goose producing those eggs. But meanwhile, we're going to invest a lot of money into Oculus. We're not going to build the Oculus and the metaverse at the expense of the existing business.""
Rotonti: Totally. Two things there. One is, Zuckerberg has trained his investor base, he's trained his shareholders from very early days and earnings calls to look at the long term. He has always laid out five-, seven-, and 10-year plans. That's one thing. Yes, the stock is selling off a bit today but Facebook investors I think are accustomed to this long-term shift. The other thing is, one of the key aspects of a metaverse is that there are going to be these economies in these virtual worlds. Facebook I believe if they're successful will be able to transition a lot of their advertising business, a lot of what their ability and e-commerce and payments over into the virtual worlds. It's not a shift so much from an economic point of view, I think it will be able to maintain good economics but I think Zuckerberg thinks that the next internet platform is going to be the metaverse. Facebook is clearly a major internet player now and so if they want Facebook to be a major internet player in the future, then it has to do so in this next paradigm shift which is the metaverse.
Hill: Shares of PayPal are down 6% this morning despite second-quarter profits coming in higher than expected. Earlier in the week, PayPal was close to an all-time high. I talked to Tim Byers yesterday about this with Starbucks. Just like with Starbucks, there was a lot to like in their quarter but there were enough things that weren't amazing that the stock sold off a little bit similar to PayPal. There's a lot to like here, total payment volume of 40%, but it seems like with PayPal there are enough short-term question marks that I get why you combine that with the stock close to an all-time high, I get why it's selling off a little bit today.
Rotonti: Yeah. Sometimes stocks sell off just because of what you said, just because they need to take a breather, sometimes they just had an all-time high. Could be a little of that. I think though that the investors are digesting what this drag from eBay, losing eBay business is going to be. What I mean by that is they're quantifying it, how much of a drag is it going to be going forward? I think PayPal suggested on the call that it's a little more of a drag than management originally expected, so there's that eBay drag. Also, the take rate is falling at PayPal, the amount that basically they charge to use their service. One question investors may be asking is, is this from increased competition? Are they having to lower prices? Because yes, PayPal's building is an amazing super app. It's got huge functionality across a lot of different use cases. I own PayPal, but also Square. Square is building a super app, so is SoFi. SoFi is building a super app. They guided a little light on revenue, we don't know if that guidance came in a little light because of eBay or because they're seeing increased competition from the likes of Square and PayPal or maybe a little bit of both.
Hill: It's a great point about the competition because for all the success that they've had, particularly with things like Venmo, it makes sense that Square is doing what they're doing, they're not just going to cede the ground to PayPal like, ""Well, that's it. I guess they won.""
Rotonti: Totally, Chris, I think that digital payments is such a massive addressable market, the size of the market, and then it's growing so rapidly. I don't think we have to pick just one. This is one of those ones when I think a basket is a fine approach. I own PayPal and Square as well as Visa and MasterCard. You can have a basket that includes PayPal, Square, SoFi, any of these players. I'm not worried about PayPal though, it's one of the largest digital platform companies in the world. It's riding these long-term trends toward the digitization of cash, and basically, electronic e-commerce and mobile commerce. It's got huge brands in Venmo, Xoom, Braintree, and Paydiant, all of which help make financial transactions easier and more secure for both merchants and consumers. I mentioned both because this is a two-sided network; it's got over 400 million combined users when you count merchants and users on the platform, and that network effect combined with a trusted brand drives really attractive growth. I see this as a high-teens grower. In some quarters, maybe they reach 20%-plus growth for a fairly long period of time. Intermediate-term, five to seven years, I think this is a high-teens grower and it's growing very profitably, Chris.
Hill: An important point there adding that they're not just growing, they're growing profitably. Last thing and then we will move on, is it safe to assume that three months from now, and I realize this might be annoying for some of the dozens of listeners, but every now and then, and this is one of those situations where when I really digest a company's earnings report, my main side is I can't wait to get to the next one, I can't wait for three months from now because I hear everything you're saying and I think to myself, ""OK, so in three months, I'm assuming we're going to know more about the take rate and is that a speed bump or is that something that they are able to have bounced back?"" We're going to know more about the eBay drag that you mentioned, like how long and how impactful is it?
Rotonti: Yeah. I think we'll know a little bit more in a quarter and I think we'll know a lot more in a year. Even if the take rate trends down slowly over time, it's not the end of the world, they can make that up with volume. Like I said, this is a super app, it offers peer-to-peer money transfer, it offers remittance across borders, it offers credit, it offers small loans to businesses, crypto by selling and holding crypto and now buy now, pay later, which grew something like 49% or 50% in the quarter. It is quickly becoming, and by it, I mean the PayPal app, the super app, it's quickly becoming a utility in our daily lives. I'm not terribly worried, but yes, next quarter we'll know a little more.
Hill: iRobot's second-quarter revenue grew 31%, demand is up for the Roomba and other cleaning robots. But there is a semiconductor chip shortage that you may have heard something about, and not surprisingly, that is having an impact on iRobot's business.
Rotonti: It's so funny going through this, not funny, but just enlightening going through this earning season and discovering all of the companies that are being affected by the global semiconductor shortage. I cover semiconductors shifts at The Motley Fool. It is really eye-opening how important these tiny chips are to our daily lives. Thirty percent growth is phenomenal. Some of that is pandemic-driven because during the pandemic the economy shut down, we were all forced to, or many of us were forced to work from home, learn from home, exercise from home, game from home, and so we're spending more time at home so people were buying robotic vacuums. That 30% growth makes sense.
Hill: You and I were chatting before we started recording about the five-year chart on iRobot. This is a stock, you go back to the summer of 2016, the stock has a little bit more than doubled since that. You get a double over a five-year period, that's great. Historically, that's a market-beating return. But the roller coaster that investors have been on over the past five years is terrifying. Depending on when you bought shares of iRobot, you're either thrilled or horribly disappointed.
Rotonti: iRobot is one of the companies that -- such a great point, Chris -- it's one of the companies that faces really steep competition. Even though it's this great innovative product that many of us probably use and love better than pushing the vacuum ourselves, especially the heavy type of vacuums on carpet and stuff, it is facing competition from the likes of Dyson, which is another brilliant engineering company, from the likes of Shark, the Shark IQ, and there's others out there as well. Over the last five years, the chart that you're looking at, I believe iRobot has tried to increase prices at least once, maybe twice, and those prices didn't stick, it had to actually roll them back, and so we were talking about the pricing power we are seeing at Facebook. This is the opposite. They have tried to increase the price at least once that I remember reading about and maybe more than once and they didn't stick. What you see is that the gross margin line at iRobot, which is a rough indicator of pricing power, has fallen from 49% to 50% in 2016 and 2017 to 45%, 46%, and then most recently down to 42%. The volatility that you see in the gross margin line, I think, is leading to the volatility that you see in the stock price. It's going to be interesting to see if they can get the last 12 months gross margin of 42%, if they can get that back up into the mid-40% range.
Hill: Thank you for that reminder because I had forgotten about that incident where they tried to raise prices and it backfired on them. Among other things, it's a reminder that, in general, when it comes to consumer technology, I feel like we can put iRobot and the Roomba in the consumer technology space. In general, prices come down over time. A very good flat-screen TV costs you a lot less now than it did five and 10 years ago. Apple really is the outlier in its ability to continue to keep the iPhone at a high price point. You go back 10, 12 years, the first few years of the iPhone, the people who were bearish on Apple, part of their bearish argument was, ""Well, look at the history of consumer technology prices, they can't possibly keep this up. They're going to have to lower the price of the iPhone over time."" In fact, they did the exact opposite.
Rotonti: It's exactly right, and in order to maintain that pricing power, those average selling prices, you have to continually innovate and add new functionality and new features which Apple has been able to do largely with the iPhone. The thing we should mention about iRobot because you said depending on when you got on that roller coaster you either really enjoyed it or you felt sick to your stomach. One future investors, they like about this, is the stock is not terribly expensive right now, it's trading eighty-something dollars per share, its 52-week high was almost $200 per share, and on a price-to-free-cash-flow basis, it's trading at like a multiple of 15, which is low, Chris, that is low and the reason it's low is because it is such a volatile business, I think. The predictability of the business is not predictable, and so people aren't going to pay high multiples for it. But if you invert that price-to-free-cash-flow multiple, you get a free cash flow yield, and that's a yield of 7%. The higher the yield, the better, a 7% yield that compares to the 10-year Treasury note at 1.3%. A 7% yield also means that free cash flow doesn't have to grow a whole lot to generate mid-teens annualized return, free cash flow only has to grow 6%, 7%. You add the yield plus the growth, 7% yield, let's say 6% or 7% growth, and you get to mid-teens expected return. Now, it's not a guaranteed return, but it's a rough heuristic to calculate that. Maybe it's a decent time to buy this one. I don't know the company well enough to say any more than that, but it doesn't look terribly expensive here.
Hill: John Rotonti, great talking to you. Thanks so much for being here.
Rotonti: Thank you, Chris. Always love being on the show.

Aug 12 (Reuters) - Wall Street's main indexes were set to open flat on Thursday as investors weighed data showing a steady jobs market recovery against a rise in producer prices, ahead of earnings reports from major companies including Walt Disney.
The Labor Department's report showed the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits fell last week, as expected, while a separate reading showed U.S. producer prices rose more than expected through July.
The inflation reading came on the heels of data that showed growth in consumer prices appeared to be slowing. The consumer price index and personal consumption data are usually the preferred inflation gauges of the Federal Reserve when altering monetary policy.
""The inflationary transitory camp is winning the debate and as the fear of inflation somewhat ebbs ... equities have a certain tendency to outperform,"" said Sebastien Galy, senior macro strategist at Nordea Asset Management.
The benchmark S&P 500 .SPX and the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI logged record closing highs on Wednesday, as investors moved into economy-linked value stocks from technology-heavy shares following the passage of a large infrastructure bill.
The S&P 500 value index .IVX has gained 2% so far this month and is on track to outperform its growth counterpart .IGX for the first time since June.
""They're mostly cyclical, are cheap, and therefore people feel more comfortable about holding value, particularly if they think that the business cycle is going to improve going forward, as evidenced by lower inflation and a better labor market,"" Galy said.
At 8:55 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis 1YMcv1 were up 27 points, or 0.08%, S&P 500 e-minis EScv1 were down 1.75 points, or 0.04%, and Nasdaq 100 e-minis NQcv1 were down 27.75 points, or 0.18%.
In earnings-related moves, Baidu Inc's BIDU.O U.S. shares fell 2.2% even after the company posted upbeat quarterly revenue, buoyed by a rebound in advertising sales and higher demand for its artificial intelligence and cloud products.
EBay Inc EBAY.O slipped 1.2% after forecasting third-quarter revenue below analysts' estimates, signaling that reopening economies and vaccine rollouts could be putting an end to the pandemic-led shopping boom.
Palantir Technologies Inc PLTR.N gained 9.5% after the U.S. data analytics firm beat Wall Street estimates for quarterly revenue and forecast current-quarter sales above expectations.

Aug 12 (Reuters) - Futures tracking the Dow hit a record high on Thursday ahead of earnings reports from companies including Walt Disney and data expected to show a jobs market recovery was on track.
The Labor Department's report - due at 0830 a.m. ET (1230 GMT) - is likely to show the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits fell further in the week ended Aug. 7.
Focus will also be on U.S. producer prices data after soft inflation figures for July on Wednesday assuaged fears of sooner-than-expected policy tightening by the Federal Reserve.

It was a slow but steady up-day in the stock market, with the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average hitting new all-time highs. That said, let’s look at a few top stock trades as we enter the last trading session of the week.
Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 1: Tesla (TSLA)

Click to Enlarge
Source: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider
When was the last time Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) traded in this tight of a range? Shares continue to hold up over the $700 area we’ve highlighted, while the 10-day moving average is also coming into play as support.
From here, though, we need some more decisive action. Eventually, it will come. We either need a rotation over $727 or a drop below $697.
If it’s the latter, see if the 21-day moving average supports the stock. Otherwise, the 50-day and 200-day moving averages are in play. If we get a rotation over $727, the $781 level is on the table, which is the prior gap-fill area and the April high.

7 Tech Stocks to Avoid Until They Turn Things Around
Aggressive bulls can be long against $695 or so and look for a push into the $720s. More conservative traders will wait for one of these two rotations to play out before taking a position.
Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 2: eBay (EBAY)

Click to Enlarge

eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) started to move lower on earnings, but churned out some gains on the day — up about 1.3%.
Amid today’s push higher, shares are reclaiming the 10-day and 50-day moving averages. If eBay clears the 21-day moving average, look for a push above $70. Above $70 puts the $73 gap-fill level on the table.
On the downside, however, a fade back below the 50-day moving average leaves Thursday’s low vulnerable. Below that level (at $66.36), the key $65 level is on the table. If shares close below $65, then the 200-day moving average could be in play.
Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 3: Clover (CLOV)

Click to Enlarge
Source: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider
Clover (NASDAQ:CLOV) is also moving on earnings, but it’s jumped up a much more robust 10.8% on the day. That’s a far cry from where it was trading, though, as shares were up as much as 18.7% on the day.
That fade is only disappointing because the stock has had trouble clearing the $9.25 to $9.50 area multiple times in the past few months. So what do we want to see?
At the very least, I would love to see Clover close over this month’s high, at $9.23. However, a monthly-up rotation would be even more attractive, with a close over $9.45. If we get that, the 200-day and 50-day moving averages could be in play, followed by the $11.25 level.

3 EV Stocks to Buy to Make a Fortune
On the downside, though, a move below the 10-day moving average puts critical support in play, at $7.90.
Top Trades for Tomorrow No. 4: Nio (NIO)

Click to Enlarge
Source: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider
If we talk about one leading EV stock, we need to talk about the other — especially when it reports earnings. Nio (NYSE:NIO) isn’t plunging on its results, but it didn’t exactly trade well. Shares fell about 3.4% on the day.
While that’s not a big loss for a stock like Nio, it was a rather decisive move. What I mean by that is, Nio was chopping around its 21-day, 50-day and 200-day moving averages.
Had the stock broken higher by a few percent, it would be clearing all of these measures, allowing them to set up as potential support down the road. In turn, they’re going to act as potential resistance now that Nio is breaking lower from this spot.
On the downside, keep an eye on Thursday’s low and the 50-week moving average. A break of this area could put the July low in play at $38.66. Below that, and the mid- to low-$30s are on the table.
On the upside, however, Nio needs to reclaim its 50-day and 200-day moving averages. It’s that simple.

Aug 11 (Reuters) - EBay Inc EBAY.O missed Wall Street estimates for quarterly revenue on Wednesday and the e-commerce firm forecast current-quarter sales below estimates, signaling opening up of economies and vaccine rollouts could fade the pandemic-led shopping boom.
In the past year, customers turned to e-commerce platforms during the coronavirus pandemic as they were home-bound for months at a stretch, but vaccine rollouts are expected to lead a return to brick-and-mortar shopping as more people step out of their homes.
EBay also faces competition in its marketplace business from larger rivals including Amazon.com AMZN.O and Walmart Inc's WMT.N online business.
EBay said it expects third-quarter revenue in the range of $2.42 billion to $2.47 billion, while analysts were expecting $2.92 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
The company's second-quarter revenue rose to $2.68 billion, but fell short of analysts' expectation of $3.00 billion.
On an adjusted basis, the company earned 99 cents per share, above analysts' estimate of 95 cents.

Additionally, all revenue and GMV growth rates mentioned in Jamie's and Steve's remarks represent FX-neutral year-over-year comparisons unless they indicate otherwise.

With that, let me turn it over to Jamie.
Jamie Iannone -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Joe. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, I'll begin the call with key highlights from the second quarter. Then I'll share some updates on the progress toward our strategic vision. At the end of my remarks, I will turn the call over to Steve, our new CFO, who will discuss our financial performance and outlook in greater detail. The second quarter of 2021 marked several important milestones in the ongoing transformation of eBay, and I want to thank our team for making it happen. We've accelerated our pace of innovation while executing several complex transactions.
Their dedication and focus have created tremendous value for our customers and shareholders. Let me start with a few of our portfolio enhancements. We completed the transition of eBay's Classified business to Adevinta. This deal was originally valued at approximately $9.2 billion, but a closing in June had appreciated to $13.3 billion. Shortly after closing, we announced a deal with Permira to sell approximately 135 million of our Adevinta shares for over $2.4 billion. This agreement fulfills regulatory commitments while returning value to eBay shareholders. We also increased our share buyback plan for the year from $2 billion to $5 billion. In June, we announced the sale of over 80% of our Korean business to Emart for approximately $3 billion, bringing together two leading e-commerce and retail companies that can unlock significant potential in Korea.
We anticipate the deal will close either later this year or in early 2022. These portfolio changes allow us to intensify our focus on the core eBay business moving forward. When I spoke to you last July, I outlined a renewed vision and strategic plan for the company. We set out on a multiyear journey to become the best global marketplace for sellers and buyers, through a tech-led reimagination. Our priorities were to grow the core, become the platform of choice for sellers and to cultivate life-long trusted relationships with buyers, by turning them into enthusiasts. To-date, our progress is very encouraging.
Our underlying growth is positive, and the strategy is working. Q2 results were strong and all key business metrics met or exceeded expectations. Revenue grew 11% driven by acceleration in the Payments migration and advertising growth. We funded incremental investments in product development while delivering $0.99 of non-GAAP EPS above the high-end of our range. As expected, GMV declined 11% when compared to last year when results were heavily impacted by the initial pandemic lockdown. Importantly, compared to pre-pandemic levels two years ago, we are seeing positive underlying GMV growth.
Our customer metrics remain healthy on both sides of our marketplace. Active sellers grew 5% to 19 million globally, as more small businesses and consumers continue to turn to eBay's global platform to reach millions of potential customers from around the world. This quarter, global active buyers totaled 159 million, down 2% versus last year, and up 3% versus 2019. We've been focused on building lifelong trusted relationships with enthusiast buyers. Changes in our marketing mix and product investments have been focused on attracting and retaining these enthusiasts particularly Gen Z and millennials.
In parallel, we've discontinued legacy tactics that led to low value, infrequent or one and done buyers. Our buyer base is starting to evolve based on this strategy. These high-volume buyers are growing compared to a year-ago and their spend on eBay is growing even faster. This higher-quality mix of buyers increases value for sellers and will lead to improved health of our ecosystem over the long-term. Moving on from buyer trends to Payments and Advertising initiatives continued to deliver a simpler product experience and meaningful benefits for sellers, buyers and shareholders. Managed Payments is now live in every market globally, and the transition is progressing faster than expected.
During the second quarter, we processed 71% of on-platform buying through managed Payments. We exited Q2 at a run rate over 80% and are on track to process over 90% this quarter. Managing the Payments experiences ourselves enables us to eliminate a pain point that sellers occasionally face on eBay, unpaid items. Changes to checkout have been made to address this issue and today 99% of fixed-price transactions are paid up front. We have also started to address this issue for best offers and options, by asking buyers to provide a Payment method in order to bid. This is a significant win for sellers, as it frees up inventory and reduces their post-transaction costs.
Our Advertising business continues to perform well. In Q2, ad revenue outpaced volume driven by Promoted Listings, which delivered almost $224 million, up 8%. More than 1.4 million sellers promoted over 430 million listings during the quarter. Growth was driven by higher adoption and technology improvements that increased conversion. We see tremendous growth opportunities in advertising, both from our existing Promoted Listings offerings, and from new product innovations. Following a number of successful trials in Q2, we are scaling several new products globally over the next few months. Previously, sellers could only promote fixed-price listings, but now they can increase visibility for a flat fee on options to increase conversion. In June, we also introduced a cost-per-click ad product to sellers in our major markets. Initial results from the first 100,000 listings showed that sellers' return on ad spend was higher than industry benchmarks.
We are placing more AI-powered recommendations for pricing and keyword bidding into the Seller Hub to help sellers drive particular volume. Finally, we're beginning to syndicate ads off eBay platforms to drive more buyers to listings. Importantly, sellers maintain control of pricing and visibility while benefiting from the scaled marketing capabilities of eBay. In addition to Advertising and Payments, we're driving a number of other sitewide initiatives. For consumer sellers, we're simplifying the selling process with a heavy focus on mobile. This includes easier label printing solutions in the app, and faster listings through image or bar code scans.
In trading cards where we first launched image-based listings sellers are able to match scans over 80% of the time. The time it takes to create a listing has been dramatically reduced and we plan to expand the capability to more product categories later this year. For small business sellers, we continue to expand and optimize their eBay toolkit. To help drive repeat business from enthusiasts to eBay stores, we built a CRM tool that enables sellers to fund and distribute their own coupons. Since launching a few months ago, over 1 million buyers have purchased items through these targeted campaigns.
As you've heard me say in the past, we are focused on a number of categories where we are well-positioned to serve both sellers and buyers. These categories are growing significantly faster than the overall business, and I'm delighted with the progress our team is making. Our innovation playbook has included increasing customer satisfaction, improving trust, growing supply and marketing to enthusiasts. As we exited Q2, we have applied this playbook to approximately 10% of our volume across our top three markets. With our current plan and ongoing momentum, we expect to expand coverage to approximately 20% by the end of the year.
One of these categories is trading cards. In North America, we continue to see substantial growth with approximately $2 billion of GMV in the first half of the year, equal to all of 2020. Despite these strong results, we see additional untapped potential in the market that we plan to capture with further innovation. We recently launched price guide and collection tools, aimed at trading card enthusiasts. These new features leverage unparalleled inventory and pricing data, allowing customers to view, manage and track the value of their collections in real-time. As a leader in trading cards with 25 years of transactional data, no one is better positioned to estimate the value of every card ever sold.
In addition, the collection tool seamlessly tracks all eBay activity and offline inventory in one place. This makes it easy for enthusiasts to assess opportunities, quickly trade and increase the value of their collections. Sneakers and watches continue to outgrow our overall marketplace. Since launching one year ago, we have authenticated nearly 1 million items enabling a game-changing level of trust. Both categories are seeing close to 90% customer satisfaction rates on authenticated transactions. Our Sneakers business saw strong double-digit growth despite tougher comps from a year-ago, and based on this success, we've expanded sneaker authentication to the UK, Canada, an Australia.
Luxury watches are also sustaining double-digit growth. Improved buyer trust is leading to strong cross-category shopping behavior similar to what we have seen in sneakers. In fact, luxury watch buyers spent 8,000 dollars on more than 50 items in other categories well-above the average eBay buyer. The next luxury category we are focused on is handbags. We plan to leverage a similar playback from watches and sneakers to deliver higher NPS for buyers and sellers. We've started in the U.S. for authenticating handbags over $500 for major brands. Refurbished electronics continues to be another area of growth across our largest markets.
Our Certified Refurbished experience is strengthening relationships with best-in-class brands by opening new sales channels. We recently welcomed Samsung Galaxy to the program, providing eBay buyers access to exclusive, like-new products at exceptional prices. Vehicles parts and accessories has historically been one of the strongest-performing categories on eBay, and remain so today. Our platform offers a wide inventory selection supported by a robust catalog. The Fitment shopping experience matches car parts to vehicles, to help buyers shop efficiently and confidently. In Q2 we expanded this capability by enabling a motorcycle parts finder in Germany and the UK.
We also expanded the My Garage feature, which allows buyers to store their vehicle data, leading to a more tailored shopping experience, to Canada, Italy, France and Spain. We plan to launch more technology-driven innovations in this category later this year to further build on our success. Taking a step back, eBay exists to create economic opportunity for all. That purpose guides our approach to our customers, our communities and our team at eBay. This year, our leadership team's individual goals focus on accelerating meaningful change in diversity, equity and inclusion, throughout every level of our company. We formed an ESG council, composed of senior leaders across the company whose role is to guide and ensure the success of sustainability initiatives.
During the quarter, we published our fifth annual Impact Report and third annual Diversity, Equity and Inclusion report detailing the progress we made in the past year as well as outlining our 2025 goals. The full list of activities is extensive, but I would like to share a few highlights. We made progress on our journey to be more diverse, equitable and inclusive. Our communities of inclusion have conducted 150 events with more than 10,000 attendees in the past year. We've also continued multiyear efforts to ensure gender pay equity, resulting in 100% pay parity in the U.S. and 99.7% globally. Another priority is managing our environmental impact.
Investing in clean energy is a focus for the company and our goal is to source 100% renewable energy by 2025. We have already reached 74% of our goal through a combination of power purchase agreements and local programs. Just last week, we announced that we are teaming up with McDonald's in an agreement with Lightsource bp to purchase power from Louisiana's largest solar project. The electricity produced will be greater than the power used at our largest data center. Finally, I would like to call out the incredible generosity of our buyers and sellers. During Q2, customers contributed over $35 million to their favorite causes through eBay for Charity.
This represented a 16% growth versus last year, and the platform is on track to hit the 2025 goal of raising $600 million. These are just a sample of the ongoing ESG-related activities and I encourage you to check out more at ebayinc.com. Q2 was another step forward in the multiyear transformation of eBay. The business delivered strong results and it's clear that our strategy is working. Customers are delighted with the innovation in our focus categories, leading divine growth despite tougher comps from a year-ago. We are harnessing the power of next-gen technology to make eBay the seller platform of choice and to attract lifelong enthusiasts.
Our Payments transition is nearly complete, delivering benefits to sellers, buyers and shareholders. Our advertising product portfolio is expanding, giving sellers more tools to grow their business, and we simplified our portfolio enabling us to focus on the core, while creating significant shareholder value. Our team continues to be relentlessly focused on executing for our customers. I'm delighted to welcome four new exceptional leaders to our executive team this year. In addition, we've hired critical talent in areas such as technology, AI, analytics and category management. The teams in place are well-positioned to propel this business forward.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Steve to provide more details on our financial performance. Before I do, I want to say how excited I am to have another world-class customer centric leader on our team to help us realize our vision.
Steve, over to you.
Steve Priest -- Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer
Thank you, Jamie, and thank you all for joining today. I would like to start by saying how excited and honored I am to be at eBay. I'd also like to thank Andy for this leadership and guidance during my transition into the role. He's done an excellent job creating value for the company and leading our finance team over the last couple of years. I'll start on page 4 of our presentation. We've outlined the impact of moving our Korean business to Discontinued Operations, and our guidance for Q2 earnings. At an aggregated level this reduced guidance by approximately 2 points of GMV growth, $400 million of revenue and $0.02 of EPS.
The Q2 results purely reflect the performance of our continued Marketplace business. On July 13, we published the Form 8-K that includes the recasted historical financial statements back to the start of 2019. These figures provide an apples-to-apples comparison versus our actual results. Excluding Korea, the implied Q2 guidance was between $2.58 billion and $2.63 billion of revenue growing 8% to 10% on an organic FX-neutral basis. Non-GAAP EPS was between $0.89 and $0.94 per share representing a decrease of 5% to 10% year-over-year. Turning to our highlights from the quarter on slide 5, despite lapping an exceptional quarter last year, we delivered strong operational results.
Revenue grew double digits, driven by Payments and ads. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.99 per share, and our operating margin was 33%. We generated $910 million of free cash flow while returning $1.6 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and cash dividends. We generated significant value from our portfolio as we work to transform eBay. We announced the agreement to sell over 80% of our Korean business to Emart for approximately $3 billion. We completed the Classifieds transaction, for a total value of $13.3 billion including $2.5 billion in cash, and a 44% stake in Adevinta. We then reached an agreement to sell a quarter of that steak to Permira for over $2.4 billion in cash.
Finally, we increased our estimated 2021 share buyback to $5 billion for an initial $2 billion. Moving to Active Buyers on slide 6, we executed the quarter with 159 million buyers representing a 2% decrease year-over-year on a trailing 12-month basis. At the beginning of the pandemic, in Q2 last year, we added more than 7 million buyers, our largest quarterly increase ever. That cohort of buyers has matured in-line with historical trends. We are also seeing a reduction in buyers of low-priced items due to changes in our marketing mix. As Jamie mentioned our strategy to attract and retain buyers has changed over the past several quarters.
We've intentionally focused our marketing and product innovation on higher-valued buyers. These include buyers who sell, or buyers who purchase at least six days a year and spend over $800. This high-value segment represents approximately 20% of our buyer base and they purchase around 75% of our GMV. High-value buyers grew in Q2 as did the spend per buyer. Low value buyers on eBay make approximately half of our buyer base, but only purchase about 5% of our GMV. As we drive [Indecipherable] we expect to see a further drop in active buyers on a rolling 12-month basis but an increase in GMV per buyer over the coming quarters.
Moving to slide 7, in Q2 we delivered $22.1 billion of GMV, down 11% year-over-year. On a spot basis, this represents a decrease of 7% year-over-year. Compared with Q2 of 2019, GMV grew 19% on an FX-neutral basis, and 23% on a spot basis. There were several factors that contributed to the Q2 GMV dynamic. First, we lapped the peak of the early impact of the pandemic, including the first wave of mobility restrictions, stimulus payments and supply chain disruptions. Second, there was a meaningful ongoing macro benefit from global mobility, although it was significantly less at the end of the quarter, than at the beginning of Q2.
And third, our underlying business continued to show positive growth from sitewide product experience improvements and category performance. In the U.S. we generated approximately $10 billion of GMV in Q2, down 5% year-over-year. International GMV decreased 16% year-over-year to $12.1 billion. Our U.S. volume outpaced international primarily due to strength in trading cards, as well as benefits from government stimulus earlier in the quarter. Turning to revenue on slide 8, our net revenue for the quarter was $2.7 billion, up 11% on an FX-neutral basis and up 14% on a spot basis.
We delivered $2.5 billion of transaction revenue, up 11% year-over-year, mainly driven by payments. We continue to make great progress on seller migration. As Jamie mentioned, 71% of our global on-platform volume was processed through Managed Payments during the quarter, which contributed approximately 18 points of incremental revenue growth year-over-year. The success of the Payments ramp also drove quarterly acceleration of 80 basis points to our transaction take rate, which is 11.3% for the quarter. We expect this rate to continue to grow throughout 2021, as we complete the Payments rollout.
We delivered $172 million of Marketing Services & Other revenue, up 11% year-over-year driven by strength in shipping programs. While we continue to purposely reduce third-party advertising, the total MS&O growth rate was less due to easier comps from a year-ago. Turning to slide 9, our major cost drivers; in Q2 we delivered non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 33%. This represents a 6 point year-over-year decrease driven primarily by lower volume. Cost of revenue has increased in-line with Payments growth due to processing costs. While these variable costs will increase as Payments revenue grows, the incremental revenue provides leverage for our fixed expenses most notably Sales and Marketing and G&A.
Product Development costs increased year-over-year as we continue to invest in product innovation, supporting our strategic initiatives. Transaction losses were flat versus the prior year, as the benefits of matching seller fees against their net proceeds were offset by higher customer protection losses. Turning to EPS on slide 10, we delivered $0.99 of non-GAAP EPS in the second quarter, flat versus the prior year. Negative impacts from lapping COVID-driven volumes were offset by strategic initiatives, particularly Payments as well as a lower share count related to share repurchases. GAAP EPS for the quarter was $0.43, a decrease of 56% year-over-year.
We elected the fair value accounting method for our investments in Adevinta. The change in stock price between the close of the sale on June 24 and the quarter-end on June 30 drove a majority of the GAAP EPS decrease. In addition, while we recognized further gains on the Adevinta launch in Q2, we are lapping significant gains in the prior year. Moving to slide 11, we saw another strong quarter of cash generation with $910 million of free cash flow. This 7% year-over-year growth was driven by strong operational results led by Payments and improvements in working capital. This is partly offset by higher cash taxes.
Turning to slide 12, we ended the quarter with cash and investments of $7.6 billion and debt of $9.1 billion. As I mentioned in my earlier remarks, we completed the sale of the Classifieds business to Adevinta during quarter generating cash proceeds of $2.5 billion. We expect to pay cash taxes associated with the sale of approximately $400 million in the third quarter. As a result of our strong underlying free cash flow performance, and the proceeds from this transaction, we updated our capital allocation plans for 2021 by increasing the estimated share buyback to $5 billion.
In Q2, we returned $1.6 billion to our shareholders through stock repurchases and dividends. We repurchased approximately 24 million shares at an average price of $62.60 per share, amounting to $1.5 billion and paid a dividend of $121 million. We exited the quarter with $4.2 billion of share repurchase authorization remaining. Our board has approved an additional share repurchase authorization of $3 billion with no expiry raising the total to approximately $7.2 billion. Finally, we issued $2.5 billion of senior unsecured notes during the quarter, parts of which will be used to repay our 2022 debt maturities.
Moving to investments on slide 13; on June 24, we closed the Classifieds sale and recorded investments on our balance sheet of $10.8 billion to reflect the 540 million shares we received as consideration. The value of this stake stood at $10.4 billion at quarter-end, based on Adevinta's stock price. Between the announcements of the deal, last July and the close of the transaction this June, the value of our equity stake appreciated 61%. As a regulatory condition of the Classifieds sale, we agreed to reduce our ownership stake in Adevinta to 33% or less, over the 18 months following the close of the deal. We recently announced an agreement with Permira to sell approximately 135 million shares for more than $2.4 billion.
This will reduce our ownership stake to 33%. We expect this transaction to close in the fourth quarter. Turning to Adyen, the warrants we acquired in the second quarter of 2018 are valued at $1.1 billion at the end of the second quarter, an increase of over $500 million year-over-year. You'll find more information on the Adyen line in our 10-Q. We also want to highlight our stake in Kakao Bank. At the end of the second quarter, our investment was worth approximately $300 million. On August 6, they completed their IPO, which increased the value of our stake to over $900 million. Finally, on June 24, we announced plans to sell over 80% of our Korea business to Emart.
We will retain an interest of less than 20%. The implied value of our interest was approximately $800 million at the time of the announcement. We remain excited about all these investments, the optionality they provide and the significant value that each generate for our shareholders. Turning to guidance on slide 14; for Q3 we are projecting revenue between $2.42 billion and $2.47 billion, growing 6% to 8% on an organic FX-neutral basis and approximately 7% to 9% on a spot basis. We anticipate Payments and Advertising will continue to drive revenue to grow faster than volume leading to take rates expansion.
This revenue guidance implies GMV is down low-to-mid-teens on an FX-neutral basis versus last year, and up high-single-digits compared to 2019. On a spot basis, today's rates would indicate a 2-point benefit versus FX-neutral growth rates in Q3. This is 2 points lower than the 4 point benefit we saw in Q2 GMV. We are assuming that macro benefits including stimulus and mobility will be significantly less in Q3 than Q2. We also expect that our FX to improve the business will continue to enable modestly positive underlying growth. We expect non-GAAP EPS of $0.86 to $0.90 per share representing 4% to 9% growth.
Year-over-year, we plan to continue investing in products and technology to deliver better category experiences while improving marketing efficiencies. We are expecting GAAP EPS in the range of $0.64 to $0.68 per share in Q3. Looking at the full year, the macro environment remains dynamic and difficult to predict, and we're not providing full year guidance at this time. However, there are variables within our control that we are sharing this context. Given the accelerated pace of the Payments transition, we are raising our full year forecast for Payments revenue from $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion. Payments margin contribution continues to ramp toward our long-term target of 25%.
Total operating margin for the business is expected to land approximately 33%, which will be close to 150 basis points better than 2019. As I mentioned before, we expect to repurchase shares totaling $5 billion in 2021 at this time, which implies an additional $3.2 billion in the second half. In conclusion, during the quarter, we delivered strong short-term results, ahead of expectations, while transforming the company for the longer-term. We are excited about the path forward and the growth potential of eBay.
Innovation is leading to volume growth in our focused categories despite tougher comps from the year-ago. Our Payments and Advertising initiatives are driving better customer experience, resulting in incremental revenue and earnings growth. Our balanced approach to cost management allows us to reinvest in our customers, while delivering high margins, with low capital intensity. We continue to deliver strong free cash flow and return value to our shareholders through stock repurchases and dividends.
Our portfolio simplification has created over $20 billion of shareholder value allowing us to intensely focus on growing the core. As a purpose-driven company, we're enabling economic opportunity for all, while supporting our people, our communities and our planet. I would like to once more take this opportunity to thank our teams across eBay, for their tremendous work over the last quarter and for their support for our buyers and sellers in the eBay community.
We will now take your questions. Operator?
Questions and Answers:

[Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Tom Champion with Piper Sandler.
Tom Champion -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst
Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Jamie, I'm wondering if you could elaborate a little bit on your buyer strategy. It sounds like we should expect maybe that metric is under pressure the next couple quarters. But what sort of underlies the strategy around focus, around this 20% of the buyer base? And I guess relatedly, with the portfolio improvements and streamlining the business, does this enhance your ability to execute more rapidly going forward? And maybe just a last one for Steve. Would love to hear a little bit more about your thought process and what drove you to the business given it's a little bit different from your prior background? Thanks very much.
Jamie Iannone -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, so first on the buyer strategy. This is something that I laid out last July when we talked about the tech-led reimagination as being focused on turning buyers into lifelong enthusiasts on the platform and moving away from the tactics that we had in 2019 what was really just about the number of active buyers even low value buyers or one and done buyers. I've got the whole organization pivoted to focusing on those high-value buyers; buyers that are buying over $800, buying six times a year, or buyers who sell.
And so as you think about these buyers, they're so strong at eBay they are 20% of them make up 75% of GMV and the goal is how do we turn more buyers into these lifelong enthusiasts. I've met a lot of buyers. They wake up and get a cup of coffee and they turn to eBay and open the eBay app and our focus is really not on just the total number, but really focused on how are we driving these buyers to become enthusiasts. The metrics that we show on the board deck are trailing 12-month metrics so obviously lapping the buyers that we acquired in Q2.
But going forward our focus will really be on these long-term enthusiasts. So I'm excited to say that their GMV is growing, they are growing as a population and more and more you're going to see us doing things to drive that longevity because we know the things that move buyers up the cohort curves into long-term buyers. On your second question on the portfolio, absolutely. A huge part of the portfolio simplification is about being able to focus on the marketplace, and as Steve talked about, we generated $20 billion in value for shareholders starting with the StubHub transaction.
But I think more importantly now, it enables us to focus all of our attention on the Marketplace business. As I've talked about, we see a lot of growth opportunity in that business. The strategy that we have is working. We're in year one of a multiyear reimagination of eBay, but if you look at what we talked about a second ago with the 10%, about to reach 20% of categories, it's really working, customer satisfaction is at 90%, it's leading to very strong GMV, and we see the same potential for this innovation playbook in every category in the site. And, Steve, maybe you want to take the last one?
Steve Priest -- Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer
Yeah, thank you, Jamie, and thank you, Tom, for your question. It's good to meet you this afternoon. I suppose I'd bifurcate between two areas. I've come from two companies, which were leaders in an industry around customer centricity and innovation, and coming over to eBay, a company that's got real sense of purpose, an amazing team and a heart around customer centricity and innovation were some of the core things facets I looked out when I came over to eBay.
Since I've been here, it's really clear about the sheer size and scale of the enterprise, and what opportunities are ahead of us in terms of its growth. We really do have incredible durability of a financial model with a fortress balance sheet, best-in-class margins, incredible free cash flow and even after a few weeks, I sort of feel that the value of the enterprise is really misunderstood because of the potential that's ahead of us and especially that Jamie's laid out so I'm really excited to be here, huge opportunities for the enterprise and I'm looking forward to my journey over here at eBay.
Tom Champion -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst
Thank you both.
Operator
Your next question is from Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse.
Stephen Ju -- Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC -- Analyst
Okay. Thank you so much. So, Jamie, I know this question goes back a way in terms of what we could be doing once the Managed Payments is fully deployed but now we're pretty much at the goal line here so there has to be pockets of the global demand base, you otherwise could not cater to before, because you just simply could not take their money, so what are the prospects of opening up the buyer acquisition funnel to that audience a bit more, in those regions. And I guess on a second point, recently you launched a performance service in the UK with a partner, so can you talk about what kind of improvement you think you may see to either conversion rates and buyer experience as you step-up the level of service for the buyers in the country. Thanks.
Jamie Iannone -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, thanks for the question. On the first one we're excited that as we get through Managed Payments, we announced next quarter we'll be at 90%. That opens up even more opportunities for us from a how do we service our buyers and sellers. So some examples of things that we've already launched for example, is we launched a partnership with Afterpay as an additional form of Payment in Australia allowing people to in their market to pay with installments. It's very strong in Australia, and that's certainly helped us in Australia business.
In our UK business, we've launched a partnership that allows us to do stellar financing and help sellers out there, and we'll continue to expand in different ways to help the globe on more opportunities around managed Payments. The other big one that I talked about earlier is that now that commerce and Payments are one, and we can manage all of that on eBay, there's a lot of friction we can take out of the platform, so unpaid items is a great example where for 25 years since I was here the first time, sellers have had to face items where buyers wouldn't pay.
We've now eliminated that in the 99% of options on our way to do that in best price, I'm sorry best offer, we eliminated fixed-price on the way to do it in best offer and options and two weeks ago we had eBay Open with thousands of sellers online and we announced this and it was massive rejoicing from them because this has been a key pain point. So the other thing I'm excited about is just eliminating those pain points.
On your question on the fulfillment service what we saw in the U.S. and especially in our cross-border trade coming out of Greater China, for example, is the ability to forward deploy inventory as a benefit because of the predictability that it gives to buyers from that standpoint, so we're using it to help scale Small Businesses, to drive the ability to have forward deployment and basically pass those savings on to the customer, so we're just getting started with that program, but we've learned a lot about cross-border trade and we're excited that fulfillment service is going to help scale some of our Small Businesses in their cross-border inventory.

Your next question is from Michael McGovern with Bank of America.
Michael McGovern -- Bank of America Securities -- Analyst
Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Two if I may. The first, just on Promoted Listings. It looked like they were sort of the Promoted Listings revenue is unchanged quarter-on-quarter so there's a bit of a deceleration and I was just wondering if there's anything to call out specifically for that in Q2? And then secondly, looking at the decline in sold items. It looks like the sold items was down by more than GMV was down and looking back to last year GMV grew more than sold items last year, so it doesn't look to be driven by comps. So is there anything to call out for the decline in sold items for Q2 as well? Thank you.
Jamie Iannone -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, so on the first one on Promoted Listings, no that business is doing well, so we grew at 8% in the quarter, despite volume being down 11%, and we actually are starting to scale up a couple of palettes that we launched in Q2 specifically, ads for options what we're calling Promoted Listings Express which is a CPC business and then -- and off eBay advertising business so we continue to see lots of potential in that business, and these three areas are just getting started. On the sold items, that's really a reflection of the purposeful decisions that we've made to one, is move away from low value items that weren't driving the type of return and low value buyers specifically.
As well as a shift to higher ASP in general, because of the strategy, the focused category strategy working. So we talked about the strength that we're seeing in trading cards and collectibles already having done $2 billion this year. The same is all of last year, really driving our C2C business and C2C tends to have higher ASP or higher average selling price than our B2C business and so that's also driving that dynamic. So it's actually in-line with where we want it to be. We think it's healthy for the ecosystem, and we think it's going to continue to be driven that way because C2C, as we look at it, we hope to continue to outpace B2C and lean in on these categories of value like our luxury goods collectibles, etc.

Your next question is from Colin Sebastian with Baird.
Colin Sebastian -- Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. -- Analyst
Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. Welcome, Steve. I guess, Jamie, first just wanted to follow up on the buyer strategy. I'm just trying to figure out how we should think about that ultimately translating into Marketplace growth? And is there going to be, for example, an extended period of decay in those less active users before the Marketplace essentially normalizes and then you could show growth? And then secondly, I guess more housekeeping. In terms of what was behind the acceleration and the move to Managed Payment in Q2? It seems like maybe about a quarter or two ahead of plan there if I have the metrics right? Thank you.
Jamie Iannone -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, so on your first question, on the buyer strategy, yeah, we're purposely moving away from low value buyers or kind of low CLTV and low GMV for buyers. If you remember back to 2019 we talked about that strategy and because some of these are trailing 12-month metrics some of those numbers are actually still in our numbers even from 2019. But the reason I'm focused on is if you look at those 50% of buyers they only contribute 5% of GMV and the top 20% contribute 75%.
And so by focusing the organization, not on just how many buyers do we have on the platform but how many of our buyers are we turning into these high-value buyers, we think that's much healthier for the growth of the platform in the long-term much healthier for sellers, etc, drives better with the marketing strategy that we're going after, we're really focused on the first 90-days of the customer and getting them up their lifecycle, so this is going to be a purposeful strategy you're going to see us on for years, walking away from the work that we did back in 2019.
When you ask about the managed Payments, what I'm really happy about is the execution from the team. If you look at when we started, for example, enabling Greater China we got to 90% penetration within 10 weeks, and so we took the learning from what started two years ago with the U.S. and Germany and we've learned a lot as we rolled out all of the other countries and that pace speaks to the pace of execution of the team and what they're doing and I know there are a lot of questions of would we be able to even reach the targets we had for next year originally and I'm just excited that we're ahead of schedule, and we're starting to do things like the Afterpay and the seller financing because there's just a lot of potential for this business as we fully manage the Payments all through eBay.

Hey, guys. Thanks for taking our questions today. I guess first, you guys have made a big push into authentication as part of your focus on some of these vertical enthusiast communities and I know we believe a lot of this is done on an outsourced basis. I guess at some point, do you need to bring this in-house and kind of how scalable are your current authentication solutions? And then kind of broadly speaking, it seems like you guys have been fairly innovative with adding more functionality to eBay stores. What is the uptick been of the subscription product and kind of what is the product roadmap look like from here? Thanks.
Jamie Iannone -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, so first on your question on authentication. Look, we're really excited at how we've been able to scale this program. We've now authenticated 1 million items on the platform. We've expanded that authentication for sneakers to UK, Australia and Canada. This quarter we announced that we're authenticating handbags over $500 in the U.S. And we're using a mixture of third-party and in-house resources to do so, but what we're seeing is that this authentication has a great ROI. What it's able to do in terms of driving GMV, driving new buyers into the site?
I'll just give you, I'll reiterate the stat we talked about last quarter in sneakers which is acquiring a Gen Z, they buy $500 in sneakers, but they buy $2,000 in other categories on the site. We're seeing same thing in watches where a luxury watch buyer is buying $8,000 in categories outside of watches and that's over 50 items, and that's one of the benefits of eBay is that cross-category shopping nature, and that's really hard for other competitors to replicate. On eBay stores, we talked about being the seller platform of choice and a big part of that is our strategy of really growing eBay stores. So this quarter, we announced a new program where it's much simpler to set up your eBay store.
And I'm really excited by one of the features the team announced, which was the ability for a seller to send coupons to repeat buyers, so this is something that sellers have been asking for. We built it in as part of the store's platform, and in just a few short months since its launch, that product already has 1 million buyers taking advantage of those coupons from sellers. So another thing that as we had our big eBay Open Event two weeks ago, our sellers were really excited by and frankly we're just getting started on that program. So we're even continuing to make sellers aware of these new capabilities. So you'll continue to see quarter-after-quarter and year-after-year innovation on eBay stores because it's an important part of our strategy.

Your next question is from Ross Sandler with Barclays.
Ross Sandler -- Barclays Capital, Inc. -- Analyst
Hey, guys. Two questions on the model here. You've got about a 10 point easier comp for GMV on a ex-FX basis in the third quarter and you're calling for a little bit more decel from here. Should we chalk that uptick on purging some of the low quality buyers and a chunk of that 25% of GMV that they represent, or is that just a macro kind of dropping off? Any color on that would be great. And then your 33% operating margin for 2021. That's got the brunt of all the Payment ramp in there, so as we kind of look ahead to 2022 and we expect GMV to start growing again, how should we think about that operating margin? What are the puts and takes on that going up or going down next year? Thanks a lot.
Steve Priest -- Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer
Hi, Ross. Steve here, I'll pick those up. So I'll start off with second quarter and as we laid everything out on an apples-to-apples basis we've obviously exceeded our expectations across all the major metrics. We laid out our third quarter guidance and obviously, that reflects the best view based on what we're seeing in our most recent trends in the first part of the quarter and our latest outlook on mobility. This is actually an unchanged view versus what the we communicated when we guided the second quarter.
And what we indicated was that we expected the second half GMV growth will be similar to Q2, as the easier comps will be offset by lower macro benefits in 2021, as mobility dropped backed to normal. And we are seeing some of that in the two -- in particular couple of our key markets in the likes of Germany and the UK, so that underpins that. And again, we sort of when we look through that lens, we expect that to lead to a low-to-mid-teen volume decline year-over-year, which actually, at the heart of it, indicates modestly positive growth from the underlying business on the basis of us continuing to improve the customer experience and execute on the vision that Jamie has laid out.
Specifically with regards to your second question about the 33% operating margin for 2021. Obviously, we're ramping Payments up. We talked extensively about the fact that that's actually a lower-margin positive business, so the 25%. We've guided our expectations that 2021 will end with that 33%. With our recapped financials, that was 150 basis stronger than 2019, so we're right on track. We're seeing margin accretion from all of the initiatives that we're driving forward. We're not guiding 2022 at this point, but I'm very pleased with the trajectory that we're sitting on.

Your next question is from Richard Kramer with Arete Research.
Richard Kramer -- Arete Research -- Analyst
Thanks very much. Jamie, first of all, you spoke about being a platform of choice for sellers, but you've also hit a record transaction take rate of 11.3% and suggesting that a rise year-on-year. What's your message to sellers with the notion that what they're seeing in terms of their cost on eBay continuing to go up as there's been a lot of issues and glitches with working out final value fees and tax and so forth?
And then a couple quick questions for Steve. Can you give us a bit more detail on the decline in gross margins? You mentioned Payments and authentication and also, adjusting for the fair value of both warrants and equity and the investments, it looks like free cash flow would have been about a third lower. So can you talk about what you're seeing in the underlying free cash flow of the business when we remove all these very noisy investment income and changes in fair value of warrants? Thanks.
Jamie Iannone -- President and Chief Executive Officer
On your first question, I think what is important there is to think about the fact that there used to be a separate take rate associated with Payments, and now what our sellers are seeing is a blended take rate. And in general, the vast majority of sellers will actually be paying lower fees when you look at the combined take rate that they pay, because they are no longer paying that separate piece, and its one single rate. The reason you're still seeing a rise intake rate and may continue to do so is just because of the ramp of Payments so as Payments ramps up, that starts to get reflected in eBay's take rate, but the sellers no longer paying that PayPal or other form of Payment take rate.
The second key thing for us is making sure that we return the value to the sellers for the fees that we're charging. And so when you think about the scale demand we can bring in terms of 159 million buyers, in terms of new capabilities that we'll bring to them on the platform like the ability to go back to repeat sellers, there are areas where we've discounted our fees like in sneakers, which has worked out really well in terms of growing those categories. We look in general at the value that we provide and I would say in our core business, we actually feel really good about that. And what we're seeing in our advertising business is that the ROAS or return on ad spend that our sellers are seeing is actually higher than what they're getting on other platforms, which also, I think, speaks to the value of the demand that we're providing. I'll let Steve take the other questions.
Steve Priest -- Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer
Hi Richard. Good to meet you remotely. I'll cover off the first question with regard to margin so I think about the three key areas, the underlying business, there's Payments and then there's the likes of authentication. And so as a reminder we laid out the strategy around Payments a couple of years ago, with regards to $2 billion of incremental revenue, $500 million of incremental Op margin and as Jamie alluded to, that is going very well, the momentum is going well. We've increased the forecast to 2021 to $1.8 billion on the revenue side. And as I said earlier, we are continuing to be on the path to the incremental 150 basis points over two-years on our margin story.
So it's not necessarily driving any dilution in the margin story. It's greater from a net income standpoint as we go forward. The second point on authentication. Jamie mentioned the return on investment I was providing. It's rather de minimis when you look at the overall cost structure in terms of, in fact, less than half a point of margin, is where you go from authentication, but the amount of stickiness that is providing for our customers when against cost category buying more than pays for itself and it's an investment we're really glad we're making as we think about the whole ecosystem and then the ability for that to move across categories.
With regards to our free cash flow, at an underlying level we generated free cash flow of $910 million in the quarter. The warrants are not achieved yet and the free cash flow investments. What I would say is that we continue to invest in product as part of our core platform, A, in terms of the Payments rollout, which is going extremely well. Another product, the investments with regards to moving the sites forward in the categories that Jamie alluded to earlier. So, we're doing very well in terms of the organization and how we're moving forward, and very happy to follow offline if there's any further questions.

Your next question is from Deepak Mathivanan with Wolfe Research.
Deepak Mathivanan -- Wolfe Research, LLC -- Analyst
Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. To start off, just to follow up on Ross' question. The low-to-mid-teens GMV decline in 3Q, anyway you can sort of give us color on the mobility assumptions behind that? Should we expect incremental deceleration in 4Q or is 3Q sort of a reflection of all potential reversals due to mobility? You're right that it's hard to forecast COVID dynamics but want to understand your guidance assumptions. And then second one you monetized some of your Adevinta stake. How should we think about the approach with the rest? Is there any specific cadence or timeline that you have in mind? Thank you.
Steve Priest -- Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer
Good afternoon, Deepak. So I'll address the first question as you laid out in terms of mobility. We have, as I said in my prepared comments assumed that we start ramp off the significant lockdowns coming from 2020 through 2021. We talked about the fact that mobility in terms of people getting out and about would increase as we went through the second quarter and so as we get into the third then that's rolling off. In fact, if you look at particularly Germany, one of our biggest markets in the UK, things are pretty much back to normal from a mobility standpoint. Travel is going through the roof if you look at search in terms of leisure activities and travel picked up fast as we're going forward.
Obviously, it feels a little different maybe over here at the moment with regard to the Delta variant, but in essence, we're seeing things we're expecting in that going forward. I'm not going to get beyond quarter two, Deepak in all seriousness because we chose not to guide further than that because of the uncertainty but we are assuming in the third quarter that things are sort of starting to get back to some sort of normality it and we're not in a sort of lockdown scenario. With regards to the Adevinta transaction, obviously, that was completed.
When we think about Adyen in Korea, we have agreed those transactions are not closed yet and obviously, therefore, we're not getting into discussions about the proceeds associated with those transactions until those are closed. So obviously, leading into the Adevinta, very pleased that we're able to increase the share buyback from $2 billion to $5 billion this year-in terms of driving those returns for shareholders, but it's too early to say with regard to the other transactions that are not closed yet.

Your final question is from Dan Salmon with BMO Capital Markets.
Daniel Salmon -- BMO Capital Markets -- Analyst
Hey. Good afternoon, everyone. Jamie, could you come back and review the rollout Promoted Listings express and CPC pricing? What are your key goals there? Is it to grow the advertiser base, deeper spend for advertiser and bring more of your sellers more deeply to the program? Any more color on that would be great and maybe an appropriate last comment for the call. You've mentioned the eBay Open seller forum a couple times here and some of the pieces of feedback that you got. What would you say were the two to three most important that you heard from the sellers?
Jamie Iannone -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, so first on the Promoted Listings the rollout CPC is really to have additional ad formats, additional capabilities for sellers to drive visibility of their listings, so we talked last quarter about how we're only at 1% of GMV, and if you look at other platforms, we think they're significant potential in the kind of low-to-mid single-digit percentage of GMV. The backs of the existing program where we've already done over $1 billion, grew 8% this quarter, we're really on a single type of advertising, in a single format, so it was all CPA on fixed-price.
So as we expand now to options, as we expand to a CPC where we introduce more bidding capabilities for our top spot and search that just enables sellers to have more tools. So we're in beta on that product right now, and I would just say in general we're really excited about what we're seeing because our ROAS is really strong meaning our buyer experience is performing well and the return of the sellers are getting on that spend is productive and much more productive than they would get on other platforms. In terms of eBay Open, I think we had a lot of really positive feedback about the unpaid item noise.
I've known sellers forever get frustrated when that happens to them, especially for a new seller, and so they're really excited that we're tackling that as part of Managed Payments. I'd say they're really excited about what we're doing in stores and coupons because they want to build their brand on eBay, they want to drive repeat business and so I think they're really excited by that. I'd say the other form that was really well-attended and had a lot of excitement was the trading cards forum. The launch of computer-vision where we're driving 80% of the scans are really identifying what the product is and it's simplifying the listing flow.
We launched this new My Collections which is a really popular feature for people because they can show off their collections and we launched a price guide feature, which eBay has this treasure trove of data in the 25 years of history. Nobody has the data that we have it's a really great asset for us, so I'd say that area and those sellers that join in particular were really excited by the innovation that we're making. I love those forums because this platform gets better by listening to our sellers and hearing their feedback and they give us lots of ideas of things to continue to work on in the tech-led reimagination so a great interaction. Despite being virtual, they all can't wait to be in person again like we can but it was a really good session.

Joby Aviation (NYSE:JOBY) is officially public today after closing its business combination with Reinvent Technology. Today marks the public start of Joby’s big growth trajectory, but the company has been leading innovation in the vertical takeoff, air taxi space for quite some time now…
Source: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com
With all revolutionary companies, it’s the investors who look beyond the scope of the present time — who see glimpses of the future, today — who reap the most bountiful rewards.
Back in the day, those who saw the incredible potential that computers held for society have since profited immensely off of early investments in companies like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).
The same can be said of those who invested in e-commerce, back when it was clunky and far from streamlined. Stocks like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) panned out quite nicely for those forward-thinking folks.
Don’t Kick Yourself Later…
Now, it’s quite obvious that investing in revolutionary companies will net you huge gains.
But companies pushing the envelope of society via revolutionary technology carry significantly more investment risks, obviously.
And this means many people will end up overlooking companies poised for massive long-term growth in favor of stocks with big, but not huge upside. Until it’s too late, at which point they kick themselves for not following their intuition.
You see, people often bandwagon into companies like Microsoft, Apple, Amazon and eBay after the earliest investors have already made unbelievable gains. These people will make money, that’s for certain, but not as much as they could have made.
Now, with Joby Aviation, you’ve got a shot to get in early with this soon-to-be airborne company.
2024 isn’t that far off, especially when you realize what Joby brings to the table.
In 2024, Joby expects to shorten hour-long car rides into five-minute eVTOL (electric vertical takeoff and landing) trips — for the same price as an Uber ride covering the same distance.
These eVTOL aircrafts are essentially electric, quiet helicopters that are far more easy and inexpensive to manufacture, which is why Joby rides will be achievable at such an affordable price point.
The company is essentially creating the flying cars everyone has been waiting so long for.
Joby Aviation’s Origins
Joby Aviation has been doing what it does for a long time.
Way back in 2009, Joby Aviation was formed with the express purpose of creating an aerial ridesharing company utilizing eVTOL aircraft.
Joby Aviation has not only been in the eVTOL space the longest, they also have acquired an incredible backing, which will undoubtedly grow in the future. Some of the biggest VC firms in Silicon Valley are betting on Joby Aviation to bring affordable and efficient, eVTOL-based air travel to the masses.
Even NASA is impressed by Joby. Back in 2012, NASA collaborated with Joby on multiple groundbreaking electric flight projects such as the X-57 and LEAPTech.
Thanks to additional expertise gained from this collaboration, no doubt, Joby put out its first prototype in 2017 — four years ago.
Fast forward to today, and Joby Aviation’s eVTOL aircraft has progressed from prototype to the best-in-class eVTOL with a top speed of 200mph, 150-mile range and super quiet 65 dBA noise level. With those specifications, Joby Aviation’s eVTOL even received airworthiness approval from the U.S. Air Force and G-1 certification from the Federal Aviation Administration.
Toyota Motors (NYSE:TM) has poured loads of money into the company and also lent Joby Aviation engineering support to fine-tune aircraft development processes.
Uber (NYSE:UBER) has even gone so far as to form a partnership with Joby Aviation to incorporate it into the Uber app once it commences its commercial operations.
The Bottom Line on JOBY Stock
Joby Aviation presents investors with a unique investment opportunity.
For one, this is a top-notch company that will bring a revolutionary technology and service to society.
But, at the same time, it’s also lightyears ahead of any competition, meaning there’s not really any picking and choosing between companies to do here.
If you believe eVTOL technology will be a global ubiquity someday — and it’s hard to imagine a world where this technology doesn’t take off — then there’s no better company to invest in than Joby Aviation.
And that’s why we recommend buying JOBY stock. It’s the next Microsoft, Apple or Amazon.

The U.S. stock futures are trading lower in pre-market trading after another record-setting day for Wall Street. This week is another week packed with corporate earnings to watch alongside the inflation data set to be announced today. The S&P 500 and Dow are also near their all-time highs on the back of the U.S. Senate passage of a major infrastructure bill.
“Realistically, what an infrastructure bill is going to mean is additional spending into the economy. Just like the stimulus has helped the economy for the last year, that’s more money that can be going into the economy and helping businesses get through the slump they have been in previously … Generally speaking, the economy looks to be on good footing, and this is only going to be an added benefit on top of that.” –Courtney Dominguez, Senior Wealth Advisor for Payne Capital Management
Despite the COVID-19 case numbers rising in the U.S. and around the world, the stock market continues to power higher as of late. It may be due to the widespread vaccination that has helped limit the delta variant’s impact. Or it may be partly to do with the infrastructure bill. And these developments continue to present opportunities in thestock market today Dow futures are trading in the positive territory, moving 0.09% higher as of 6:44 a.m. ET. Meanwhile, S&P and Nasdaq futures are declining by 0.06% and 0.20% respectively.

4 Top Semiconductor Stocks To Watch This Week
Best Lithium Battery Stocks To Buy Now? 4 To Know
Nio Earnings Are In The Spotlight Today
Chinese electric vehicle maker Nio (NYSE: NIO) is set to report earnings today after the market closes. Investors may not have been excited by Nio’s muted price action lately. While the struggles afflict EV stocks across the board, could NIO stock be any different when it reports earnings today? Before we dive deeper, it is also meaningful to see what the analysts are expecting for the second quarter. 
According to Thomson Reuters, analysts’ consensus points to a loss of $0.11 per Nio ADR on revenue of $1.28 billion. However, Edison Yu of Deutsche Bank, who has covered Nio stock closely, thinks it could do better. Specifically, Yu and his team expect Nio to report a loss of about $0.07 on revenue of $1.32 billion.
It will be important to look at how Nio progresses toward its goal of having 4,000 battery swapping stations worldwide by 2025. And as the Chinese government has announced national battery swap safety standards, the company’s efforts to increase its battery-station footprint is music to investors’ ears. Investors will also be watching Nio’s guidance for the rest of 2021 closely. And that guidance may arguably have a stronger impact on NIO stock. Nio’s report could also sway investors’ expectations on fellow Chinese EV players Li Auto (NASDAQ: LI) and Xpeng (NYSE: XPEV), which have yet to report their results.

FuboTV (NYSE: FUBO), the leading sports-first live TV streaming platform, reported stellar financial performance for its second quarter ended June 30, 2021.

Last month, the company also announced a market access agreement with The Cordish Companies for its forthcoming mobile Fubo Sportsbook in Pennsylvania. The Cordish Companies is the owner and operator of the Live! Casino franchise and Fubo, through Fubo Gaming, will provide state-wide mobile access for both sports betting and iGaming.
“Our second-quarter results showcase the continued momentum in our business, with consumers choosing fuboTV over more expensive legacy pay TV services due to our innovative product experience and customer-friendly approach at an affordable price.“- Edgar Bronfman Jr. Executive Chairman of fuboTV

Upstart Stock Surges After Strong Guidance & Solid Earnings Beat
Upstart (NASDAQ: UPST), which uses artificial intelligence (AI) to evaluate the creditworthiness of loan applicants, reported a blowout second quarter yesterday. Total revenue came in 1,018% higher from the second quarter of 2020. Meanwhile, transaction volume came in at 286,864, totaling $2.8 billion across its platform in the second quarter. This represents a 1,605% increase from the same quarter of the prior year.
“Our second-quarter results continue to show why Upstart has the potential to be among the world’s largest and most impactful FinTechs,” said Dave Girouard, CEO of Upstart. “Lending is the center beam of revenue and profits in financial services and artificial intelligence may be the most transformational change to come to this industry in its 5,000-year history.“
Recall that Upstart expanded into car loans earlier this year. With U.S. consumers owing over $1.3 trillion on their vehicles, Upstart has quite a growth opportunity ahead of it. Given that the company has achieved profitability, and scored an impressive quarterly performance. It seems to me that Upstart is just getting started. Perhaps, the business could continue to achieve strong performance in the long run. Investors should keep an eye on revenue growth in the coming quarters. Should the company continue to deliver at this pace, UPST stock could potentially be a good deal at its current valuation.

2021-08-10 00:00:00+00:00,"Amazon, Etsy: E-Commerce Stocks Look Attractive Following Post Earnings Sell-Off",EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/amazon-etsy%3A-e-commerce-stocks-look-attractive-following-post-earnings-sell-off-2021-08-10,,,"Our theme of E-Commerce Stocks – which is comprised of U.S.-based e-commerce companies as well as logistics, and payment players, has declined by about 7% over the last month, compared to the S&P 500 which rose 1.5% over the same period. While second-quarter earnings turned out stronger than expected for most e-commerce companies that have reported results, mixed Q3 guidance and expectations of slowing growth post the Covid-19 lockdowns appear to have hurt sentiment for the fast-growing sector. For instance, e-commerce bellwether Amazon saw revenue growth slow to 27% year-over-year in Q2 201, down from about 44% in Q1, while noting that growth could slow further in Q3 to about 13.5%, based on the mid-point of guidance.
That being said, we think the recent decline presents an opportunity to enter the sector. Covid-19 cases in the U.S. are on the rise once again, driven by the spread of the highly infectious Delta variant of the virus. The seven-day average infection rate in the U.S. has risen from 22,000 in early July to over 100,000 cases presently. This could delay the re-opening of workplaces and keep people at home for a few more quarters, helping e-commerce stocks in the near term. Moreover, while there was already a secular shift to online shopping prior to Covid-19, the pandemic is likely to accelerate this trend, given the changes in consumer behavior through months of lockdowns, helping these stocks in the longer run.
[7/8/2021] Why E-Commerce Stocks Are Still A Buy
Our theme of E-Commerce Stocks – which is comprised of U.S.-based e-commerce companies as well as logistics, and payment players – is up by 25% year-to-date, outperforming the broader Nasdaq-100 which is up by about 17% over the same period. The gains come despite the fact that the brick and mortar retail is opening up following Covid-19, with over half of U.S. adults now vaccinated and Covid cases on the decline. Now, e-commerce was gaining share from physical retail prior to Covid, and investors are likely betting that the pandemic is only likely to bolster the shift to online shopping, given the changes in consumer behavior through months of lockdowns. For example, research firm eMarketer estimates that U.S. retail e-commerce sales will grow by 13.7% this year and by 15% next year, with consumers expected to spend over $1 trillion via digital retail channels in 2022.
Within our theme, eBay (EBAY) stock has been the strongest performer, rising by about 39% year-to-date, driven by stronger demand growth and also due to its lower valuation multiples which have helped it capitalize on the broader rotation from high-growth to value stocks over the last few months. On the other side, Etsy (ETSY) a platform focused on handmade products, vintage items, and craft supplies, has been the worst performer within our theme, with its stock gaining just about 8%, amid weaker earnings guidance, as it faces a tough comparison with a solid pandemic year.
[4/6/2021] Will The Third Stimulus Check Help E-Commerce Stocks?
Our theme of E-Commerce Stocks – which includes U.S-based e-commerce platform players as well as logistics, and digital payment companies – is up by about 14% year-to-date, compared to the S&P 500 which is up by about 9% over the same period. The theme is also up by a solid 151% since the end of 2019, compared to a 26% return on the S&P 500. While investors have been rotating out of software and other high-growth stocks as the economy continues to open up following Covid-19, most e-commerce names in our theme have held up as investors likely expect e-commerce to continue eating into retail sales even post the pandemic. Moreover, it’s likely that a sizeable amount of the stimulus checks being mailed out as part of the $1.9 trillion Covid-19 rescue package will flow toward digital commerce spending, helping these companies. Within our theme, Wayfair (NYSE:W) a company that sells furniture and home goods online, has been the strongest performer with its stock up by about 43% year-to-date. On the other side, e-commerce bellwether Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has underperformed with its stock remaining roughly flat year-to-date.
[3/18/2021] E-Commerce Stocks To Watch
Our theme of E-Commerce Stocks includes U.S-based e-commerce platform players, logistics, and digital payment companies that stand to gain as shopping continues to move online. The e-commerce market has expanded significantly over the last year as the Covid-19 pandemic accelerated the shift away from brick and mortar stores to digital shopping, not just for discretionary items but also necessities. For perspective,  e-commerce as a percentage of overall U.S. retail sales jumped from around 16% in 2019 to almost 21% in 2020. [1] There’s a lot more room for the market to grow, considering that the total U.S. retail market stood at about $4 trillion in 2020. Our theme has outperformed the broader markets significantly, returning about 151% since the end of 2019, versus about 23% for the S&P 500. The theme is also up 11% year-to-date, compared to about 6% for the S&P 500. Below is a bit more about some of the companies in our theme and how they have fared.
Etsy (ETSY) an e-commerce platform that focuses on handmade products, vintage items, and craft supplies had a solid run through the pandemic, as gross merchandise sales, active buyers, and sellers on its platform soared. We think the company should continue to do well post the pandemic, as it could become the go-to platform for unique items that may not be available locally. The stock is up by about 388% since the end of 2019.
Wayfair (W), an e-commerce company that sells furniture and home goods, benefited from the trends of sheltering at home – which raised the demand for home improvement and the growing shift to e-commerce. The company is also building a very loyal base of customers, with more than two-thirds of its orders over its last quarter coming from repeat customers. The stock has gained a solid 248% since the end of 2019.
Carvana (CVNA) is an online used car retailer. Demand for used cars soared through Covid-19, as people look to avoid public transport. Moreover, customers shifted to e-commerce for buying cars as they remained averse to traditional in-person buys. The stock is up by about 208% since the end of 2019.
PayPal Holdings (PYPL) operates a worldwide online payments system that supports online money transfers. The stock has gained about 130% since the end of 2019, as people have preferred digital payment mediums through Covid pandemic. Moreover, the company’s move to allow users to buy, sell, and hold select Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin on its app has also helped its stock.
FedEx (FDX) stock is up by about 72% since the end of 2019. Although the company has seen some headwinds in recent years, as major customer Amazon doubled down on investments into its own logistics operations, the Covid-19 pandemic caused e-commerce shipments by the company to pick up. E-commerce should remain a tailwind, with the company expecting e-commerce package deliveries to more than triple to 111 million per day by 2026, up from about 35 million in 2019.
Amazon (AMZN), the e-commerce pioneer, saw demand for both its cloud computing business – Amazon Web Services – and its core online retail business soar through the pandemic, with revenue jumping by a solid 38% last year to about $386 billion. Amazon stock is up by about 67% since the end of 2019.

2021-08-10 00:00:00+00:00,Why eBay Wins From Supply Chain Woes,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-ebay-wins-from-supply-chain-woes-2021-08-10,,,"Supply chain disruptions have been an ongoing issue since the onset of the pandemic. Economic lockdowns and stay-at-home orders initiated to help slow the spread of the coronavirus also slowed production.
Even though essential industries were allowed to stay open during the pandemic, operations were often disrupted by a COVID-19 outbreak. Moreover, many consumers have concentrated their spending on manufactured goods over the past 18 months since they didn't have alternative spending options (like concerts, sporting events, and theme parks) to spend disposable income on. The combination of supply disruptions and surging demand has strained the system, and there are no signs of the situation easing anytime soon.
One way to play this situation as an investor is to look at eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY). Surprisingly, the company could actually benefit from the supply chain issues. Let's take a closer look at how.
Image source: Getty Images.
Never sold out
eBay does not handle fulfillment and leaves the logistics of product delivery up to the buyer and seller. It merely acts as a platform for bringing the two together and collecting a fee for its service. In its most recent quarter, this sales model helped eBay earned revenue of $3 billion on gross merchandise volume of $27.5 billion.
Under normal circumstances, not handling fulfillment has been a slight disadvantage for eBay. Customers have gotten used to fast and free shipping and knowing what day the order will arrive from some eBay competitors that handle their own product fulfillment. But eBay's disadvantage here goes away when supply disruptions occur, since several retailers are experiencing delayed shipments and extended order-to-delivery dates.
Having an asset-lite business model without fulfillment facilities also allows eBay to earn higher profit margins. Indeed, over the last 10 years, eBay has earned an operating profit margin of 23.9%. Over the same time frame, Amazon has earned an operating profit margin of 2.2%. Spending more to manage the supply chain disruptions eats into that margin even further.
Finally, eBay is also benefitting from supply shortages at retailers. When the desired product gets sold out at major retailers, the resale market on eBay ramps up as buyers and sellers of those products connect and the product price (and eBay's cut) rises because of demand. Just one example of this was the demand for the Sony PlayStation 5 gaming console at Christmastime. Supply chain woes meant it was sold out for much of the season at Target and Walmart, but you could find several people selling the item at a premium price on eBay.
What this could mean for investors
The delta variant is extending the supply chain havoc caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Thankfully, over 4 billion doses of vaccine against COVID-19 have been administered worldwide. Still, the end of the pandemic is nowhere in sight. As long as there is a deadly virus in circulation, it looks like there will be supply disruptions. All it takes is one outbreak at a port to send home dozens of workers and prevent supplies from getting where they need to be.
The longer this disruption lasts, the more favorable eBay becomes in the eyes of consumers. That should help keep revenue elevated and help the company add new customers -- some of which will stick around in the aftermath. Looking out longer-term, the company will benefit as more shopping moves online in the wake of this change in how consumers access the things they need.
eBay stock is currently trading at a favorable price-to-earnings ratio of 16.36. Investors looking for a company that can do well through supply chain disruptions and the aftermath of the pandemic can feel good about adding eBay stock to their portfolio.

2021-08-09 00:00:00+00:00,3 Stocks to Buy for the Second Half of 2021,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-stocks-to-buy-for-the-second-half-of-2021-2021-08-09,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
The equity markets are incredibly resilient in 2021. This is in spite of many challenges, most recently fears of new versions of the novel coronavirus virus. The super rally started last year from the depth of the pandemic lows. The effort to reflate the economy may have been too big. And it is possible that the government’s stimuli programs went too far. As a result, equities remain strong providing a constant flow of stocks to buy on dips.
Just when fear and uncertainty start to manifest among traders, they quickly vanish. Last week, the CBOE volatility index (VIX) hit a five-week low. With so many questions lingering, I find this behavior somewhat reckless on Wall Street. Inside the assumption that this incredible wave of bullishness persists, today we discuss three stocks to buy. The idea is to catch midterm swings for short-term profits. Long-term investors can participate but that would depend on their time frames and patience.
I picked three completely different investment profiles on purpose. Therefore, they are not mutually exclusive and can belong in a portfolio concurrently. However, I do caution against taking too many directional trades when markets are at the all-time highs. After a rally this long, the odds of a correction increases.
The major indices are still breaking records, and the only laggard is a small-cap sector. The reaction this week to AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) stock could influence the bunch. Although each company is not big enough to do that, the collective is.
Successful investing means considering all aspects of the market. We have too many questions to be comfortable in our conviction. I rely heavily on technical analysis to guide me during uncertain stints. Fundamentals are important, but why not data information from the charts to increase our odds for success?
7 Materials Stocks Ready to Supply the Infrastructure Boom
Swing trades by definition need proper timing. Ignoring the technical tools in this day and age is a mistake. I would never willingly give up an edge to my competitor. Yes, it is a competition because for every buyer there is a seller on the other end. Each party believes that the other is making a mistake. Time will be the ultimate judge on that.
The three stocks to buy today are:
Ebay (NASDAQ:EBAY)
Novavax (NASDAQ:NVAX)
SPDR S&P Biotech ETF (NYSEARCA:XBI)
Stocks to Buy: Ebay (EBAY)
Source: Charts by TradingView
eBay for a long while was the only real option for a consumer-to-consumer marketplace. Now there are dozens of competitors and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) is the massive one. A company that has billions of monthly active users is a formidable foe. It is amazing that eBay has done this well facing down its competitors.
The stock chart this year has done well up 30% year-to-date. This is 40% better than the S&P 500. It’s also up 60% in two years, so management is on the right track. Unfortunately, EBAY stock fell 10% in just about a week. Still, it’s uncertain if it has hit a strong bottom. However, it is falling into a support zone. From a trading perspective I expect buyers as it approaches $63 per share. This has been a level in contention since the February super Spike.
That rally ended in tears as the stock fell 20% into the March correction. Luckily, the fans stepped up in droves and mounted an incredible 43% rally into the end of July. Are we dizzy yet? August so far has been nothing but pain. But the bulls remain in charge inside an ascending channel of higher-lows and higher-highs. Clearly the stock moves fast, therefore I expect volatility.
Fundamentally valuation is cheap with a 16 price-to-earnings ratio. That won’t be a reason to act on it this week. The idea here is to swing trade it with a tight stop. This is more about the rinse-and-repeat price action than anything else. Long-term investors can also participate with their own level of risk management. However, they would need to wear a trader hat if the markets suddenly sour.
Novavax (NVAX)
Source: Charts by TradingView
My second pick today has been an underdog for decades. As the world still struggles with Covid-19 and its variants, Novavax is struggling to bring its medicine to market. The company has failed to produce one yet since its existence started in the 1990s. The NVAX stock as seen its peaks and valleys, yet investors are still resilient.
I last traded it five years ago when it collapsed under $1 per share (pre-split). Last week, the stock fell more than 10% as management once again delayed its application to the FDA. They have promised the world billions of jabs. This delay is a heart-breaker from an investment and humanitarian perspective. These delays are troublesome but maybe this time it’s different. And that’s at the heart of the bullish thesis this month.
Moreover, NVAX stock is falling into a support zone. As it approaches $177 per share it finds buyers at least for the last three months. This is a level that has been in contention for a whole year. The history of these levels in fact date back 20 years. The buyers are likely to fight for it now.
7 Materials Stocks Ready to Supply the Infrastructure Boom
There isn’t much of a fundamental metric story to tell until they release the vaccine. They are reporting higher sales, but quite frankly it won’t matter unless they bring one to market. Experts are sure that this vaccine is the one that will put them on the map. The more the better for the sake of saving lives. My hope is that management will have good news soon.
Stocks to Buy: SPDR S&P Biotech ETF (XBI)
Source: Charts by TradingView
The iShares Biotechnology ETF (NASDAQ:IBB) and the Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEARCA:XLV) recently challenged their all-time highs. The XBI stock is so far lagging and miles away from its high watermark. Nevertheless, there could be a potential rally brewing. This is a technical setup with a sharp recent resistance line that could turn into a trigger.
Breaking through $131 per share would ignite a momentum trade. The opportunity is then a 10% rally before it hits resistance at $140 per share. There is support below and resistance above. Usually that builds tension and all they need is a spark. This is a purely technical setup where it is important to wait for the trigger.
This one is more time and level sensitive than the other two opportunities. In such cases, it pays to wait for confirmation of the trigger. Alternatively, traders could buy the dip into $122 per share. Regardless, there needs to be tight stops to limit the downside in case of failure.
Longer term, investors can also consider XBI stock at these levels. It has fallen from the February highs into a pivot zone. The $120 per share has been in contention for a year. Last July it failed, but then the bulls prevailed in a big way in November. That sparked a 40% rally that now has completely reverted.
This is part of normal price action albeit more exaggerated than ideal. Nevertheless, when the stock revisits a breakout line, it’s testing it for footing. As long as they hold above $120 per share, the bulls retain the upper hand. Breaking above $141 per share with bring new life to the rally.
We Are Missing Puzzle Pieces
Patience is key and moderation limits the potential damage. At this point, it would be good to remind everyone that we don’t know what we don’t know. What look like stocks to buy now can become nightmare trade.
Even the experts on Wall Street are making most of it up as they go. These macroeconomic conditions are new to everyone, including the government. They are doing their best but a lot of this is experimental.
There could be negative side effects that are in hiding. Surprise headlines are potential catalysts – and they go in both directions. This week is full of inflation reports. Those are important because they could dictate what the Federal Reserve does and when.

2021-08-09 00:00:00+00:00,Olympics-Belarusian sprinter auctions medal to support athletes caught up in crackdown,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/olympics-belarusian-sprinter-auctions-medal-to-support-athletes-caught-up-in-crackdown,,,"By Gabrielle Tétrault-Farber
WARSAW, Aug 9 (Reuters) - Sprinter Krystsina Tsimanouskaya, who was removed from the Tokyo Olympics by the Belarusian team after she criticised her coaches, is auctioning a medal from the 2019 European Games to support athletes who say they have been targeted by authorities.
Belarusian team officials took the 24-year-old to Tokyo's Haneda airport against her wishes on Aug. 1, a day before she had been set to run the 200m.
She refused to board the flight home and has since sought refuge in Poland, fearing for her safety if she returned to Belarus.
Tsimanouskaya told Reuters the reason she had been removed from the team was her public criticism of ""the negligence of our coaches.""
She said she had been entered in the 4x400m relay without her knowledge after some team members were found to be ineligible to compete because they had not undergone enough doping tests.
The Belarusian Sport Solidarity Foundation, a group that supports athletes jailed or sidelined for their political views, said on Monday the medal was being auctioned at Tsimanouskaya's request in support of Belarusian athletes ""who suffered from the actions of Lukashenko's regime.""
As of Monday morning, bids for the medal had reached $5,200 on eBay.
President Alexander Lukashenko has been accused of orchestrating an unprecedented crackdown on demonstrators and opposition figures in the wake of a presidential election held a year ago that critics and observers say was rigged. He denies electoral fraud.
The crackdown has affected elite athletes, some of whom have been jailed for joining street protests.
In a statement carried by the foundation, Tsimanouskaya said the silver medal she won in the team relay at the 2019 European Games in the Belarusian capital Minsk carried special meaning.
""Those competitions were extremely important for me as they were held at the home arena,"" she said. ""Lots of people, including my family and relatives, came to cheer for me.""
The International Olympic Committee (IOC) on Friday ordered two Belarusian officials - athletics head coach Yuri Moisevich and team official Artur Shumak - to have their accreditation revoked and be removed from the Games.
The Belarusian Olympic Committee has said coaches withdrew Tsimanouskaya from the Tokyo Olympics on doctors' advice about her emotional and psychological state.
In an exclusive interview with Reuters in Warsaw on Thursday, Tsimanouskaya said the two officials had told her the order to send her home came from ""high up"" in Belarus.

2021-08-07 00:00:00+00:00,eBay Earnings: What to Watch,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/ebay-earnings%3A-what-to-watch-2021-08-07,,,"Investors have high expectations heading into eBay's (NASDAQ: EBAY) earnings report in just a few days. The online marketplace benefited from an ideal selling environment in the last year that helped it gain millions of new buyers and sellers on its platform.
Wall Street responded to the good news by lifting eBay's stock over 30% since just the start of 2021. But that rally will be tested when the company announces its Q2 results on Wednesday, Aug. 11. Let's look at some metrics to watch for in that report.
Image source: Getty Images.
1. Sales gains
The pandemic boost should slow this quarter as eBay starts to lap some of the biggest demand surges of the COVID-19 physical retailing shutdown. Sales will rise just 5%, according to Wall Street projections.
The better number to watch is organic sales gains, which should land between 8% and 10%, if management's late April forecast was right. Sure, that's about half the growth that eBay achieved in Q1. But the gains will come on top of last year's 29% sales spike.
Look for executives to highlight new selling niches that are helping extend eBay's reach. Lately these wins have included designer watches, collectible sneakers, and lightly used apparel. eBay has a good shot at developing large revenue streams from some of these lines as it connects buyers with sellers.
2. Operating margin
The profit outlook has been brightening for most e-commerce businesses in 2021, but eBay's is even better. Its middleman status means it doesn't have to worry as much about expensive supply chain and warehousing upgrades. Higher prices aren't a big deal, either, unless they start to hurt sales volumes.
Those factors help explain why eBay generates so much more operating profit than its vertically integrated rivals like Walmart (NYSE: WMT). Earnings are also goosed by rising seller fees, which recently reached 10% of sales. Success in these scores should show up in an operating margin that continues creeping toward 30% of revenue while rivals stay stuck in the single digits.
3. The new outlook
eBay's short-term outlook might attract plenty of attention on Wednesday. Heading into the report, Wall Street is looking for sales to rise about 11% in Q3 -- on top of a 25% increase a year ago. Earnings are currently projected to rise to $0.90 per share from $0.85 per share.
CEO Jamie Iannone and his team might issue a much different detailed forecast as part of Wednesday's report. Strong buyer engagement into the second half of 2021 would support a more bullish forecast. Slowing economic growth and additional COVID-19 outbreaks, on the other hand, might convince management to be more conservative.
In either case, eBay shareholders are likely to benefit from the business's ideal balance between growth potential and current earnings production. Add in a rising dividend, and you've got a formula for market-beating returns over time, regardless of whether eBay thrills Wall Street in its August 11 earnings report.

2021-08-06 00:00:00+00:00,Why Vimeo Stock Tanked Today,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-vimeo-stock-tanked-today-2021-08-06,,,"What happened
Shares of Vimeo (NASDAQ: VMEO) were tumbling on Friday after the company reported disappointing second-quarter earnings. The recent spin-off from IAC/InterActivCorp was down as much as 17.1% on the news. As of 1:01 p.m. EDT, the stock was down 14.6%.
So what
Vimeo reported a second-quarter earnings per share loss of $0.13, which was worse than the $0.05 loss analysts were expecting. The company is also seeing a worsening trend in monthly subscriber and revenue growth. Vimeo's revenue grew 46% year over year in April but has slowed every month since, hitting 35% year-over-year growth in July. Subscriber growth followed the same trend, going from 21% year-over-year growth in April down to 16% year-over-year growth in July.

On a more positive note, total revenue grew 43% year over year in Q2 to $96 million, while gross margin expanded from 66% to 73% during the period. Vimeo also generated $18 million in free cash flow in the quarter, meaning that while the company may show EPS losses according to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the underlying business is still generating cash for shareholders. Enterprise revenue grew 80% in the quarter, which shows the strong traction Vimeo is getting with Fortune 500 clients like eBay and Williams-Sonoma.
Now what
While Vimeo's stock is now trading at a discount from earlier in the week, the company still has a market cap north of $6 billion. With $397 million in projected full-year 2021 revenue, that gives shares a forward price-to-sales ratio of 15.1 after this drop. That's not crazy expensive, but it's not cheap, either.

2021-08-06 00:00:00+00:00,Buy WISH Stock For The Growth Potential,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/buy-wish-stock-for-the-growth-potential-2021-08-06,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
With shares of ContextLogic (NASDAQ:WISH) up 16% in the past five trading sessions, should investors take a leap of faith on the e-commerce start-up?
Source: sdx15 / Shutterstock.com
San Francisco-based ContextLogic operates Wish, an e-commerce platform that facilitates transactions between online sellers and buyers. Think of it as a newer, smaller version of eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY). Like eBay, Wish allows sellers to list products on its platform and sell them directly to consumers. Wish works with a variety of financial technology companies and service providers to facilitate payments between sellers and buyers. Wish does not stock products itself and, unlike eBay, does not manage returns when consumers are unsatisfied with what they have purchased.
While WISH stock has popped in recent days, its share price remains down 45% on the year and currently trades at $10.55. Since going public last December, ContextLogic’s stock is down 55%. Following its initial public offering (IPO), the stock ran up to a peak of $32.85 in late January of this year before coming down 68% to its current level. After bottoming at $7.52 a share in late May, ContextLogic’s stock looks to now be on an upsurge and might be worth adding to a portfolio.
Low Income Differentiator
In addition to ContextLogic not managing returns, the company also differentiates itself by targeting low-income households who are extremely price-conscious, especially throughout Europe. In a survey published by the company, three-quarters (75%) of ContextLogic customers prioritized the price of an item over brand or delivery time. The average price of an item sold on the Wish platform is less than $20. While targeting low income consumers might provide ContextLogic with a niche, it seems to have left analysts struggling to figure out the company.

7 Coronavirus Stocks to Buy as the Delta Variant Rises
Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) recently downgraded ContextLogic to a “neutral” rating from a “buy” previously and put a $12 price target on the share price. While the Bank of America downgrade got a lot of attention, its $12 price target is the lowest current rating on WISH stock. Among 10 analysts who have 12-month price forecasts on ContextLogic stock, the median price target is $17.50, with a high estimate of $24.00 per share. The median price target represents a potential 67% increase from the stock’s current level.
Buildout And Growth
While small and less than half the age of eBay and other e-commerce giant Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), ContextLogic is growing quickly and building out its operations. The company is currently expanding its logistics business, reducing its shipping times and lowering its shipping rates. The company has successfully grown its monthly active users (MAUs) five-fold from 21 million in 2015 to 107 million at the end of 2020.
ContextLogic has also succeeded in signing up new merchants to Wish. The company now has more than 550,000 partner merchants and more than 50,000 local partners that join to gain access to Wish’s customer base. And ContextLogic is increasing its advertising revenue at a fast pace. The company has forecast that its advertising business could double to $100 million in revenue per quarter by 2025. That ad forecast is likely attainable as the number of users and merchants on the Wish platform continues to grow.
And, perhaps most importantly, ContextLogic is finding ways to further monetize its users. Buyers who spent $10 on the Wish platform in 2016, spent closer to $20 in 2017 and continue to grow their spending. This trend of increased spending builds a foundation for long term revenue growth at ContextLogic.
Buy WISH Stock
While not a slam dunk, WISH stock has enough upside potential and is affordable enough at its current price of $10 per share to justify taking a position. The company’s outlook is positive and growth is strong, and the company seems to be taking the right steps to expand the business and ensure it is sustainable over the long-term. Going forward, it will be interesting to see if the Wish platform continues to focus on low-income consumers or expands to a higher end clientele. Regardless, ContextLogic stock is a buy for investors looking for a start-up that is growing fast.

2021-08-06 00:00:00+00:00,The Silver Lining for eBay in Amazon's Q2 Report,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/the-silver-lining-for-ebay-in-amazons-q2-report-2021-08-06,,,"Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) reported second-quarter results last week that were less than fantastic, sending its stock price down by 7.5%. Since eBay's (NASDAQ: EBAY) business is similar to Amazon's, eBay's stock price fell along with Amazon's.
The thinking is that if Amazon reported a less-than-stellar quarter, eBay probably had a bad quarter as well. However, there was a silver lining in Amazon's report that was a good sign for eBay when it reports second-quarter earnings on Aug. 11. Let's take a closer look at what that was.
Amazon reported an 83% increase in ad revenue. Image source: Getty Images.
Ad revenue is emerging
Amazon increased ad revenue by 83% from the same quarter a year ago. What's more, the segment has accelerated its growth rate in four consecutive quarters. Certainly, businesses appreciate the opportunity to get the attention of 200 million-plus Prime members. These customers have their payment information on file, have access to fast and free shipping services, and are one click away from making a purchase. By advertising on Amazon, marketers are piggybacking on the infrastructure, physical and digital, that Amazon has built.
Similarly, eBay is building out an advertising business. The company has 187 million active buyers, who also have payment information on file and are a few clicks away from purchasing. The difference here is that eBay's buyers are not paying members who get fast and free shipping access. Amazon doesnt reportits total active buyers, but you can assume it's much larger than the 200 million Prime members.
Therefore, eBay will not generate as much ad revenue as Amazon will, but it can still benefit from the trend of businesses looking to market to e-commerce shoppers with payment information on file. Indeed, in all of 2020, eBay reported $1 billion in ad revenue, while Amazon earned $7.9 billion in the most recent quarter alone.
Importantly, ad revenue comes with high-profit margins. There is little cost associated with incremental ad sales after spending on the initial technology to build out the service offering. The process is mostly automated. Therefore, boosting ad sales as a percentage of overall revenue could increase profitability for Amazon and eBay alike.
What this could mean for investors
Data source: YCharts
Admittedly, Amazon's reported deceleration in retail sales is not good news for eBay. It likely indicates consumers shifting their shopping behavior back to brick-and-mortar stores as economies reopen worldwide. Still, the trend is just a reversal from the short-term pandemic boost. In the long run, more and more shopping will be done online. The convenience benefits far outweigh shopping in brick-and-mortar stores.
Meanwhile, investor pessimism on these two e-commerce stocks has dropped their prices to attractive levels. Investors can buy Amazon at a price-to-earnings ratio near three-year lows, and eBay is trading at a very favorable P/E ratio of 16.56 (see chart). There could be additional volatility ahead for their stock prices as economies continue to reopen. Long-run investors can put these stocks on their watch lists and wait for an opportunity to get these great companies at bargain prices.
