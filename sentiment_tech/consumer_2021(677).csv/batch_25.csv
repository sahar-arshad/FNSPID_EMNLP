2021-02-25 00:00:00+00:00,What Is The Likelihood of eBay's Stock Rising?,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/what-is-the-likelihood-of-ebays-stock-rising-2021-02-26,,,"eBay’s stock (NASDAQ: EBAY) fell by 2.3% over the last five trading days. In comparison, the broader S&P500 fell by 1.2% over the last five trading days. For FY 2020 eBay reported revenues at $10.3 billion, up 19% y-o-y and earnings for continuing operations were at $3.58 per share compared to $1.79 in the previous year. The increase in EPS was due to a higher revenue and improvement in operating margin.  Now, is eBay’s stock poised to grow? We believe that there is a 59% chance of a rise in eBay’s stock over the next month (twenty-one trading days) based on our machine learning analysis of trends in the stock price over the last five years. See our analysis on eBay’s Stock Chances Of Rise for more details.

eBay stock declined 2.3% over a five day trading period ending 2/22/2021, compared to broader market (S&P500) rise of 1.2%

While eBay stock may have moved, 2020 has created many pricing discontinuities which can offer attractive trading opportunities. For example, you’ll be surprised how the stock valuation for Altria Group, Inc vs. eBay shows a disconnect with their relative operational growth. You can find many such discontinuous pairs here.

2021-02-25 00:00:00+00:00,Analysts Expect 10% Upside For QQQM,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/analysts-expect-10-upside-for-qqqm-2021-02-25,,,"Looking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at ETF Channel, we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. For the Invesco NASDAQ 100 ETF (Symbol: QQQM), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $146.39 per unit.
With QQQM trading at a recent price near $133.24 per unit, that means that analysts see 9.87% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of QQQM's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are Verisk Analytics Inc (Symbol: VRSK), DexCom Inc (Symbol: DXCM), and eBay Inc. (Symbol: EBAY). Although VRSK has traded at a recent price of $167.53/share, the average analyst target is 16.17% higher at $194.62/share. Similarly, DXCM has 12.78% upside from the recent share price of $405.64 if the average analyst target price of $457.47/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting EBAY to reach a target price of $66.95/share, which is 12.75% above the recent price of $59.38. Below is a twelve month price history chart comparing the stock performance of VRSK, DXCM, and EBAY:
Below is a summary table of the current analyst target prices discussed above:
NAME SYMBOL RECENT PRICE AVG. ANALYST 12-MO. TARGET % UPSIDE TO TARGET
Invesco NASDAQ 100 ETF QQQM $133.24 $146.39 9.87%
Verisk Analytics Inc VRSK $167.53 $194.62 16.17%
DexCom Inc DXCM $405.64 $457.47 12.78%
eBay Inc. EBAY $59.38 $66.95 12.75%
Are analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past. These are questions that require further investor research.

Therefore, a good first due diligence step in forming an expectation of annual yield going forward, is looking at the history above, for a sense of stability over time. This can help in judging whether the most recent dividends from these companies are likely to continue. If they do continue, the current estimated yields on annualized basis would be 1.58% for Progress Software Corp, 1.19% for eBay Inc., and 4.47% for Clearway Energy Inc.

2021-02-23 00:00:00+00:00,3 Top Stocks for Retirees,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-top-stocks-for-retirees-2021-02-23,,,"Once you're retired, your financial priorities change. You'll focus more on preserving as opposed to accumulating assets, so your portfolio needs to reflect that more cautious posture.
But retirement can last for several decades, which means you have plenty of time to invest in individual stocks in addition to more stable financial instruments like bonds and index funds. With that in mind, let's look at why Constellation Brands (NYSE: STZ), PepsiCo (NASDAQ: PEP), and eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY) could help lift your retirement portfolio.
Image source: Getty Images.
1. Constellation Brands
Alcohol is considered a consumer staple product, meaning demand usually rises through a wide range of economic environments. Constellation Brands illustrated that stability during 2020 as sales rose 3%, even as consumers drastically shifted the way they purchase beer and wine.
That boost included an 8% increase in beer sales that translated into market-share growth against rivals like Anheuser Busch InBev and Molson Coors. Constellation Brands' focus on premium imports, spanning brands like Modelo and Corona, allowed it to keep growing while these global conglomerates shrank. Its hard-seltzer release added a new niche to its portfolio, too.
Constellation Brands isn't growing as quickly as Boston Beer, but the business brings other factors -- like a larger portfolio and higher profit margins -- that retirees will appreciate. Gushing cash flow also means you can expect quick dividend growth, even as the company makes bets in areas like recreational marijuana in the years ahead.
2. PepsiCo
PepsiCo looks like a nearly ideal investment today. The company just logged 5% growth in 2020 as its diverse snack and beverage portfolio helped it outperform peers from Coca-Cola to Hershey. The Dividend Aristocrat is expected to announce its 49th consecutive annual payout raise in just a few weeks, too. And Pepsi's 2021 growth outlook trounces its rivals.
On the downside, Pepsi's profitability is lagging as management pours resources into fixing manufacturing bottlenecks and tilting the business more toward growth. That financial priority will also mean far lower stock-buyback spending this year.
But CEO Ramon Laguarta and his team have demonstrated how that growth posture can reward investors with steady market-share gains and robust cash flow. Profitability hikes should eventually follow those wins, boosting shareholders' returns even higher.
3. eBay
Retirees have many great options when seeking exposure to online retailing, but eBay, one of the top global players, is among the most attractive today. The e-commerce marketplace benefited from surging demand during the pandemic, just like its peers did. But eBay's slimmer cost profile allowed it to convert a bigger proportion of those sales to earnings. Operating income jumped 68% last year.
EBAY Operating Income (TTM) data by YCharts.
After reinvesting in growth initiatives, eBay directed most of that windfall right back to shareholders through stock buybacks in 2020. Its recent 13% dividend increase confirms management's commitment to that cash-return channel, too.
Fiscal 2021 will no doubt be volatile as growth rates begin going up against year-ago spikes from the early days of the pandemic. The good news is that eBay's middleman selling approach shifts much of that cost to other parties, allowing shareholders to benefit from e-commerce growth without taking on too much risk. That's an attractive financial trade-off, especially for investors at or near retirement.

2021-02-21 00:00:00+00:00,Here's What We Like About eBay's (NASDAQ:EBAY) Upcoming Dividend,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/heres-what-we-like-about-ebays-nasdaq%3Aebay-upcoming-dividend-2021-02-21,,,"Some investors rely on dividends for growing their wealth, and if you're one of those dividend sleuths, you might be intrigued to know that eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY) is about to go ex-dividend in just 4 days. If you purchase the stock on or after the 26th of February, you won't be eligible to receive this dividend, when it is paid on the 19th of March.
eBay's next dividend payment will be US$0.18 per share, and in the last 12 months, the company paid a total of US$0.72 per share. Based on the last year's worth of payments, eBay has a trailing yield of 1.2% on the current stock price of $61.98. We love seeing companies pay a dividend, but it's also important to be sure that laying the golden eggs isn't going to kill our golden goose! As a result, readers should always check whether eBay has been able to grow its dividends, or if the dividend might be cut.
Dividends are typically paid out of company income, so if a company pays out more than it earned, its dividend is usually at a higher risk of being cut. eBay is paying out just 18% of its profit after tax, which is comfortably low and leaves plenty of breathing room in the case of adverse events. Yet cash flows are even more important than profits for assessing a dividend, so we need to see if the company generated enough cash to pay its distribution. Luckily it paid out just 23% of its free cash flow last year.
It's positive to see that eBay's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut.

Have Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?
Companies with consistently growing earnings per share generally make the best dividend stocks, as they usually find it easier to grow dividends per share. If business enters a downturn and the dividend is cut, the company could see its value fall precipitously. Fortunately for readers, eBay's earnings per share have been growing at 17% a year for the past five years. The company has managed to grow earnings at a rapid rate, while reinvesting most of the profits within the business. Fast-growing businesses that are reinvesting heavily are enticing from a dividend perspective, especially since they can often increase the payout ratio later.
Many investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. In the past two years, eBay has increased its dividend at approximately 13% a year on average. It's great to see earnings per share growing rapidly over several years, and dividends per share growing right along with it.
Final Takeaway
Is eBay worth buying for its dividend? eBay has been growing earnings at a rapid rate, and has a conservatively low payout ratio, implying that it is reinvesting heavily in its business; a sterling combination. It's a promising combination that should mark this company worthy of closer attention.
With that in mind, a critical part of thorough stock research is being aware of any risks that stock currently faces. For example, we've found 3 warning signs for eBay that we recommend you consider before investing in the business.

*Stock Advisor returns as of November 20, 2020
This video was recorded on February 9, 2021.
Chris Hill: It's Tuesday, February 9th. Welcome to MarketFoolery, I'm Chris Hill. With me today, Mr. Bill Barker. Thanks for being here.
Bill Barker: Thanks for having me.
Hill: We've got commercial real estate. We're going to talk education, tech, and we will dip into the Fool Mailbag. We're going to start with the deal of the day, which features the stock of the day, Glu Mobile, a developer of mobile games. Shares of Glu Mobile up more than 30% because it is being bought by Electronic Arts, and this is a cash deal. Shares of Electronic Arts are up slightly as well, which is always my indication that Wall Street as a group thinks that they're paying a good price for this.
Barker: Yes, or that the deal simply makes sense. You're right to point out that looking at the acquirers stock movement, usually, if you don't know anything at all, you are guessing that it's going to go down on the day off, but in the recent past, it's been much more the acquirer's stock has gone up. I don't think that's because they're getting some special great price. Certainly, not getting Glu Mobile wallet's down, but it's a deal that obviously makes sense. Game maker acquiring a mobile game maker, it doubles mobile business, and it gives them some high profile names to add to the ones they already have.
Hill: As we see from time-to-time, when deals are made regardless of the industry, shares of Zynga are up 4%, just because Zynga's in the business of mobile games, and a deal like this, among other things, is this tested stamp of approval on mobile games as a growth area.
Barker: Sure. You look at something like Glu Mobile's better known game, best known, expose Kim Kardashian, Hollywood. I don't know as much about that game as you do, Chris. [laughs] I haven't played it as much as you, I suppose. I've never played it and surely you have.
Hill: I've never even heard of this game until you just mentioned it.
Barker: You didn't know that was the feature for [laughs] Glu Mobile?
Hill: I didn't know.
Barker: Leading the headlines on the acquisition. Yeah. So, if you've ever wanted to play something that involves Kim Kardashian in Hollywood, you will, in the future, have to do it under Electronic Arts. Not yet. It's still a Glu Mobile for another quarter until the deal finalizes. Now, get back to your point on Zynga. Yeah, you're going to see everything that looks the most like Glu go up, since it's up 33%, that's going to mean that the things that looks the most like it, if acquired, might be undervalued to the tune of 37% today, and that's what the short-term betting is on at the moment.
Hill: Simon Property Group is the largest mall operator in America, and shares are up 4%, because Simon Property updated and improved their guidance for 2021. We also have Jones Lang LaSalle out with their fourth quarter report. Profits came in higher than expected. Take them whichever order you want, but just on the surface, you got two big commercial real estate companies here with positive signs. Let's just start with that.
Barker: Positive signs, I will give you that. Simon Property is acting a little bit better as a stock at the moment for the day than Jones Lang LaSalle has so far. It's one of the major mall operators, owners, and operators. Obviously, it's been a very tough year, which can be summed up, I think. by the numbers that they break out for Q2 through Q4 in what they've collected. So they say that they've collected 90% of their net build rents. What that actually breaks down to is if you ignore the $100 million in bankruptcy related write-offs, the $340 million in deferrals that they've agreed to on payments, the $410 million that they've agreed to, $210 million on abatements, then it's 90% of that after adjust all that. So really, it's about 70%-75% of the original contracted amounts.
Look, they're letting tenants not pay some things. Obviously, the stuff that's in bankruptcy they can't do much about. They've agreed to collect some rents later. They've agreed to acquire some of, or at least significant parts of the businesses of some chains, rather than have a bunch of stores go under, their owners of those stores since they're in a healthier financial position than some of their tenants. It's been a tough year. They are in the properties you would want to be, and real landmark malls. I think that things look a little better today. They look a little better every day for something like a mall operator than they did three months ago, six months ago, nine months ago.
Hill: This earning season, we've seen almost the scatter shot across the market, across different industries in terms of businesses and their willingness to offer guidance for 2021 and beyond. I think it's reasonable when we're talking about whether it's mall operators or something like Jones Lang LaSalle and office buildings. I think it's perfectly reasonable to sit back and say, ""You know what? We're just not going to know for a while."" There is a version of this for Simon Property where six months from now, and then for the subsequent 12 months after that, we do see this well of customers back in the malls, and therefore, tenants as well, in part, because people have just been cooped up for so long. The same can be true for office buildings as well.
Barker: Yeah, there is a lot harder job for Jones Lang LaSalle to give guidance. I'm not sure that they did, or what they're sooner practicing. With Simon, it's a little bit easier. You know what your contracts are for the year. You've got some reasonable numbers about how many of those tenants are going to struggle to pay rent. You can make some projections. You don't have as many moving parts of your business as Jones Lang LaSalle, and you don't have your business. You do have part of your business, part of the rents that Simon Property takes in, or based on percentage of sales within the malls, but still, they've got enough expertise to make some reasonable guesses, as long as they pointed out in their guidance, there are not any further governmental ordered shutdowns of the malls. So what's open now, is open, is part of the guidance. If there are any closed, they have expectations of when those will open. Jones Lang LaSalle, I mean, there are much more tired into the real estate market itself, and as prices adjust, as tenants figure out what they can do, that is something that Jones Lang LaSalle cannot control to the degree from what I can see is comfortable giving guidance right now.
Hill: Chegg's fourth-quarter profits came in higher-than-expected. The education tech company also raised their guidance for the new fiscal year. This is one of those stocks that has doubled over the past year, because when you're in the business of educational technology, [laughs] and remote learning being what it is, not a surprise that we're not seeing a big movement out of Chegg's shares today, but certainly over the past year, this has been a winner.
Barker: Yeah. They have grown the business by about 64% total revenues over the last fourth quarter. One of the reasons they can give guidance is that one thing that is reasonably predictable is that high school, college kids will cheat. Their favorite method of cheating these days is using Chegg which has a library of problem sets, and quiz answers, and things like that that students more and more are using to either get their homework done or use on tests and it's well known in the student community that this is for $15 a month, you get access to a whole lot of potential answers and they are doing that. I don't think that the willingness of students to cheat is probably not one of those variables that has been changed much during the pandemic.
Hill: You think that shows up in their filings with the SEC or it's under risk factors, like, look, we don't think this is likely, but if all of a sudden and mass students decide that they don't want to engage in cheating, that could hurt our business.
Barker: The new morality? Yeah, I think [laughs] I'm willing to take the other side of that risk. Like, if that risk is priced into the stock that students will be more ethical in the future than they have been in the past, I'll take that risk and take the discount that that provides. But look, it's not all their business. When I say that students are using Chegg to cheat, they're also using it for what it says that they're all these materials are designed for, which is to help students learn, help students get answers and guidance through a variety of different modules that they have. You can get plenty out of Chegg from what I hear from the students that I know best and I'm not going to name any names here. [laughs] But you can use it up to a point without paying for anything. You don't get that answer, but you can get guidance. Some they show you a little bit of a problem and sometimes you can use it to just get started on things. But they've got, as I say, 64% is the year-over-year revenue growth. They're not guiding to nearly that level of growth for 20%, 21% having already processed it this year. But I think it's somewhere in the ballpark of 20%, 25%.
Hill: Sounds like there are people in your world that are doing some boots on the ground research and at MarketFoolery, we applaud that. We applaud boots on the ground research in all its forms.
Barker: Yeah, I imagined that if you talk to any students that you know well, they would be able to tell you about friends of theirs who have been known to chegg, it being a verb now, ""chegging,"" among the student population. I'm not saying that you know any students directly who have ever employed Chegg's $14.95 a month services to get a wealth of answers to tests and homework. But if they may know people, these students that you know.
Hill: All kidding aside, historically, it has worked out well for businesses and their shareholders when the name of that business becomes a verb to Google [Alphabet], to Zoom.
Barker: Yeah, it becomes a moat and just as the Zoom (NASDAQ: ZM) is there and there are competing services, some of which may be close to the same level of quality of Zoom. Some things certainly are not, but yeah, if you've got the verb for what you do, you're in good shape.
Hill: Our email address is marketfoolery@fool.com, got an email from a long time listener and member of our Motley Fool One service and he asked that we not use his God-given name, so we're not going to do that. But it was a lengthy email, so I'll just sort of sum up. He prefaced the email by saying that you, Bill Barker, you're his favorite guest on MarketFoolery. That was the start of his email. ""Barker is my favorite."" Keep that in mind when I say what I'm about to say. He went on to respond to some comments you made on last Thursday's show when you were talking about eBay having grown 6% annually over the last 15 years and because I was saying, hey, eBay is sort of underrated. Your response is like, ""You look at the performance, it's not that great."" This guy said, ""Bill is completely ignoring the PayPal spin-off in July of 2015. I can vouch that the last batch of shares of eBay that I bought 15.5 years ago are up about 9X or over 14% annually when considering both the eBay and PayPal shares from that purchase. That doesn't even include the dividends that eBay started paying in 2019. Ticking issue, fairly it seems, with your math.
Barker: A couple of corrections. One is that he didn't say that I was his favorite. He said, ""You two are a favorite duo of mine."" Really, it's you as well and we're just in probably top 10 favorite duos of his from the Motley Fool is my guess. Yeah, now, this is the perfect way, I think, to write something like this is to be polite and then if compliments about the other things that people are doing, come in to play, use them. You're going to get more positive responses, and yeah, he is absolutely right. I was relying on somebody's data, a pretty high profile source.
Hill: Chegg. Did you get it from Chegg?
Barker: It was not from Chegg. [laughs] If it was from Chegg, probably it would have been better off. Now, pretty wondering if, anyway, this source of data was using, I think, just the raw eBay stock price, which had not adjusted for the PayPal spin-off, and therefore, was highly incomplete and my reliance upon that was my mistake. Absolutely, eBay, even if you sold all of your PayPal the day that it's funded off and went out and spent the money that day, I know you still ended up with a lot better return over the last 15 years than 6%. I haven't had time to go back and do the math. But Bloomer, who, in the PSS, we may refer to the author of this email as Bloomer, is absolutely correct and right to correct us and get the record corrected on eBay.
Hill: We got a couple more emails from different people and I did the story as well so I just want to mention. Yes, we have seen the most recent data, three major studies using analytical tools from the American Heart Association about the health benefits of not just coffee but caffeinated coffee. There is study going out of its way to say the benefits that we're seeing in terms of reducing over the long term the risk of heart failure. You want to go with caffeinated coffee because the benefits did not extend to decaf coffee.
Barker: Yes, and the study has also, I think, pointed out that they were promoting black coffee and that the cost of putting in milk dairy and sugar into the coffee were not good for your heart. Yes, we exist on the show partly to promote the health benefits of coffee. Here's yet another highly scientific study. I hope everybody out there still believes in science and [laughs] if that's an excuse to drink a little more coffee, it goes into. This is another one of those studies. The benefits just keep going the more coffee you drink in a day. If you live with somebody who says, ""Oh, but it's not good to have like that eighth cup of coffee."" If you live with somebody like that who attempts to throw that out, you just say no, not according to this study.
Hill: Yeah. At this hour? You're going to have coffee [laughs] at this hour? According to the people at the little place we like to call the American Heart Association and the massive study they did involving thousands and thousands of people. Yeah, I'm just trying to be healthy. How great would it be by the way if Starbucks, Dunkin', whoever, someone just, or even just a local coffee shop, [laughs] just started a small campaign and it just got healthy. That was the tag log. [laughs] Welcome to Joe's coffee shop, get healthy.
Barker: I've had the experience of going into a Starbucks in California where it's mandated that they have to show the warnings. One of those studies that if you were actually a mouse and you had some Michigan lake-sized quantity of coffee, they would register this minute cancerous element that actually doesn't cause cancer. But it's a long warning that was up at the last Starbucks in California that I was at was some years ago. The laws may have changed and are unfortunate and I think that's been refuted in the number of places. Look, if you have hypertension, coffee is not good for you. High blood pressure, hypertension shouldn't be doing it. There are reasons for pregnant women not to drink coffee. But as far as I know, everybody else should be.
Hill: Ask your doctor if coffee is right for you.
Barker: Exactly. Don't take our word for it. [laughs] Please do not take our word for it. Do your own research. But our research seems to indicate that we should be drinking as much as we do, which would be a problem if there were anything wrong with coffee.
Hill: Thanks. Yeah, we have that validation. Bill Barker, always good talking to you. Thanks for being there.
Barker: Thanks for having me.
Hill: As always, people on the program may have interest in the stocks they talk about and The Motley Fool may have formal recommendations for or against, so don't buy or sell stocks based solely on what you hear. That's going to do it for this edition of MotleyFoolery. The show is mixed by Dan Boyd. I'm Chris Hill. Thanks for listening, we'll see you tomorrow.

Twilio (NYSE: TWLO) has been a top performer on the stock market over the past year. The company is a communications platform-as-a-service (CPaaS) business. What that means is that it makes it easy for businesses to communicate with customers via channels like voice, text, chat, video, and email. TWLO stock soared in extended trading on Wednesday after the cloud communications company reported better than expected fourth-quarter results. For the quarter, Twilio reported revenue of $548.1 million, representing a 65% increase from a year ago. 
Prior to the earnings report, TWLO stock had endured a two-day dip, unwinding some notable gains in the process. That said, this name has been on fire over the past few quarters. Following such a massive rally, the strong quarterly report couldn’t come at a better time when the company’s stock price seems to be a little ahead of itself.
“Twilio’s 65% year-over-year total revenue growth in the fourth quarter continued the strength and momentum we saw throughout an outstanding year of results in which we delivered $1.76 billion in revenue,” said Jeff Lawson, Twilio’s Co-Founder and CEO. “These results reinforced that we are addressing a generational opportunity, and with our acquisition of Segment and strong traction with Flex, we are building the leading customer engagement platform to improve every interaction that businesses have with their customers.”

This allows businesses to make real-time decisions, accelerate growth, and deliver compelling user experiences.
The new synergy ties in perfectly with Twilio’s vision of creating the world’s leading customer engagement platform. The acquisition is evidently a catalyst for TWLO stock, reflected from the quarterly result reported yesterday. Segment brings more than 5,000 new customers with it and expands its new owner’s market opportunity by $17 billion. Clearly, Twilio is firing on all cylinders. Here’s why.

TWLO Sits In The Epicenter Of The API Economy
In essence, as we are turning into an economy where everything is built on software, communication APIs are becoming increasingly relevant. What is an API, you ask? API is short for application programming interfaces. We can say that communication APIs are little blocks of code that allow communication between different software to take place. Simply put, it allows computers to communicate with another computer. For example, communication APIs are what allow Uber (NYSE: UBER) to send you texts when your ride is here, or Deliveroo to send you a notification when your food has arrived. 
The company has developed a suite of best-in-class APIs for enabling text-based business-to-consumer (B2C) communications. As most businesses would want to communicate with their clients seamlessly regardless of their phone’s software or version, Twilio’s tools are what many top companies would opt for. Some say this sort of text-based B2C communication is the future. And Twilio’s API does just that. For this reason, many analysts believe the company could continue to capitalize on this niche for growth in this decade.

The Rise In Cryptocurrencies Could Play A Factor In TWLO Stock
Twilio has played a big part in delivering strong two-factor authentication for crypto exchanges like Coinbase, Uphold, Bitwage, BitGo, and many others in the cryptocurrency space for years. With the meteoric rise of Bitcoin, the demand for security couldn’t be more pronounced. The increased demand for cryptocurrency investments necessitates enhanced security protocols. Currently, the standard for access authorization is two-factor authentication or 2FA. For those unfamiliar, 2FA allows users to have an additional layer of protection beyond a password for account verification and protection.
What’s more, Twilio’s 2FA is probably the top dog in the industry as it provides recovery mechanisms in case something happens to the primary 2FA-armed device. As the cryptocurrency narrative becomes mainstream, the critical importance of this functionality could give TWLO stock another boost.

Bottom Line On TWLO Stock
As the building blocks of modern communication, it is no surprise that Twilio is a long-term winner in its space. And we have certainly seen that in TWLO stock. The company’s revenue growth looks to be stellar as long as enterprises continue to move their operations to the cloud. Whether or not TWLO stock could continue to rain money into your portfolio is another question. After all, with today’s gains, the stock is only going to become increasingly unaffordable.
With all that in mind, valuation concerns aside, global digitization should continue to be a strong tailwind for the company. For businesses to remain relevant and stay ahead of the game, enterprises will need to prioritize effective customer engagement, and Twilio’s platform makes that possible. If you have a long time horizon, there is every chance that TWLO stock will grow into its valuation, and then some.

2021-02-17 00:00:00+00:00,7 Hot Stocks To Warm Up Your Portfolio While Waiting for Spring To Arrive,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/7-hot-stocks-to-warm-up-your-portfolio-while-waiting-for-spring-to-arrive-2021-02-17,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
The markets have gotten off to a roaring start in the new year. Of course, many of the hot stocks have been concentrated in the tech sector. For the most part, there has been an acceleration of digital transformation because of the novel coronavirus pandemic. And it looks like this trend is going to be lasting.
However, some of these hot stocks are quite frothy right now. The valuations have reached levels that will make it difficult for the companies to beat expectations.
Because of this, it might be a good idea to focus on those under-the-radar stocks that still offer solid upside potential.
7 Stocks That Elon Musk Loves — And That You Should Too
So which ones look interesting? Well, let’s take a look at seven:
eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY)
ZoomInfo Technologies (NASDAQ:ZI)
Sumo Logic (NASDAQ:SUMO)
Dynatrace (NYSE:DT)
Asana (NYSE:ASAN)
BlackBerry (NYSE:BB)
Aspen Technology (NASDAQ:AZPN)
Hot Stocks: eBay (EBAY)

Until recently, eBay stock has been a laggard. But CEO Jamie Iannone has been making some major changes to the company and they are making an impact.
Just look at the recent quarter. Revenues jumped by 28% to $2.9 billion, which beat the Street forecast of $2.7 billion. The gross merchandise volume grew by 21% to $26.6 billion and the number of active buyers rose by 7% to 185 million.
Part of the strategy at eBay has been to streamline the operations. To this end, there has been the spin-off of the classified businesses. There also may be a sale of the segment in South Korea.
Moreover, the company has been ramping its advertising revenues. For the year, they came to about $1 billion. This has become a nice growth area for the business.  Although, the development of the payments division may have the biggest driver.
Since the start of the year, EBAY stock has increased by 24% to $63. Yet the valuation remains reasonable, with the forward price-to-earnings multiple at 16X.
ZoomInfo (ZI)

ZoomInfo Technologies seems to embody the idea that “data is the new oil.”
And it is certainly true. Data is a key reason companies like Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) have been so successful. But of course, there are various mid-size companies that have rich troves of data as well, and ZoomInfo is a prime example.
The company, which has been around for over two decades, has a dataset on 132 million businesses and individuals. The focus is primarily on helping sales people and marketers find new leads.
As should be no surprise, AI has been essential. This has not only involved building a strong team of data scientists but making various acquisitions. Some of the deals include the purchases of Clickagy (a provider of AI-powered buyer intent data) and EverString (which has a set of AI tools for SMBs).

In the most recent quarter, revenues increased by 57% to $123.4 million and cash flows were $53 million. The company has about 220,000 paid users.
Meanwhile, ZI stock has rallied 37% since early December. And while the valuation is not cheap, the company is still a dominant player in a growing market that has few competitors.
SumoLogic (SUMO)

Sumo Logic is a pioneer in continuous intelligence. This involves ingesting huge amounts of data and making decisions in real-time. For the most part, this has proved quite useful for security applications. But over the years, Sumo Logic has applied the technology to various other categories like IoT (Internet-of-Things).
Growth has been robust. In the latest quarter, revenues increased by 28% to $51.9 million. There have also been nice improvements in the gross margins, which have gone to about 77%.
SUMO stock has not really had the standout returns of other hot stocks in the enterprise software space. But it is important to keep in mind that the market potential is enormous. Based on research from IDC, it’s about $55.1 billion. In other words, there is much runway for growth for Sumo Logic.
Dynatrace (DT)

Dynatrace is not a young company. It was founded in 2005 in Austria. The company would then sell to Compuware and was spun-off in 2019.
Over the years, Dynatrace has built a comprehensive platform that helps monitor and optimize application performance and development. A key to this has been the leveraging of AI.
As software has become more strategic for many companies, Dynatrace has definitely benefited. In the latest quarter, the ARR (Annual Recurring Revenue) increased by 35% to $722 million and the operating income was $53.4 million.
7 Stocks That Elon Musk Loves — And That You Should Too
From the start of the year, DT stock has gone from $26 to $54. But the gains should continue, especially since there will be a growing need for software management services.
Asana (ASAN)
Source: rafapress / Shutterstock.com
When the co-founder of Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) — Dustin Moskovitz — was building the social network, a major challenge was dealing with managing the growth. Simply put, email was not cutting it.
This is why Facebook built its own collaboration system, which was essential. But when Moskovitz left, he took this idea and created his own system called Asana.
But it was more than just about whiz-bang technology. He strove to give Asana an experience much like a top consumer app.
The strategy was spot-on, as the growth has been strong. In the latest quarter, revenues shot up by 55% on a year-over-year. True, a big catalyst has been the Covid-19 pandemic as there has been a scramble for managing at-home employees. There are currently more than 89,000 paying customers.
For ASAN stock, it has had a nice move for the year so far, up about 34%. But the momentum is likely to continue. After all, even as things normalize with the virus, it still seems like a good bet that remote work will be pervasive.
BlackBerry (BB)

BlackBerry has been one of the notable stocks that has been caught up in the Reddit frenzy. Since the start of the new year, BB stock has gone from $6, to a level not seen since $28. Although, the shares have since settled down to $13.
Yet this looks like a good entry point. After all, the company has spent the past few years in a major restructuring. And now it looks like the efforts are starting to payoff.
Consider that the company has built a strong platform for security software for IoT and the ARR has gotten to around $475 million.
To push innovation, BlackBerry has focused on AI to enable better security. This has been implemented in the CyberSuite, which has shown encouraging progress.
9 Meme Stocks That Social Media Won't Shut Up About
But the company’s efforts with connected cars may be the biggest factor for BB stock. For example, the QNX platform has snagged an impressive 19 wins of the top 25 electronic vehicle operators, or about 61% of the market. While this is a massive market opportunity, the technology also has the potential for other categories like turbines, rail traffic and next-generation satellites.
Aspen Technology (AZPN)
Source: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com
Aspen Technology is a veteran of the tech world. Note that the origins of the company go back over 35 years. Aspen got its start from the leveraging of the innovation from MIT, such as to use software for optimization of complex manufacturing environments.
But with the emergence of AI and machine learning, the business has been picking up some nice momentum. It certainly helps that Aspen has deep experience with many large clients. For example, a recent customer renewed a contract for $75 million.
The Covid-19 pandemic has been a factor as well. That is, customers have had to find ways to deal with the disruptions of supply chains.
Aspen Technology also has a highly profitable business. In the most recent quarter, the cash flows from operations came to $37.8 million.
Regarding AZPN stock, it is trading at an attractive valuation, at least compared to the many other red hot stocks in the enterprise software space. The forward price-to-earnings multiple is 29X.

With PayPal's stock price hovering around $300 per share, I can already hear protests that $1,000 only lets you buy three shares (a little more if you buy a fractional share as well). Maybe you're tempted to find a cheaper stock so you can get more shares and make your dollars stretch further.
With stocks, it's helpful to focus on your rate of return, not how many shares you have. I'd rather earn a 20.75% annualized rate of return with 3 shares of PayPal stock than a 10% annual return with 100 shares of something else. Historically, a 20.75% return is a market-beating performance, and very few companies do it. But as we'll see, there are at least 10 reasons to believe PayPal stock indeed can.
Image source: PayPal Holdings.
1. Cash is diminishing in importance
When global behaviors shift, it pays to heed them. For years now, cash has become something we handle less and less, giving rise to the importance of financial technology companies (fintechs) like PayPal.
Even if you ultimately choose not to invest in PayPal, this is a global trend you can't ignore. You should at least invest in some company like PayPal. Life-changing value is being created by businesses operating in this space, and PayPal could be one of multiple winners. But I may be more bullish on this company than the others for the remaining nine reasons we'll see here.
2. Customer growth at 16% CAGR
When eBay spun it out in 2015, PayPal had 181 million accounts. It ended 2020 with 377 million accounts, more than doubling over that time frame and good for about a 16% compound annual growth rate (CAGR). This rapid growth reflects the trend we already noted and demonstrates PayPal's position as a top fintech.
PayPal's customer growth isn't over by a long shot. By 2025, the company expects to have over 750 million active accounts, roughly double where it is today. And much of this growth could come internationally, where there's still a relatively high percentage of cash transactions compared to digital. To seize international opportunities, the company has smartly forged key partnerships with companies like MercadoLibre in Latin America and Ant Group's Alipay in China to take market share.
3. Increasing customer engagement
Linear growth in a customer base is one thing. It's another thing when that growth is exponential, like PayPal's. That because users are more engaged with its services over time. In 2015, the average PayPal user made 28.1 transactions annually. Excluding the positive impact of its acquisition of coupon company Honey, PayPal users transacted 40.9 times in 2020.
One recent product that's increasing PayPal's customer engagement is Buy Now Pay Later. Since launching in October, the company has noticed a 12% increase in weekly spending from those using the service. In short, PayPal is clearly becoming more relevant.

4. Future engagement potential is rising
PayPal's goal is for customers to use its services more and more, and it has multiple ways to drive future engagement. For example, the company plans to launch more services for cryptocurrency this year, allowing people to transact using Bitcoin. From the limited crypto services it already offers, management saw a 50% increase in daily user log-ins, showing just how expanding services for cryptocurrency could drive future engagement.
PayPal also plans to launch new services like stock trading and bill payments to get its users more engaged. And as that happens, it will not only increase its customer base, but the company will also likely generate more revenue from those users than ever before.
5. Revenue growth is steady
Because it's attracting customers and they're spending more over time, PayPal has superb revenue growth for a large-cap stock. From 2015 to 2020, revenue grew from less than $10 billion to more than $21 billion. But over the next five years, management expects revenue to exceed $50 billion, good for a CAGR of over 20% -- an acceleration from past growth.
Don't think that's realistic? Consider how relatively little volume flows through PayPal right now. In 2020, the company had $936 billion in total payment volume (TPV). Compare that to Mastercard, which had $6.3 trillion in gross dollar volume (like TPV, but it includes things like balance transfers). Comparatively, PayPal is still small and has room to grow as cash is continually replaced with digital transactions.
By the way, management's $50 billion revenue target doesn't include the positive impact of acquisitions. This is PayPal's organic revenue growth potential only.

6. Free cash flow growth is accelerating
PayPal shareholders should celebrate its revenue growth because of the company's impressive margin for free cash flow. In 2020, it had a FCF margin of 23%, comparable to its margin since separating from eBay. The company expects this performance to continue with over $40 billion in FCF over the next five years, and over $10 billion annually starting in 2025.
7. Share buybacks are a priority
With that much cash flowing in, PayPal's management has important capital-allocation decisions to make. Historically, it's rewarded shareholders with buybacks. It plans to keep doing the same, with 30% to 40% of FCF being used for future buybacks. Therefore, expect it to buy back between $12 billion and $16 billion in stock between now and 2025, which will help grow its earnings per share modestly.

8. The potential for acquisitions
PayPal doesn't just buy back stock with its cash; it reserves plenty of it for acquiring other companies. Here's why you should embrace management's acquisition strategy: Many previous acquisitions expanded PayPal's total addressable market (TAM), like when it acquired iZettle in 2018 for $2.2 billion. This helped move PayPal beyond simply online purchases to also getting a share of much larger offline commerce channels.
Management still sees untapped market opportunities, like government payments and asset trading, so it will be interesting to monitor potential acquisition targets as its FCF expands dramatically in coming years. And as the TAM grows for PayPal, so too will the stock's ceiling.
9. A track record of benefiting multiple stakeholders
One place I like to look for investing ideas is Fortune's list of the 100 fastest-growing companies, which considers several factors such as three-year revenue growth, profitability, and stock returns. It's a good reference point to see which companies are delivering the best for their investors. PayPal ranked 78th on this year's list.
However, investors aren't the only stakeholders -- there's also the workforce. Glassdoor is a good third-party site to see how companies are doing in this area. It just released its 2021 list of the best places to work, and PayPal ranked 59th. Currently, 78% of employees would recommend working at PayPal to a friend, and 93% approve of the CEO.
For the record, PayPal was one of only three companies to rank on both Fortune's and Glassdoor's lists this year (Mastercard and lululemon athletica are the other two). So PayPal has one of the top track records, giving me great confidence it still has the right DNA to be a multibagger investment from here.
PYPL data by YCharts.
10. Winners win
Sustained business success doesn't just happen. More often than not, it's the result of an impressive market opportunity, a great business model, and savvy management. When a company has proved capable in the past, as PayPal has, it's hard to bet against it. Winners can continue succeeding for a long time.
Over the next seven to 10 years, given everything we've seen here, I wouldn't be surprised if PayPal was able to join a select few companies with a market cap of over $1 trillion. That would make this stock nearly a three-bagger from here and would most definitely beat the market. To me, this opportunity is definitely worth a $1,000 investment today.

LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - Concise insights on global finance in the Covid-19 era.
-------------------------------------------------
SELLER’S MARKET. Britain’s Competition and Markets Authority has thrown a wrench into $11 billion Adevinta’s takeover plans. But Chief Executive Rolv Erik Ryssdal can fish it out again. The watchdog on Tuesday voiced concerns over the Norwegian listings group’s $9.2 billion purchase of eBay’s classified-advertising unit, arguing it would leave Brits with only one other website on which to hawk second-hand goods.
Ryssdal could quibble with the CMA’s analysis, which lumps eBay and Adevinta’s websites together, even though the U.S. group would only have a one-third voting stake in the Oslo-based company. Still, a quick fix looks easier. Britain accounts for just 10% and 1% of respective revenue at eBay Classifieds and Adevinta. Selling or closing one of the local units would avoid a drawn-out battle with the CMA. Ryssdal could then get on with his larger task: justifying his sky-high acquisition valuation for the eBay business. (By Liam Proud)

Adevinta and eBay Classified Group both operate online classified advertising platforms in the UK. The websites - Adevinta's Shpock and eBay Classified Group's Gumtree - allow people to buy and sell a broad range of used or new goods such as clothing, electronics and furniture.
With the sale to Adevinta, eBay will acquire a 33.3% voting stake in Adevinta and positions on the Adevinta board. It means that eBay will be able to participate in the management of Adevinta and could enable it to influence the business strategy for both Gumtree and Shpock, the CMA said.
eBay and Adevinta now have the opportunity to propose potential remedies to avoid the transaction being referred to further investigation.
Ebay said the company and Adevinta do not agree with the CMA's reasoning. But they will work constructively with the CMA and are confident in finding a suitable resolution.
eBay and Adevinta will together propose legally binding solutions to resolve the CMA's competition concerns before the deadline of February 23, 2021. The CMA will then have five working days to consider whether to accept the solutions, or to refer the deal to an in-depth investigation.
Ebay noted that it will provide a further update in early March following the decision.

OSLO, Feb 16 (Reuters) - The British competition authority (CMA) has expressed concerns about the planned acquisition by Norway's Adevinta ADEV.OL of eBay's EBAY.O classified ads business, Adevinta said on Tuesday.
The deal, worth $9.2 billion and announced in July, would create the world's largest classifieds group if it were to go ahead.
Britain, where Adevinta and Ebay compete against other players such as Gumtree, accounted for less than 10% of the consolidated revenues of Ebay's classified business, and 1% of Adevinta's consolidated revenues, Adevinta said.
Adevinta and eBay will together propose legally binding solutions to resolve the regulator's concerns before the deadline of Feb. 23, Adevinta said.
The CMA would then have five working days to consider whether to accept their proposals, or to refer the deal to an in-depth investigation, the firm said.

10 stocks we like better than PayPal Holdings

See the 10 stocks
*Stock Advisor returns as of November 20, 2020
Brian Feroldi: PayPal. So we are going to get right into it. Matt, you want to go first?
Matthew Frankel: Sure. PayPal earnings were good. Back to you.
Feroldi: [laughs] Great.
Frankel: The quarter was impressive. If you look at the stock price, you probably already could have guessed that. PayPal's statistics are just becoming almost too big to comprehend. They did $277 billion in payment volume in the fourth quarter. That's a run rate of over a trillion dollars a year. This was the company that used to be, like, a niche eBay payment processor.
Brian Withers: E-babies. [laughs].
Frankel: Right. They added 60 million new users this quarter. That's a crazy amount. One hundred seventy-one thousand people joined PayPal every day in 2020 on average. That's pretty crazy.
PayPal grew its payment volume by 31% year over year. That's it's strongest growth rate in history. So not only is PayPal getting bigger, but it's growth is accelerating, at these levels. Can you imagine a trillion dollars is flowing through your networks and your growth is accelerating? That's a pretty crazy statistic.
Twenty-two percent revenue growth year over year. For the full year, they added 73 million net new active users. They now have 377 million active accounts. Twenty-nine million of those are merchants. They grew their earnings 31%, generated $5 billion of free cash flow, so PayPal's not going have to raise capital anytime soon. The 2021 outlook, in my opinion, is what's really moving the stock today.
They are estimating that they're going to add another 50 million accounts next year. So yes, they've got a nice boost from pandemic times. A lot of people joined PayPal because they're shopping online more, for example. But now they're expecting that to continue into 2021. Fifty million is a pretty impressive growth. There expecting total payment volume in the high 20s percentages. They already had about a trillion dollars of annualized volume. They're expecting over 20% growth on that. They're expecting $6 billion of free cash flow next year.
Then there's a few exciting products that either just launched or in the works, like the Venmo credit card, which just came out. The reward structure is really unique. I don't want to get too into it right now. Their buy-now-pay-later service, which, if you look at companies like Affirm which is a buy-now-pay-later company, that in itself is $10 billion business or more if it's successful.
They're launching the ability to pay for goods and services at their 29 million merchants with cryptocurrency in 2021. That's huge. Right now, you could spend cryptocurrency at, like, 10 places. It's really more than that, but when you think of like the big-name retailers that accept cryptocurrency, it's really not that much. So that could be a game-changer, not just for cryptocurrency, but for PayPal user engagement.
When I said their quarter was just really good, [laughs] I really meant that. They had a really fantastic quarter. There's not a whole lot more to say about it. I mean, they knocked out of the park.
Feroldi: Thesis on track? That's what you're saying?
Withers: Matt, is it delivering stuff to the bottom line? Is it getting more profitable with this accelerated revenue growth?
Frankel: Yeah, I mentioned 31% total payment volume growth in 2020, 31% earnings-per-share growth. So it is translating into just as much profitability. It's not like they're investing really heavily and eating into their profits to get that, so it's translating into earnings.
They're expecting further 17% earnings growth next year. Like I said, they've got a nice pop during the pandemic, so that's not really necessarily a growth slowdown as much as it is normalization. PayPal's growing impressively, and it's translating into money in their pockets.
Feroldi: PayPal is now a $308 billion company. That is monstrous, and Mastercard is only $340. So PayPal is within 10% of Mastercard.
Frankel: But remember when PayPal was a tiny subsidiary of eBay? Brian, what's your ticker quote say? How much is eBay worth right now?
Feroldi: eBay has actually been a pretty good investment recently, but eBay is $42 billion.
Frankel: So PayPal is roughly nine times the size of eBay. I used to own PayPal because I got shares in the eBay spinoff. I was a longtime eBay shareholder.
Feroldi: That was like, the, reason to buy eBay. [laughs] Come on, spinoff. [laughs]
Frankel: I thought it was expensive then, and look at it now.
Feroldi: Yeah, [it] is a monster. Just a monster.
Frankel: Wait till they figure out how to monetize Venmo. [laughs]

2021-02-14 00:00:00+00:00,3 Stocks to Fall in Love With This Valentine's Day,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-stocks-to-fall-in-love-with-this-valentines-day-2021-02-14,,,"Looking for a new flame this weekend? Growing tech stocks have a lot to offer in an investment relationship. The world is going digital, so there's no shortage of growth in the decade ahead, and technology is highly profitable, too. Three Fool.com contributors think PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ: PYPL), Universal Display (NASDAQ: OLED), and Microchip Technology (NASDAQ: MCHP) are worth your attention right now.
The intersection of banking and technology
Nicholas Rossolillo (PayPal Holdings): Digital payments aren't new, but PayPal has done a ton of work to make them more mobile and touchless. Since the digital wallet company was spun off from former parent eBay back in 2015, shares are up over 670% as the app has become a modern household name.
But PayPal's run is far from over. The fintech company sits at an increasingly important intersection of banking and technology. In a world that has been pushed further down the digital road, flexible options to send money and make purchases is a must for consumers and businesses alike. PayPal and its subsidiaries (mobile money movement app Venmo chief among them) are providing the needed tools, enabling e-commerce, touchless payments in stores, flexible payment terms (its interest-free ""Pay in 4"" buy now pay later option), and a growing ecosystem of related services.
During the final quarter of 2020, payment volume using a PayPal service increased 39% to $277 billion, active accounts increased 24% to 377 million, and revenue was up 23% from a year ago. But what's really powerful about PayPal's business is its rapidly expanding profit margins. With its payments technology infrastructure largely paid for, new revenue is mostly profit. As a result, free cash flow boomed 50% higher. With an average of over $1 billion in cash flowing into its business every quarter, PayPal has the ability to invest heavily in new features on its apps and make acquisitions (like its purchase of e-commerce shopping tool Honey last year).
For investors looking for a stock they can love for a long time (at least a few years, but the longer the better), PayPal checks all the right boxes. Fintech will only grow in importance for the foreseeable future, and PayPal is a top name in next-gen financial services and e-commerce tools.

Universal Display is bright, beautiful, and strong
Anders Bylund (Universal Display): You already love this company's products, even if you didn't know you were using them. It's high time to fall in love with Universal Display as an investment, too.
You know that high-end smartphone you're using? Whether it's an Android or an iPhone, it probably sports an organic light-emitting diode (OLED) screen. Traditional LCD screens shine a light through a grid of colored pixels. In OLED screens, the pixels themselves light up with no need for a separate light source. This gives OLED screens perfect blacks, strong contrast ratios, and low consumption of battery power. OLED elements are great for smartphones and tablets, they're making their way into big-screen television sets, and will eventually become power-sipping light panels for everyday lighting purposes.
As the patent-holding developer of many key innovations within the OLED technology envelope, Universal Display collects royalties and resells the necessary chemicals whenever these screens or lighting panels are manufactured. Moving up from small-screen portable devices to living room centerpieces is good news for this company's revenue streams.
Universal Display's earnings have grown at an average annual rate of 27% over the last five years while revenue has risen by 16% a year. These figures include a sudden slowdown in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the next five years should deliver even stronger growth on the rebound. The company's manufacturing partners are busy expanding their screen-building factories, gadget designers of all stripes are working out new ways to use flexible and transparent OLED displays, and Universal Display is not done developing patents for a larger slice of the total OLED revenue pie.
It's a lucrative business, too. This stock has gained 460% in five years amid surging profits and cash flows. Universal Display has so much spare cash laying around that it started paying dividends in 2017. The quarterly payouts have quintupled since then but the annual dividend yield still looks laughably small at just 0.3% -- because the stock keeps on growing almost as quickly. I'll tell you who's laughing now: It's Universal Display's investors, all the way to the bank.
OLED data by YCharts
So Universal Display gives you torrential share price gains, a deceptively strong dividend policy, and a clear runway toward generous and sustainable business growth.
What's not to love?
This diversified chipmaker is entering a new chapter
Billy Duberstein (Microchip Technology): Diversified chipmaker Microchip Technology is a name to put on your Valentine's Day list after posting a strong recent December quarter. It's no surprise, given that it's widely known many semiconductors are in a severe shortage. After two years of the U.S.-China trade war and then the COVID-19 pandemic, chipmakers cut back on capacity growth. However, new digital applications and an economic recovery are leading to a big boost in demand -- more than chipmakers have in stock.
Microchip is a large and diverse semiconductor company that produces microcontrollers (53.7% of revenue), analog chips (27.6%), FPGAs (7.3%), and licensing, memory, and other services across wide range of industries. In the recent quarter, Microchip grew revenue 3.3% over the prior quarter and 5% over the prior-year quarter, but was likely constrained by supply, not demand. In fact, management guided for 7.5% sequential growth at the midpoint, pointing to accelerating sales.
Not only that, but demand is apparently so overwhelming that management has implemented a first-ever Preferred Supply Program for customers. The PSP allows customers to get prioritized capacity, if they book 12 months of orders that are non-cancelable and non-refundable.
Clearly, we are entering a chip up cycle after several years of headwinds. But not only that, Microchip is entering a new phase, too. Two and a half years ago in mid-2018, Microchip acquired Microsemi, incurring a whopping $8 billion in debt in the process, just on the eve of the trade war downturn. Even though it was terrible timing, Microchip has since paid down $3.24 billion of that debt while also maintaining its dividend.
Management says it plans to get its leverage ratio (net debt to EBITDA) below three by the end of the year, at which point it would explore repurchases. Management also just raised the current 1%-yielding dividend by 5.8%, and plans to raise it on a quarterly basis as it de-levers going forward this year.
A less indebted company with rising dividends amid a semiconductor boom sounds like a good mix to me this Valentine's Day.

10 stocks we like better than Amazon

*Stock Advisor returns as of November 20, 2020
This video was recorded on February 5, 2021.
Chris Hill: We've got the latest earnings from Wall Street. We'll talk sports gaming and Super Bowl prop bets with our guest, Chad Millman. As always, we've got a couple of stocks on our radar, but we begin with big news from the C-Suite. On Tuesday afternoon, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) Founder Jeff Bezos announced he will be stepping down as CEO later this year. Bezos will stay on as Chairman of the Board and taking his place as CEO will be the Head of Amazon Web Services, Andy Jassy. Ron, let me start with you, CEO transitions can be rocky, particularly in the case of a founder-led company. That said, Andy Jassy has been at Amazon since 1997, this really seems like the right person for the job.
Ron Gross: Yeah, two high-level thoughts I have. First, I'm not surprised that Bezos is moving onto the Executive Chairman. It was bound to happen. He wants to focus on things like Blue Origin, Day One Fund, the Bezos Earth Fund. He's got other things he wants to do. I think it's important maybe to point out that this continues the trend of CEOs moving onto an Executive Chairman role rather than just a Chairman role. What that means is he's going to also be an employee, which also signals to investors that he will still be involved in some capacity on the day-to-day basis. Now, is that going to actually happen? I don't know. Is this a move just to placate investors as it was done with Bob Iger, for example? It remains to be seen, but I think the Executive Chairman is a signal to folks like, don't worry, he's not abandoning the ship here. He is going to still be highly involved, even more so than a regular chairman of the board.
As far as Jassy goes, I think Jason probably knows both him and the Cloud business better than me, but he seems like a total solid choice, as you said, having been with Amazon since '97, he built the entire Cloud business. My guess is this is a signal that Cloud will be doubling down on the Cloud, which should be a surprise to no one. It's a very important part of their business. I'm fine with the transition. I'm not selling my shares. I think good days are still ahead.
Jason Moser: I'm with you, Ron. I'm definitely not selling my shares. We'll obviously see in time if Mr. Jassy has the chops to run the business, but I do agree. I think he's a sensible choice given what we know about him and given what we know about the direction of Amazon, the business. It feels like they've really got the North American retail business where they want it. Plenty of growth to come as more and more people go toward e-commerce and the international business is following suit, but I think Amazon Web Services, AWS, that's a key part of the business to focus on. When you look at Jassy's track record there, and if you just go back a few years here and look at the data back in the fourth quarter of 2018, they reported AWS was operating at an annual revenue run rate of $30 billion. A year later in the fourth quarter of 2019, it was $40 billion. Then this most recently reported quarter, it was $51 billion. The asterisks there for this quarter were they actually added more revenue quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year this past quarter than any other quarter in the company's history. Clearly we can see that AWS is where they see the puck going, so to speak, and I think that having Mr. Jassy running the business makes a lot of sense given his history, not only with the company, but his intimate knowledge of the AWS business as well.
Hill: Bezos news overshadowed Amazon's fourth-quarter results, highlighted by a record $125 billion in revenue, which Jason, that was a few billion higher than Amazon's own guidance.
Moser: Yeah. It was what, a week or two ago we were talking about Apple finally hitting that $100 billion a quarter and so Amazon right there with them. It feels like a broken record every quarter we just talk about, wow, Amazon did it again and guess what, Chris? They did it again this quarter. North American retail up 40%, international retail was up 57% and they are inching closer to sustainable profitability there. Again, my eye always goes toward the AWS side of the business first and looking at that. Revenue growth of 28% might have been a little bit below what analysts were looking for, but they also grew operating profit in the AWS segment by 37%. You can really see how they are able to leverage that model and drive profitability for the business, and AWS represents well more than half of the company's total operating profit. Again, going back to the selection of Mr. Jassy, looking at these results, that really all makes sense.
Hill: Amazon had the bigger headlines, but Alphabet may have had the better week. Shares up 12% and hit a new high after a great fourth-quarter, fueled by strong numbers out of Google's core ad business. Ron, YouTube's revenue was up big too.
Gross: Now, a $1.4 trillion company that continues to post impressive results and move higher, beat expectations for both ad and Cloud. Although Cloud continues to lose money, but at a lower rate, they give us details about the segments. A lot of folks were looking at Cloud, but total revenue up 23%. Google services up 22. YouTube, as you said, up 46% incredible numbers, search up 17%, Cloud was up 47%, but still lost about $1 billion, but net income up 43% on widening margins. Incredibly impressive and that will continue to get better as Cloud improves.
Hill: Ron, this is the first time they broke out the cloud revenue and as you said, they're still losing money on it. Did you take the breaking out of the revenue as a separate division as a sign that they're really confident they're close to profitability there?
Gross: Yes. I think they wanted to show you that Cloud as a percentage of the business was improving. We're at about 7% now, so obviously still a small amount, but it is growing. A $1.2 billion loss for the quarter sounds like a lot of money, but that is improving too. We saw those margins really important for this business and the stock going forward widened pretty impressively. That will only go up as Cloud gets closer to profitability. Then if it turns, margins will be significantly higher than they are now and theoretically the stock will as well.
Hill: PayPal's fourth-quarter report cap, the best year in company's history, shares up 14% this week, not just because fourth-quarter profits and revenue came in higher-than-expected, Jason, but PayPal's guidance for 2021 was really strong.
Moser: It was. I mean, this was the best year in the company's history with record everything, basically. We talked about Amazon feeling like a broken record. Well, PayPal's getting there too. It seems like we're just seeing the same thing every quarter. Wow, they just continue to get it done. When you look at the numbers, that total payment volume for the quarter is $277 billion, that's up 40% excluding eBay from the equation, revenue was up 23%, 16 million accounts added at the end of the year with 377 million active accounts, that's up 24%. The total take rate, which ultimately is what's flowing down to the profitability line for the company total take-rate of 2.21% of slight compression there just as costs continue to come down for consumers, but that's no real surprise. Getting to the guidance, as you mentioned for fiscal 2021, calling for total payment volume growth in the high-20% range with revenue of around $25.5 billion, that would be up 19%. Calling for an additional 50 million accounts added for the year. Listen man, they called for 35 million at this same time last year, they wrapped up the year with more than 70 million, so let's just take that 50 million with a grain of salt, but so many things they are doing well. There was a question on the call in regards to what's really catching their attention, what's being received well, because they're doing all of these new things with credit in with crypto and with 'buy now pay later.' CEO Dan Schulman actually said the biggest surprise was the response to that buy now or pay later offering that they've rolled out for consumers. They've seen a tremendous response. Three million customers using it now, paying with hundreds of thousands of merchant customers, and so just given the growth in that particular space for the IPOs like companies like a firm, you can see. PayPal is just utilizing that massive network and rolling out new products and services to consumers, and it seems like they like them.
Hill: Real quick, before we go to the brake. PayPal is having an Investor Day next week. It's their first time in a few years of having an Investor Day. Is there anything in particular you are anticipating for that, or are you just going to sit back and see what they come out with in terms of their three to five-year outlook?
Moser: I think it's interesting that they really feel comfortable giving that three to five-year outlook at this point, because they did mention on the call here that this shifting consumer behavior they feel like due to the pandemic, this is sustainable and it's not going back, and so I think this big focus on cashless, on mobile, that isn't going to go away. I think really it's just a point of understanding what kinds of products and services they have on their radar to roll-out in the coming years, but I'm going to sit back and take it all in and I will let you know what I find out.
Hill: Shares of Activision Blizzard were up 10% on Friday after a strong holiday quarter. Ron, I know they make a lot of video games at Activision Blizzard, but the Call of Duty franchise just continues to perform well.
Gross: Yeah. That Call of Duty, World of Warcraft, and Candy Crush, which I never understood, are clearly getting it done. This stock is up 75% over the last year and as you said, adding another 10% this week. Numbers are really strong. The revenue is up 21%, with net bookings up 12.5%. Net bookings from digital channels, which is where this industry has certainly moved and is continuing to move, is up 24%. They've got monthly active users now of 397 million. Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War, I love the names of the Call of Duty games, was the best seller across all platforms in 2020, according to research firm NPD. As I said, World of Warcraft and Candy Crush were really strong as well. You've got adjusted earnings up 23%. Guidance was solid, they increased their dividend 15%, you now get a 1.8% yield on that. They authorized the new 2-year stock repurchase program for $4 billion worth of stock. The company, the whole industry for that matter, whether it's Electronic Arts or Take-Two, benefited from the fact that we've all basically been on lock-down, sitting on our couches, some of us playing video games, others watching Netflix. New console refresh, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, certainly also helped. Whenever there's a console refresh, there's a renewed interest in repurchasing or adding new games, so the company continues to execute really well.
Hill: Shares of Unity Software have had impressive games lately, but gave some of those games back on Friday after fourth-quarter results showed that revenue growth is slowing down. Jason, this is a growth stock and we don't like when revenue growth slows down.
Moser: Not even just a little bit?
Hill: Not even just a little bit.
Moser: I guess you're right. I say this as a shareholder, I wouldn't let the market's reaction fool you. This was a really strong quarter, revenue of $220 million and $772 million, well-exceeded guidance set last quarter, for both the quarter and the year respectively. Losses were lighter, guidance for the coming year right in line. They're closing in on $1 billion in annual revenue already. I think this is a business that's doing a lot of what we were hoping it would do. It's just valuation is usually the biggest risk for a company like this, that just IPO'd and it's been on a tear ever since. When you look at the numbers, the engagement, I think it makes a lot of sense. Games made with Unity accounted for 71% of the top 1,000 mobile games in the fourth quarter of 2020. Monthly active end-users who consumed content created or operated with Unity, that reached on average 2.7 billion people per month in the fourth quarter of 2020. That was up 63% from a year earlier. I think that, again, valuation being a little bit of a risk, I think management did a good job on the Call. They set the expectation appropriately, I feel, but some of 2020's success was pulled forward due to the pandemic. There are also some concerns they're not quite as quantifiable in the long term, just in regard to the Apple privacy risk that they talked about on the call as well. All-in-all, this is a tool. It's not only a gaming engine really, what Unity is building here, but it is a creation engine that extends well beyond the gaming universe. I think the long-term story for this business is absolutely intact. Again, as a shareholder, I feel really good about owning these shares.
Hill: Fourth-quarter revenue for Pinterest rose 76%, capping off a year in which they added 100 million users to the platform. Maybe no surprise then that shares of Pinterest were up on Friday and hitting a new high, Ron.
Gross: How about up 270% over the last year? Boy, did I miss this one. It's not about me, Chris. It's not all about me, let's get to the numbers, as you said, just unbelievable. Fourth-quarter revenue jumped 76%. This is for a business that I didn't even understand until relatively recently and I had no interest in until relatively recently. As we saw with Google, ad spending rebounded significantly as businesses moved online in a big way as a result of the pandemic. People started spending again. Ad spending is really popping up and affecting a lot of the advertising businesses that we follow. Now has 459 million monthly users, that's up 37%. As you said, added over 100 million users globally in 2020. Adjusted net income, look at this number, up a whopping 283%. Now, it's not a multi-trillion dollar company, it's still relatively small, but that's still $294 million in quarterly earnings for a company, again, that I had no interest in, but the numbers speak for themselves. Management says they'll continue to invest in the business, that's going to include additional headcount. They're going to expand their international business significantly. They think there's a significant amount of growth there. Guidance, they think revenue will increase in the low 70% range in the first quarter. There seems to be no let-up in that growth.
Hill: Chipotle shares hit a new high earlier in the week, before issuing fourth-quarter results. Jason, I get that expectations were high. That's why the stock sold off a little bit later in the week, but I mean, the same-store sales were solid and Chipotle's digital sales just continue to impress.
Moser: Yes, at first blush, you would wonder what in the world has the market paying 140 times trailing earnings for a purveyor of burritos? I mean, this isn't coffee, Chris.
Hill: A delicious purveyor of burritos.
Moser: Yes, you're right. They are very tasty, I agree. When you couple the execution along with what still appears to be a very significant market opportunity, I mean, I get the market's enthusiasm here. The stock's up 68% over the last 12 months and I think there's a lot more where that came from. Sales were up 11.6% from a year ago. Comps, 5.7%, all relatively OK. You made the point there, digital sales for the quarter grew 177.2%. Accounted for 49% of all sales, half of those were delivery. Listen, going forward, I think it's reasonable to assume that's going to be a big part of this company's story. Working on initiatives like Chipot-lanes that are gaining some traction. They are even testing out a digital-only store closing in on 20 million rewards members. Then talking about that market opportunity, they are going to open 200 more stores this year, on top of the 2,750 stores that they have today. It feels like they could open a lot more from there as well. Again, as long as they can avoid those real problematic things like health scares, for example, it does feel like this is a business that is being very well-managed and they got that Jamie Dimon thing going on with the balance sheet too. It's fortress-like with $1.1 billion to 0 debt.
Hill: Jason, remind me, are we anywhere with breakfast? Because a breakfast burrito is pretty good.
Moser: It sure feels like we keep on hearing rumors and rhetoric. I just don't know that there's anything really firm there, but it feels like it's something on management's radar that they eventually want to introduce. I agree, that would be a stellar addition to what is already a very good menu.
Hill: Real quick, Jason, do you think at some point in the next five years, they take a run at another food concept?
Moser: Honestly, I would prefer not. I think that they have such a market opportunity ahead with just the core Chipotle store. Learn the lessons from the past, right? Get your house in order first.
Hill: The American Gaming Association estimates that more than four billion dollars will be wagered on this year's Super Bowl. An increasing number of those bets are going to be placed online. Chad Millman is an expert when it comes to the sports betting industry. He is the Chief Content Officer at the Action Network, and he joins me now from Connecticut. Chad, thanks for being here.
Chad Millman: Thank you for having me.
Hill: Before we get to this year's game, let's go big picture, let's talk about the overall industry. Just in the past year alone, six states and the District of Columbia have given the green light to sports betting. It's now legal in 20 states, there are at least a dozen more that have legislation that's being considered, is this the greatest time ever in America for sports betting as an industry, because it sure seems that way?
Millman: It's truly extraordinary and it's extraordinary to be a part of it. Action Network, we launched three years ago in January of 2018. At that time, in that moment, sports betting wasn't legal anywhere except the state of Nevada, as we think about sports betting. Then there were lotteries in Delaware and Montana. In May of that year, the Supreme Court overturned the Federal ban on sports betting. New Jersey immediately legalized. As you noted, since then there's been this just tidal wave of states legalizing it. This particular moment is the best moment of all of them. The state of Virginia, you know it well, just legalized online sports betting. The state of Michigan just legalized online sports betting. There is a very big distinction between what is happening in a place like DC, where it's run by a lottery and it's much more rigid in how you can make your bets and where you're allowed to make your bets and a state like Virginia, where anybody who is at any place within the state, can open up their computer, they can play with their phone, and they can register for a sportsbook. It has made the industry explode, when you talk about the places where you can bet online.
Hill: I'm sorry to make the comparison I'm about to make. But it immediately leapt to my mind when you were providing that context of what we have seen as investors over the past few years with the marijuana industry, where an increasing number of states are legalizing marijuana at varying levels, and yet on the national level, we certainly haven't seen that same type of movement over the past few years and there's not a lot of reason to think there's going to be a big push for national legalization. Is it the same case with sports betting where yes, we've got 20 states where it's legal, we've got a dozen more, some sections of those, we're going to see the steady drumbeat on the state level. Is there a drumbeat for national legalization, or does that even matter?
Millman: I don't think a drumbeat for national legalization exists right now. There's just not going to be at a federal level, at a congressional level, the appetite to take it up in any committee. It's just not going to be something that rises to the priority list because it has been legalized in so many states. You can't put the toothpaste back in the tube. Like, New Jersey had $6 billion in handle, that is $6 billion bet on sports in 2020. That's more than Nevada, that's more than Pennsylvania, it's more than Illinois. In two very short years, New Jersey became the bellwether for all of the states that have legalized sports betting. New Jersey is going to have the appetite to then pull back on what they do and have to figure out how to play at a federalized level? No, and none of the states are. Now that it is becoming legal state-by-state, there's no appetite for anybody to figure out, OK, how do we nationalize this.
Hill: Online betting for the Super Bowl is an estimated 60% higher this year than it was last year. How much of what we're seeing in the rise of online betting is natural, we would have seen this no matter what's going on, and how much do you think is driven by the pandemic?
Millman: A lot of it is driven by the pandemic. I think the rise in online betting would have happened. It would have happened at a much slower pace. By slower, I mean, instead of 12 months, it might have been 24-36 months. It's all within five-years. Every state that wants sports betting, there might be two or three that aren't going to do it, but pretty much every state is going to do it. You mentioned off the top, there's 12 states that have some legislation that they are trying to push through, 20 states have done it. This past year we saw acceleration. Colorado launched in May. Illinois, which had legalized it, but legalized it in a politically friendly way, but not a consumer-friendly way then changed. They originally said, you can bet online in Illinois, but you have to go to a legal sportsbook, a brick and mortar sportsbook to do it, and in that case, you can only go to one of them. They gave an individual company the monopoly on doing it. Of course, what happened was the pandemic came, nobody was going into the casinos, so that casino lobbied the state and was like, hey, we need to get online betting, so the state allowed online betting. What you're seeing is an acceleration of states because they're realizing, oh, my God, New Jersey did $6 billion in handle, how do we get a piece of that?
Hill: Let's go to this year's game and specifically prop bets. For those unfamiliar, prop bets, obviously, you can bet on who's going to win the game, Kansas City or Tampa Bay, prop bets are side bets, which really have become a bigger and bigger part of sports betting, particularly around the Super Bowl, because you can bet on things like who's going to be the MVP of the game, how many receiving yards is Rob Gronkowski going to have. You can also bet on some more esoteric things like what's the over-under on the national anthem? Two minutes, over or under. One I saw today; will the jersey number of the first player to score be over or under 17.5. Before we get into the nitty-gritty of prop betting, how do you think about it? How do professional gamblers think about it? Do they think, well, that's just a fun thing to get people interested, but serious bettors don't do it, or are serious bettors involved here?
Millman: Serious bettors are seriously involved here. These are markets that to them they think they can take advantage of. I do a podcast every week called The Favorites with the professional bettor named Simon Hunter. Our entire show yesterday was dedicated to the props and those are called prop, that's short for proposition bets. Another way the people talk about bets are markets. We spent the entire show talking about the prop bets, the markets that he sees an advantage of based on his models, his algorithms, his simulations, where the market is either under-priced or overpriced and he can win one way or the other, he sees an advantage. In the sports betting world, college basketball has always been the sport that a lot of professional bettors love, because the volume of games is so high that bookmakers can't keep up. It's similar to the Super Bowl. There are so many markets, even though the bookmakers are the ones putting them out, like, they get mispriced and the professional bettors know that the public, which is the [...] most like you and me, will come in and make bad decisions and move prices in lines in different ways, and they could take advantage of that. If you ask professional bettors, they would say this is an amazing week.
Hill: Are there prop bets that look particularly interesting to you, either from the standpoint of, oh, I think there's money to be made here, or ones that you just look at and you think, well, that's just fun?
Millman: There's both. I can give you a few. There's some that we've been talking about. I will also say one other contextual framing here. Prop bets have become increasingly more important for bookmakers and bettors in the last five-years. More and more, they've been offering on a game-by-game basis, not just in the NFL, but in college football, in the NBA, in Major League Baseball, college basketball, etc., the ability to bet on player performance. All season long, you could bet from Patrick Mahomes down to the total number of catches for the fourth stream receiver on the Chiefs. There are many, many bettors whose livelihoods are based only on that. That's also helped with the rise in popularity of prop bets.
Some of the ones that I've been looking at, I know that a lot of professional bettors, like the over 1.5 field goals to be scored in the first-half. Largely because the Kansas City Chiefs are the lowest-scoring team in the red zone when it comes to touchdowns in the NFL. They're great, longer drives, big plays, but they're not as effective from inside the opponent's 20 yard line. Oftentimes, this is historic for Tom Brady team's in the Super Bowl too. First quarters are very low scoring. The dataset, if you look back at the conference title games for the AFC and NFC and the Super Bowl for, I think the past 50 games, there's only six or seven that win over 10 points total in the first quarter. You're looking at a high probability for a lot of field goals because teams come out tied.
Hill: There's been a lot of talk in the investing world over the past couple of weeks about GameStop, everything going on there. What will people learn from the GameStop story? Where I'm going with this is, I saw a thing that -- because for those unfamiliar, the Super Bowl is going to happen on Sunday, and on Monday, sportsbooks in Las Vegas are going to come out with their odds for the 2022 Super Bowl. I saw this story a year ago, after the Super Bowl, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, a pretty nondescript team, were 50-to-1 shots to win the Super Bowl. Then a few months later, Tom Brady went to Tampa Bay. All of a sudden the odds went from 50-to-1 to I think,15-to-1. If they win the Super Bowl, how bad is it going to be for some casinos that a year ago were saying, oh sure, 50-to-1, we'll give you that. Is it bad enough that we're going to see a change in that behavior?
Millman: It'll be bad. It'll definitely be some mid to high six-figure payouts. But sportsbooks learned their lesson in 1999. I remember this very specifically. The whole reason I got into sports betting is because I wrote a book called The Odds about guys who bet on sports for a living. In 1999, I moved to Vegas for six months and I tracked professional bettors, and I tracked the bookmakers at the Stardust hotel, which at the time was the premier sportsbook, setting all the lines that every other bookmaker in Vegas and every other illegal bookmaker they followed. It was the tipping point for all the sports betting universe. The Stardust had the St. Louis Rams in 1999 at 200-1 to win the Super Bowl. They took several bets of a couple $100 up to $1,000 and lo and behold, at the end of the year, the St. Louis Rams won the Super Bowl. It didn't bankrupt the Stardust, but it didn't help them. They lost quite a bit of money. After that experience, sportsbooks stopped letting themselves have huge liabilities on futures. You were no longer going to be able to get a team at 150 to 200-1, and if you could get that team, you're not getting down more than $10 or $12. They were willing to take the liability that they felt comfortable with, but not a dollar more.
Hill: Guys, one more news item before we get to the radar stocks, shares of Uber up 14% this week, not on earnings, but on acquisition. Uber is buying Drizly, a wonderfully named alcohol delivery service for $1.1 billion. Ron, this is intriguing to me for a couple of reasons, one of which is, we've talked plenty of times about the Uber Eats part of Uber's business. This is Uber making a billion-dollar investment in that direction.
Gross: I actually like this investment. I don't usually like acquisitions, but I do like this one. I think it makes good sense, especially as more and more states open up the ability for alcohol delivery. I think Drizly is in 1,400 cities and counting now, I'm not sure. Personally, I want it to be any easier for me to get my hands on alcohol. But for you guys, I'm sure that's great. No, I think it makes sense. It's a nice adjunct to their business.
Hill: Well, and apparently, part of Drizly's business in a couple of cities involves cannabis delivery, and Uber was pretty quick to point out they did not acquire that part of Drizly's business, they're just focused on the alcohol. But I don't know, Jason, you hear about food delivery and the challenges with keeping the food warm, all that sort of thing. I think it's one more reason to like this acquisition. It's not like you need to worry about what shape your alcohol is in. As long as the bottle hasn't been broken, you're fine.
Moser: Or just don't shake the beer excessively. I don't know. The name still has me scratching my head a little bit. Drizly sounds like the way you would feel the morning after you get too big of a delivery from Drizly. You know what I mean? Like how are you feeling today? I'm just feeling drizly. But alcohol, we talk about it with restaurants, it's a tremendous margin booster for restaurants. You know why I said Chipotle is not coffee? Well, alcohol is very close to what coffee is. It's a legally addictive substance for many folks. Then for better or worse, I have a feeling that we will see a lot of alcohol delivery in the future.
Hill: Let's get to the stocks on our radar. Our man behind the glass, Dan Boyd, is going to hit you with the question. Ron gross, you're up first. What are you looking at this week?
Gross: Scotts Miracle-Gro Company, SMG. Manufacturer of consumer lawn and garden products. Founded in 1868, for those that are keeping score. Shares up 90% over the last year. Company wide sales, up 105% in the recent quarter. Another hydroponic segment they called Hawthorne had an increase of 71%. Hydroponics is basically growing plants indoors without soil. Dan, this segment is strong with the cannabis industry, which I think will continue to grow and be a nice boost to their business. This is the first time they've ever made a profit in this quarter in the history of the company. Things are going quite well for them. Their first commercial will appear on the Super Bowl in the second quarter of the game. Keep your eye out for ScottsMiracle-Gro. Not too expensive really at 29 times forward earnings. But I don't think this incredible growth continues unabated.
Hill: Dan, question about Scotts Miracle-Gro?
Dan Boyd: Not so much of a question, Chris, more of a comment. Scotts Miracle-Gro, they are all over the place. They have a huge market share when it comes to lawn care products. But I just wanted to say, I miss the Scottish guy they had in the ads a few years back. He had a lot of great personality. I don't know why they got rid of them.
Hill: Jason Moser, what are you looking at?
Moser: Nice week for a company called Synaptics, ticker is S-Y-N-A. I think I've mentioned this company on the show maybe once before, but it's a recommendation I brought into our Augmented Reality service a while back. Done very well for us. They reported a very good quarter this week. The market has received it well, but Synaptics makes its hay by selling its technology to some of the world's largest original equipment manufacturers, companies like Alphabet, Samsung, Sony, Lenovo, and more. That technology covers a very broad spectrum, chips, firmware, software, AI, you name it. They do a lot of different things as we move more toward tech and the capabilities that 5G is going to roll out, which it's a big market opportunity, I think with a lot of runway in front of it and a little bit of a business in transition. It looks like that transition is really working. They're really focused on taking the company toward the IoT, the Internet of things, opportunity. There may be some hiccups in the near-term due to supply chain constraints, due to the pandemic. That's a macro thing, that is not a business thing, so very encouraged with the direction that Synaptics is headed.
Hill: Dan?
Boyd: Synaptics, they're in a pretty saturated market space with all of the different interface technologies out there. What gives them the advantage over their competitors?
Moser: Well, typically, it is the technology coupled with the length of the relationships with those original equipment manufacturers. The longer that you have those relationships, those iterations cycles, those product design cycles, they can take long periods of time, and so you really don't want to switch unless you absolutely have to. That technology coupled with those long well-established relationships has helped put Synaptics at a pretty good place.
Hill: What do you want to add, Dan?
Boyd: I'll go with Scotts Miracle-Gro, because I'm trying to grow my portfolio.
Hill: We're out of time. We'll see you next week.

2021-02-12 00:00:00+00:00,U.S. says it's back at the table to help global economic recovery,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/u.s.-says-its-back-at-the-table-to-help-global-economic-recovery-2021-02-12,,,"By David Lawder and William Schomberg
WASHINGTON/LONDON, Feb 12 (Reuters) - New U.S. President Joe Biden's administration told allies on Friday it was re-engaging with them to help steer the global economy out of its worst slump since the Great Depression, a contrast with go-it-alone approach of Donald Trump.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told her peers from the Group of Seven rich nations that Washington was committed to multilateralism and ""places a high priority on deepening our international engagement and strengthening our alliances"".
Yellen spoke to the G7 in an online meeting, chaired by Britain, at which she called for continued fiscal support to secure the recovery, saying ""the time to go big is now"".
Britain said officials discussed giving help to workers and businesses hit by the pandemic while ensuring sustainability of public finances ""in the long term"".
As well as the United States and Britain, the G7 includes Japan, France, Germany, Italy and Canada.
Italian Economy Minister Roberto Gualtieri said the group had committed to continuing coordinated action to support the economy. ""The withdrawal of policy support is premature,"" he wrote on Twitter.
Biden has proposed a further $1.9 trillion in spending and tax cuts on top of $4 trillion of coronavirus relief measures enacted by his predecessor Trump.
British finance minister Rishi Sunak is expected to say next month that he will extend his economic rescue programmes and that fixing public finances will have to be addressed later.
Britain said G7 officials agreed that making progress on reaching ""an international solution to the tax challenges of the digital economy"" was a key priority.
Countries have been trying to revive attempts at a global approach to taxing giant digital firms - many of them American, such as Amazon AMZN.O and Google GOOGL.O - after progress was blocked by Trump's administration.
Britain called on G7 countries to agree a joint approach to taxing internet giants by mid-2021, a deadline agreed by the wider Group of 20 nations.
HELP FOR THE VULNERABLE
Sunak stressed ""the moral, health and economic case"" for fast global vaccine distribution and said international financial institutions had to help vulnerable countries respond to the pandemic.
The G7 had been expected to back a new allocation of the International Monetary Fund's own currency, known as special drawing rights, to help low-income countries hit by the coronavirus crisis.
Officials from the United States, the IMF's biggest shareholder, had signalled they were open to a new issuance of $500 billion, sources said on Thursday - another shift by the Biden administration.
Yellen urged the G7 countries and international financial institutions to address the challenges facing low-income countries who are struggling to respond to the pandemic, the U.S. Treasury said.
A G7 source, who asked not to be named, said the United States told other countries it needed a few weeks to finalise the SDR increase.
Sunak called on private creditors to give debt help to the poorest countries and said climate change and nature preservation would be priorities for Britain's G7 presidency.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is due to host the first in-person summit of G7 leaders in nearly two years in June at a seaside village in Cornwall, southwestern England.
Trump threw the G7 into chaos in 2018 when he said he was backing out of a joint communique after a leaders' summit because of a trade dispute with Canada.
World Bank President David Malpass said the G7 had a ""good discussion"" of inequality, COVID-19 vaccinations, climate change, economic vulnerabilities and debt reduction for poor countries.
Yellen said the G7 should expect to see the U.S. Treasury's engagement on climate change to ""change dramatically relative to the last four years"".

2021-02-12 00:00:00+00:00,3 Great Dividend Stocks Whose Payouts Could Double,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-great-dividend-stocks-whose-payouts-could-double-2021-02-12,,,"Good income investments often come with strong dividend yields, delivering income that's higher than an investor could find at a bank or by holding a stock market index fund. But the outlook for steady increases to that payout plays a bigger role in your prospective returns.
With that in mind, let's take a closer look at three stocks that are primed to at least double their dividends over the next few years. Home Depot (NYSE: HD), eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY), and Tractor Supply (NASDAQ: TSCO) are great candidates for investors seeking a balance between high payments and quick dividend growth.
Image source: Getty Images.
1. Home Depot
Home Depot's record sales growth in 2020 doesn't differentiate it much from its peers. Lowe's (NYSE: LOW) expanded even faster, in fact, even though both home improvement giants gained market share.
But Home Depot's dividend is another story. Home Depot aims to return 55% of earnings to shareholders through dividends each year, compared to Lowe's 35% target. Home Depot also maintains a significantly higher profit margin than its main rival. These factors combine to create an unusually bright outlook for income investors, who can receive an over 2% annual yield by owning the stock today.
HD dividend yield data by YCharts.
The retailer's last report showed a 26% spike in third-quarter earnings, which bodes well for the annual dividend increase that Home Depot will announce when it closes its fiscal year on Feb. 23. Its 2019 increase was 10%, but sales and profits both hit a much higher level as the pandemic focused people's spending habits on home projects.
2. eBay
eBay's business also achieved a major upgrade in 2020, with buyers and sellers both flocking to its marketplace platform. Sales volumes jumped 18% overall, but its asset-light approach delivered far more profits as earnings rose 25% year over year.
The company dedicated a relatively small portion of its cash to dividends last year, choosing to spend $5 billion on stock buybacks, compared to $447 million on dividends. But management's recent 13% increase to that payout suggests a more balanced approach to cash return is ahead.
It has the resources to dramatically increase the dividend today, but the company took a more cautious approach given the COVID-19 threat to global economies. As that risk subsides over the next year or so, investors should see signs of gushing dividend payments from this high-performing business.
3. Tractor Supply
Tractor Supply's dividend isn't as well established as that of some of its peers, but its latest 30% payout hike makes up for that shortcoming. The rural-lifestyle retailer proved its essential status during the pandemic as customers turned to its stores and e-commerce platforms for their home, animal, and recreational farming needs. Revenue soared to $10.6 billion in 2020 from $8.35 billion a year earlier.
Tractor Supply got a modest earnings bounce from that sales surge since it had to spend aggressively to ramp up its online fulfillment platform. But, as Target's recent experience showed, those investments can push profit margins much higher than its current 9%. Look for this dividend to keep growing along with Tractor Supply's improving profit posture.

2021-02-11 00:00:00+00:00,"Forget Bitcoin, These Tech Stocks Are Better Buys Right Now",EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/forget-bitcoin-these-tech-stocks-are-better-buys-right-now-2021-02-11,,,"The price of Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) recently soared past $46,000 after Tesla invested $1.5 billion in the cryptocurrency and said it would soon start accepting it for payments. It might be tempting to chase that rally, but investors should realize Bitcoin is still a highly speculative investment.
Instead of directly gambling on the volatile cryptocurrency, investors should consider buying three other promising fintech stocks: Square (NYSE: SQ), PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL), and Adyen (OTC: ADYE.Y).
Image source: Getty Images.
1. Square
Square, which provides online payment services for individuals and businesses, added Bitcoin trading to its Cash App in early 2018. It buys Bitcoin and sells it to Cash users for a slim profit, but doesn't charge any additional transaction fees.
Square's Bitcoin revenue surged 731% year-over-year to $2.82 billion, or 44% of its top line, in the first nine months of 2020. Those trades generated a gross profit of $56 million, up from $5 million a year ago, and accounted for 3% of Square's total gross profit.
That surging interest in Bitcoin benefited Square in three ways. First, it offset a slowdown in its seller-based transaction business, which struggled as smaller businesses shut down throughout the pandemic.
Second, it elevated the profile of its Cash App, which surpassed 30 million active users last June. Lastly, it complemented the Cash App's growing ecosystem of fintech services, which includes mobile deposits, free stock trades, and upcoming tax preparation services from Credit Karma.
Analysts expect Square's revenue to roughly double in fiscal 2020, but for a higher mix of lower-margin Bitcoin trades to reduce its adjusted earnings by 5%.
But next year, they expect Square's revenue and earnings to rise 39% and 51%, respectively, as the pandemic passes and its higher-margin transaction revenue rises again. Square's stock initially seems expensive at over 200 times forward earnings, but it only trades at about eight times next year sales, which makes it cheaper than many other high-growth tech stocks.
2. PayPal
Investors who think Square is too hot to handle should take a closer look at PayPal, its larger rival in online payments.
Image source: Getty Images.
PayPal previously shunned Bitcoin, but it started allowing users to buy, hold, and sell Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in late 2020. It also allowed its 29 million merchants to start accepting cryptocurrency payments.
PayPal doesn't generate any significant revenue from Bitcoin transactions yet, but its core business remains strong. In fiscal 2020, its number of active accounts grew 24% to 377 million, its total number of transactions increased 25% to 15.4 billion, and its TPV (total payment volume) grew 31% to $936 billion.
Its Venmo app, which competes against Square's Cash App, accounted for $159 billion of that TPV -- representing 56% growth from a year earlier. Its merchant services volume also rose 33%.
PayPal's revenue and adjusted earnings rose 23% and 29%, respectively, in 2020. It expects its revenue and adjusted earnings to rise another 19% and 17%, respectively, in fiscal 2021. PayPal's stock trades at just under 50 times forward earnings and 13 times this year's sales, which are reasonable valuations for a market leader with an early-mover's advantage in the war on cash.
3. Adyen
Adyen might not be a familiar name to U.S. investors, but the Dutch payments company notably lured eBay away from its former subsidiary PayPal in 2018. eBay plans to transfer most of its merchants and shoppers to Adyen later this year.
Adyen went public in Europe that same year, and its business remained resilient throughout the pandemic. Its revenue rose 28% in 2020, its payment volume increased 27%, and its net income grew 11%.
Analysts expect Adyen's revenue and earnings to rise 40% and 57%, respectively, this year as the pandemic passes, it expands across eBay's marketplaces, and its transactions from smaller businesses stabilize.
Based on those estimates, Adyen trades at roughly 160 times forward earnings and about 60 times this year's sales. Those valuations are frothy, but Adyen could grow into its valuation as the mobile payments market expands.
Adyen doesn't directly support Bitcoin payments yet. But based on Square and PayPal's moves, it could only be a matter of time before it rolls out integrated Bitcoin and cryptocurrency purchases.

The Oslo-listed company's October-December revenue was flat year-on-year at 200.2 million euros ($242.8 million), while analysts in a Refinitiv poll on average had expected 186.4 million euros.
Adevinta's business contracted sharply in the second quarter of 2020 as online sites for autos, real estate and jobs suffered amid Europe's first wave of COVID-19 lockdowns, but users have since returned as conditions eased.
The company's earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), including joint ventures, fell 2% year-on-year to 51.3 million euros in the fourth quarter, beating the 47.5 million euros expected by analysts.
Adevinta in July agreed to buy eBay's classified ads unit in a $9.2 billion cash and shares deal to form the world's largest online classifieds group with a presence in 17 countries, aiming to close the transaction in early 2021.

Key Highlights: 
By necessity, the unique challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic forced consumers and businesses alike to adapt to an online shopping environment. 
Before COVID-19, e-commerce was already growing in the top two markets, China and the US, as people became more comfortable buying goods and services online. In 2020, the pandemic significantly catalyzed changes in this space.
A June survey by e-commerce platform Shopify (SHOP CN) found that 60% of North American shoppers had shifted more of their spending online from March to June 2020 relative to their habits before the crisis. In addition, 53% of those surveyed said that the pandemic had changed how they will shop in the future.
A similar study conducted in 2Q20 analyzing Chinese consumers' spending patterns noted that 66% of people spent more time shopping online during the pandemic.
In September and October, respectively, Alibaba (BABA) and JD.com’s (JD) unveiled autonomous delivery vehicles and robots designed to lower the cost of last-mile deliveries and improve customers' convenience through scheduled deliveries.
In addition to marketing in channels like multi-purpose messaging app WeChat, the Chinese e-commerce giants are utilizing live streams with influencers to create interest in products and promote items with short-lived discounts in a way that can generate sales while entertaining customers.
During the pandemic, small and mid-sized companies in the US and around the world have benefited from platforms such as Shopify (SHOP CN), Amazon (AMZN), Etsy (ETSY), and others that help businesses reach consumers online.
Businesses leverage SHOP’s platform to create an online storefront with the company’s own branding and sell directly to consumers for a monthly subscription fee. While potentially increasing seller margins, one risk to this model is that businesses are responsible for their own branding and promotion.
In contrast, Amazon and others like Etsy and eBay (EBAY) serve as online marketplaces with millions of users. When businesses list their items on Amazon, they gain access to the largest e-commerce site in the US and its fulfillment capabilities but do not retain personal branding as items are listed competitively with other sellers.
While these two models generate different sets of considerations for businesses, both can provide access to online buyers.
Even if lockdowns ease this year, the convenience of having food delivered directly to homes may contribute to some stickiness in revenue growth for this emerging segment.
The European food delivery company Just Eat Takeaway.com (TKWY NA) reported orders in 4Q20 were up 57% year-over-year and saw an increase sequentially as lockdowns were reinstated in much of Europe.
The major US takeout and delivery businesses likewise benefited from a boost in sales related to shelter-in-place restrictions, with the four largest food delivery apps more than doubling revenue year-over-year from April through September 2020.
Similarly, HelloFresh (HFG GR), a subscription meal kit delivery service, reported record order numbers in 3Q20 and had nearly one million more active customers in the US over the previous year.
Software as a service (SaaS) has become increasingly important as companies manage everyday operations complexities, and COVID-19 has accelerated the business adoption of technological offerings.
SaaS offerings are cloud-based, allowing companies to access various tools that help manage virtually all aspects of a business on demand over the Internet and have made communicating more efficient and allowed people to work from anywhere.
Infrastructure-based tools such as Amazon Web Services and Microsoft’s (MSFT) Azure provide a wide range of services, including cloud computing (running websites and applications in the cloud), databases, and storage. Other platforms include Salesforce (CRM), Workday (WDAY), and Twilio (TWLO).
Finding a way to communicate virtually has been a necessity recently, but going forward, the adoption of virtual meetings is likely to remain considerable.MSFT’s Teams, Zoom (ZM), and Slack (WORK) are examples of collaborative communications tools that allow coworkers to catch up on tasks via video conferencing, calls, and messaging.
While the integration of technology into businesses is not a new topic by any means, COVID-19 has driven many changes that have transformed how companies will operate going forward.

During the pandemic, small and mid-sized companies in the US and around the world have benefited from platforms such as Shopify (SHOP CN), Amazon (AMZN), Etsy (ETSY), and others that help businesses reach consumers online.

*Stock Advisor returns as of November 20, 2020
This video was recorded on February 4, 2021.
Chris Hill: It's Thursday, February 4th. Welcome to MarketFoolery. I'm Chris Hill. With me today, the one and only, Bill Barker. Good to see you.
Bill Barker: Good to be here.
Hill: We've got delivery, apparel, e-commerce. We're going to start today with digital payments. Paypal closed out the best year in the company's history. Fourth quarter profits and revenue came in higher than expected. Their guidance for 2021 was strong. Shares of PayPal up around 5% and hitting a new high.
Barker: Pretty much 20%-ish growth year-over-year, and really, I think that more than anything, what is part of today's move is a reiteration that this is very much the middle of the game. This is not particularly pandemic related growth. It's the growth that you expect here. It's the growth that the guidance is continuing to provide. They've got an Investor Day, I think next week. PayPal and eBay, two great tastes that weren't so great together, but have been pretty good separated.
Hill: They have been good separately. We'll get to eBay in a second. But this is interesting because one of the things that has come up over the past few weeks on this show has been guidance. The degree to which some companies are comfortable sharing it for 2021, the degree to which others are saying, ""No, we're not doing guidance right now."" Part of what PayPal shared was for the first time in a few years, they're going to have an Investor Day a week from today. February 11th, I believe, is PayPal's Investor Day. One of the things they're expected to share is their outlook for the next three, five years. For anyone who looks at PayPal and wonders about the valuation, I think the counter to that is the confidence that management has to give guidance, not just for this year, but a week from now, they're going to be sharing it out to 2026.
Barker: That is something to take notice of, because it is a space that is while certainly, far more mature than it would have been five years ago, still so much going on. In the places where PayPal's operating, I'm impressed that they can go out on a limb that far into the future. With the percentage of the business that is coming from the new initiatives, the Crypto, and QR code reads, it's really a lot of pieces that have a lot that's going to happen in the next five years. I think it's going to be a fascinating Investor Day and certainly, one that is going to grab a lot of attention because of what the stock has done and what the company has done.
Hill: You mentioned eBay, share's also up, also hitting a new high. This is a different business, but similar story. eBay's fourth quarter results were better than expected. They offered some strong guidance for the new fiscal year. They are also increasing their dividend 13%.
Barker: I think you're going to find less people super interested in the eBay story than the PayPal story. If only because they're not outgrowing the competition, they're not growing faster in the online transaction space than say, Amazon is, which is continuing to take market share. I think that it was a good quarter, they've credited some of that to the current environment, pandemic, less mobility means more purchasing for them. I think they're probably getting a nice little boost from the various collectible markets that are certainly not a huge part of the business, but at the edges helping the transaction volumes. But it means you're seeing as much as you may see the stock market, you may see the bitcoin, you may see some things like GameStop and wonder how much of a bubble there is in certain equity and commodity markets, that's extended to a number of the collectible markets as well. I think that eBay benefits from that, at least in the short-term.
Hill: eBay is a sneakily rewarding stock. It's one of those businesses that to a degree is unfairly lumped in with let's just call it the past. It's like, eBay, well, that was great 20 years ago, that was a hot name but they missed the bow. They had PayPal and they spun it out, thank God for PayPal. If you look at a chart of eBay, it has been a steady performer over the last 20 years. For anyone who's held it for that amount of time, again, there are always more exciting names than eBay, but it has rewarded shareholders over the last 20 years.
Barker: Yes. I'll put some qualifications on that. The last 15 years have not been as good. It's up 6% annually over the last 15 years. Market's up 10%, Internet retail is up 24%. It's made a nice comeback in the last year being up 70% as a stock. That's done some work in making up the degree to which is trailing. But even eBay, 70%, Internet retail, the sector up 72% over the last year. It did a lot of great work early on. Stock price got a bit ahead of itself and maybe it's back on track now, certainly over the last year is showing that it's highly relevant. But one of the reasons why you might say it gets unfairly lumped in is the closest competition to it, which has been outperforming it over most time periods that you would measure over the last 15 years.
Hill: The stock of the day is Canada Goose Holdings. Global digital sales in the third quarter rose nearly 40%. Luxury parkas are in demand. Canada Goose mix them and shares of this stock are more than 25% today.
Barker: Did you get a chance to look at that link I sent you?
Hill: Very briefly. You sent me a link to the Canada Goose website where if I'm looking for luxury parkas, I could extensively do some shopping.
Barker: Yeah and not just luxury parkas. They've got masks. The mask that you wear outside these days for your health and the health of the others in your vicinity?
Hill: Yes.
Barker: What do you spend on that?
Hill: Not a lot of money.
Barker: Didn't go $125 for that mask?
Hill: [laughs] I did not spend $125 on a mask though.
Barker: Well, if you wanted to become the kind of person that spends $125 on a mask, you can be that person by shopping at Canada Goose. A great quarter for them. As they point out in their press release, they've still got a quarter of their retail stores closed right now, but they are doing a better job on the online direct-to-consumer sales. They are doing a great job in China. If you can get people to buy a $2,000 parka, a $125 mask, $200 toque, then you've got a heck of a business, and this quarter shows that they do have a brand and a quality of material. It's sort of a required wear on some college campuses. I think people will probably right now find, ""Hey, they want to spend more time outside."" They are able to spend more on good, comfortable, warm winter clothing because they're not spending it in other places. It's a great quarter for them, but I look at these prices and I wonder just how long they can sell how many of these things at these prices.
Hill: In their defense, they do also offer face masks for $75.
Barker: They do.
Hill: For people looking for more of a bargain option. Now, it is interesting to see, because we've certainly talked over the years about businesses that are going after the luxury market, Tiffany being the classic example, and how some businesses have gone astray because they had a luxury brand or somewhere on the luxury half of the spectrum. Then they started doing some discounting or going the route of outlet malls to boost sales, that sort of thing, and it hurt them in the end. If Canada Goose can keep this up, it's a big rise in the stock today. It's not close to where the all-time high of this stock is. But if they can get their fulfillment right, get their shipping right, then they become a global luxury brand.
Barker: Well, what about the $150 baseball cap? Can I interest you in that?
Hill: Only if it also comes with, I get an appearance, like on that documentary Will Ferrell, did where he was part of spring training. $150, does it give me like, ""Yeah. You get this inning, you get to play right field,"" something like that?
Barker: No, no. It gets you a hat.
Hill: No. I don't have that kind of coin. No.
Barker: Well, that's what they're doing. That's what they're achieving. They've got great margins on their sales and I think it's an upper 60% gross margin. They're a brand that is loved by a lot of people and the people who have the money to afford the brand were buying it last quarter. That's the news for Canada Goose. They can't get into all the stores they want to go to, but they are finding them online and particularly in China, I think they've got plenty of story left to play out there.
Hill: Quick programming note on this weekend's Motley Fool Money radio show, Chad Millman is our guest. He is the Chief Content Officer at The Action Network. We're talking about the state of sports betting in America, and Chad also has a few things to say on prop bets for the Super Bowl. Check that out on Motley Fool Money this weekend.
We'll wrap up with Grubhub. Fourth-quarter loss was bigger than expected. Grubhub is spending more on marketing, that explains part of it. The shares are only down about 3% and I'm assuming that's because this is not a stock that has shot to the moon over the last 12 months.
Barker: No. Well, they're being acquired and that was announced over the summer by a European entity, getting a foot into the U.S. So Just Eat Takeaway, which is a Netherlands based company with operations there, taking over Grubhub. Basically, there is a pretty solid floor because of the acquisition price for Grubhub, but it's all stock. So it's not a solid cash price. It looks like, Just Eat Takeaway's stock is also down about 3% on the basis of this report, in part. Grubhub has been losing market share to Uber Eats, losing market share to DoorDash, and you would have thought they were in the right place at the right time for this. The DoorDash competition has really been one of the things that has really, really hurt Grubhub over the last two years.
Hill: This week we also saw Uber Eats acquiring Drizly, which is the alcohol delivery service. So Uber is spending just over $1 billion to get Drizly and we'll see if the new parent company for Grubhub can right the ship in the United States. But this is not a close contest right now in terms of who is winning when it comes to either getting people from point A to point B or getting food from point A to point B. Grubhub is just getting lapped by the likes of DoorDash and as Uber makes more investments into this space, it only gets harder for them.
Barker: Yeah. The investments that they're making into advertisements are ones, I don't know if you've been seeing as many of these Uber Eats ads lately as I have, I think they've got Super Bowl ads coming up. Maybe with Wayne's World or is that the one that is campaigning for the Super Bowl?
Hill: Some food delivery, yeah, I think whether it's Grubhub or someone is doing Mike Myers and Dana Carvey. That should appeal to younger folks. Let's bring back the sketch comedy from Saturday Night Live of the early 1990s, that should resonate.
Barker: It's going to resonate with us because we are the ones who are lazier than the youth of today and ordering food more and have more money to spend on that. So yeah, I think that the market is more us than your children for that.
Hill: Good luck with that.
Barker: The Mark Hamill and Patrick Stewart ones?
Hill: Those are enjoyable.
Barker: Well, that's also aimed at us. I think Mark Hamill travels a little bit more into the youth with his appearances in the most recent Star Wars movies and the Mandalorian for that matter, spoiler alert. But I think that, at all levels, Uber Eats is major competition, well-funded, making a move to be more ubiquitous in people's minds, and I don't know what Grubhub and their new owners plan of counter attack is going to be, but it's not playing out very well just yet.
Hill: Bill Barker, always good talking to you. Thanks for being here.
Barker: Thanks for having me.
Hill: As always, people on the program may have interest in the stocks they talk about and The Motley Fool may have formal recommendations for or against, so don't buy or sell stocks based solely on what you hear. That's going to do it for this addition of MarketFoolery. This show is mixed by Dan Boyd. I'm Chris Hill, thanks for listening, we'll see you on Monday.

2021-02-10 00:00:00+00:00,Is eBay Stock a Buy?,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/is-ebay-stock-a-buy-2021-02-10,,,"eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY) stock has attracted few bidders in recent years. It traded in a range for years before Jamie Iannone took over as CEO in April. However, both a pandemic and a change in management have renewed interest in the consumer discretionary stock. This different approach could make eBay an overlooked comeback story in a fast-growth industry.
The eBay comeback
Despite the prosperity of e-commerce giants such as Amazon or Shopify, eBay had become a laggard in a fast-growing retail segment. High fees, a difficult-to-use platform, and free listing options such as Facebook's Marketplace made eBay an afterthought. It had fallen so far that its former subsidiary PayPal now supports a market cap nearly eight times as large.
Conditions began to change when Iannone, a former eBay executive, returned to the company in April 2020. Prior to his return, Iannone helped spearhead e-commerce strategies at Walmart eCommerce and Sam's Club. These successes helped lead eBay's board to bring him back.

Iannone's strategy
Admittedly, as he started, store closings amid the COVID-19 pandemic increased interest in e-commerce across the board. However, Iannone embraced several different strategies to improve both the buyer and seller experience on eBay.
Under his leadership, eBay reduced the number of steps in the listing process to make adding products less cumbersome. It also introduced QR coding to make pick-ups more efficient and focused on ""non-new in-season"" products to better utilize the existing buyer and seller communities.
eBay also introduced tools and features that better enable small businesses to grow their enterprises. The company has simplified registrations and enabled storefronts on mobile devices. Additionally, eBay utilized AI teams to remove ""points of friction."" One addition involved improved filtering to help customers find the items they want. Finally, as agreements with PayPal expire, eBay has added managed payments in several countries to foster a digital wallet experience. Many of these migrations have already taken place.
Iannone announced on the Q4 2020 earnings call that promoted listings grew 86% over the course of the year. He also added that eBay acquired 11 million new buyers in 2020, and the frequency and retention of these customers resembled pre-pandemic levels.
eBay's financials
Such improvements helped the top and bottom lines. In 2020, revenue increased by 19% to just under $10.3 billion. Also, GAAP net income from continuing operations rose to just over $2.5 billion, or $3.58 per share, up almost 68% from year-ago levels.
This increase occurred because operating expenses growing more slowly than revenue. Also, an investment in Adyen, a Dutch payments company in which eBay invests, brought in $709 million. This almost offset income taxes of $878 million. Additionally, these numbers do not include a one-time income boost of over $3.1 billion stemming from discontinued operations.
As for the future, the company believes the growth will continue in the near term. eBay projects revenue in the first quarter of 2021 will rise 35%-37%. It also expects between $0.81 and $0.86 per share in GAAP net income during this period, up from $0.64 the year before.
Given that optimism, it is little wonder eBay stock has increased by more than 60% since Iannone took over on April 27.
EBAY data by YCharts
Furthermore, even after that increase, investors who buy now will pay only about 18 times earnings from continuing operations for eBay stock. This appears cheap for a company reporting massive net income growth. Additionally, with global e-commerce expected to rise at a compound annual growth rate of just under 15% through 2027 according to Grand View Research, eBay's double-digit earnings increases could continue into the foreseeable future.
Should I buy eBay?
No doubt eBay has seen a significant turnaround in 2020. Iannone's strategy to make the platform more user-friendly for buyers and sellers alike may have added an additional revenue boost. Nonetheless, COVID-19 likely fueled a significant portion of that increase, so investors will probably have to see double-digit revenue and earnings growth continue after the pandemic to buy into an eBay comeback.
However, buying now means investors pay around 18 times earnings when both company and industry projections point to double-digit earnings increases. Should that value proposition remain in place after the pandemic ends, investors may continue bidding eBay higher.
