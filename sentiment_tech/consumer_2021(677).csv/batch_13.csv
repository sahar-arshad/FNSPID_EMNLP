Oct 28 (Reuters) - Wall Street's main indexes rose on Thursday as upbeat quarterly earnings from Caterpillar, Merck and Ford helped investors shrug off data that showed U.S. economic growth slowed sharply in the third quarter.
Ford Motor Co F.N jumped 11.2% after the carmaker topped third-quarter profit estimates and raised its full-year earnings forecast.
Caterpillar Inc CAT.N added 2.9% after reporting a quarterly profit on high commodity prices, while a quarterly beat and a forecast raise by drugmaker Merck & Co Inc MRK.N helped its shares gain 4.0%.
Ten of the 11 major S&P sectors advanced in early trading, with technology .SPLRCT and real estate .SPLRCR among the top gainers.
The Commerce Department's report showed the U.S. economy grew at a 2% annualized rate last quarter, as COVID-19 infections flared up, upending global supply chains and fueling labor and goods shortages.
Labor market conditions in the United States continued to improve, with the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits dropping to a fresh 19-month low last week.
""Slower growth in Q3 was the result of a normalization of spending activity and the significant bottlenecks that remained. There are signs of a better development in the fourth quarter,"" Bernd Weidensteiner, senior economist at Commerzbank said in a note.
""(The data) will not dissuade the Fed from deciding on a gradual end to its bond purchases next week, given the good situation on the labor market and increasing price risks.""
Stellar earnings reports have driven the benchmark S&P 500 .SPX index and the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI to record highs this week, while bringing the tech-heavy Nasdaq .IXIC to just 0.4% below its all-time peak hit on Sept. 7.
Profits for S&P 500 companies are expected to grow 37.6% year-on-year in the third quarter, up from an expected 29.4% rise at the start of the earnings season, according to data from Refinitiv.
Focus will also be on earnings reports from Apple Inc AAPL.O and e-commerce giant Amazon.com AMZN.O after market close on Thursday, wrapping up a largely upbeat reporting season for mega-cap technology stocks.
Shares of Apple rose 2.1% to provide the biggest boost to the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq, followed by gains in Tesla Inc TSLA.O.
At 10:06 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI was up 165.72 points, or 0.47%, at 35,656.41, the S&P 500 .SPX was up 27.49 points, or 0.60%, at 4,579.17, and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC was up 108.00 points, or 0.71%, at 15,343.83.
In the run-up to the Federal Reserve's policy meeting next week, market focus has also moved beyond pricing the likely taper of asset purchases this year and onto the timing of an interest rate hike next year.
Also on the radar, U.S. President Joe Biden will urge Democrats in Congress to back a new $1.75 trillion framework for economic and climate change spending.

Oct 28 (Reuters) - The Nasdaq hit a record high on Thursday, led by mega-cap companies Apple, Amazon.com and Tesla, while solid results from Caterpillar and Merck helped investors shrug off signs of slowing economic growth.
Ten of the 11 major S&P sectors advanced, with technology .SPLRCT hitting an all-time high and consumer discretionary .SPLRCD rising more than 1%.
Shares of Tesla Inc TSLA.O rose 3.4%. Apple AAPL.O and e-commerce giant Amazon.com AMZN.O gained 2.6% and 1.9%, respectively, ahead of their earnings reports later in the day that would wrap up a largely upbeat reporting season for Wall Street's tech titans.

Caterpillar Inc CAT.N added 3.2% after reporting a better-than-expected quarterly profit on rising commodity prices, while a forecast raise by drugmaker Merck & Co Inc MRK.N helped its shares gain 4.6%.
""We are still favorable on US equities and don't expect any near term reasons for the bullishness to fade which is led on by strong earnings,"" said James Gaul, portfolio manager at Knights of Columbus Asset Advisors.
""There are supply chain issues affecting short-term results but there is anticipation for strong demand and supply issues subsiding going ahead, and for all major sectors the long term is attractive.""
The Commerce Department's report showed the U.S. economy grew at a 2% annualized rate in the third quarter as COVID-19 infections flared up, while another set of data showed fewer Americans filed new claims for unemployment benefits last week.
""Slower growth in Q3 was the result of a normalization of spending activity and the significant bottlenecks that remained ... it will not dissuade the Fed from deciding on a gradual end to its bond purchases next week, given the good situation on the labor market and increasing price risks,"" Bernd Weidensteiner, senior economist at Commerzbank, said in a note.
Stellar earnings reports have driven the benchmark S&P 500 .SPX index and the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI to record highs this week, with analysts expecting profits for S&P 500 companies to grow 38.6% year-on-year in the third quarter.
At 11:57 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI was up 137.92 points, or 0.39%, at 35,628.61, the S&P 500 .SPX was up 33.32 points, or 0.73%, at 4,585.00, and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC was up 165.59 points, or 1.09%, at 15,401.42.
Tech and growth stocks also got a boost from a pullback in the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield US10YT=RR, which had hit its highest level since mid-May last week on inflation and rate-hike concerns. US/
President Joe Biden said he had secured a new $1.75 trillion framework for economic and climate change spending that could pass the Senate, and expressed confidence it would win the backing of all wings of the Democratic Party.
Among the biggest losers, EBay Inc EBAY.O fell 7.5% after the e-commerce firm forecast downbeat holiday-quarter revenue.

This video was recorded on Oct. 22, 2021.
Dylan Lewis: It's Friday, October 22nd, and we're talking Pinterest and PayPal. I'm your host, Dylan Lewis and I'm joined by fool.com's absurd appraiser of accidental acquisitions, Brian Feroldi. Brian, what is going on?
Brian Feroldi: Dylan, we got visited by not the news fairy this week, but by the rumor fairy this week [laughs] and that's what this shows about.
Dylan Lewis: I like to think of them as cousins, the news fairy and the rumor fairy. One slightly more reputable than the other.
Brian Feroldi: That's right. In some cases, given the size of the deal that we're about to discuss, more often than not, I found these rumors tend to be true.
Dylan Lewis: Usually don't get any movement on a company that big, unless there's some pretty solid reasons to back up the rumor. Of course, we are talking about the interest that PayPal has, the rumored late-stage talks that they have to acquire Pinterest. Brian, you were one of the first Fools to really put Pinterest on, I think the community's radar, as an interesting investment. It has proven to be a multi-bagger for people who followed some of those early looks that you gave. I know there are also some people like myself who have some positions that are currently down on the stock, you were the person I wanted to bring on to talk about this.
Brian Feroldi: Pinterest was my wife's, and still is, favorite business on Earth. She has been a user of this platform for years and knowing how often she used it and how often I've seen it in my daily life, I knew that there was a lot of value to this platform. The company has been a roller-coaster up and down. The long-term trajectory has been positive and the interest by PayPal at this stage of the game isn't all that shocking.
Dylan Lewis: We're going to get into strategically why this might be a good fit. The pros and cons of a deal like this and then also a little bit of just how investors should think about the stocks they own in their portfolio when they get acquired. But first, I think we need to just give a run down, Brian, on what we know so far. We are talking about rumors, there's a little bit of speculation here, so we have to give that caveat, but there have been some details that have leaked out.
Brian Feroldi: Yes. Earlier in the week, both Bloomberg and CNBC reported that PayPal was in late-stage talks to acquire Pinterest. While again, it's unconfirmed by either company at this stage of the grain, given the size of this potential deal, I would lean toward this being more true than not true. The deal terms that we know, ""know so far"", is that PayPal is roughly willing to pay $45 billion to acquire Pinterest, that values the company somewhere around $70 per share. This news broke on Wednesday, and that price represents a 27 percent premium to Tuesday's closing price. No surprise, Pinterest stock shot up the day that this deal was announced, about 13 percent, PayPal stock actually went down. As of the time of this taping, Pinterest market cap is about 39 billion. It's currently trading in the low 60s, so there is still a discount to the ""take-out price"".
Dylan Lewis: People will always look at that first-day movement after the announcement as an indication of the market's perception of a deal like this. I will say, before we even get too far down into the details, there's been a lot of times that acquirers have sold off on the news that they are buying somebody new, and they've turned out to be wonderful acquisitions. There are times where acquires have popped on news of acquisitions and they've proven to be terrible acquisition. You can only really read so much into the immediate reaction in the first-day news. I imagine, Brian, that most folks that have listened to the show for a while are probably fairly familiar with Pinterest, but I do want to bring people up to speed a little bit on what the most recent quarters looked like, particularly as we start to talk about how this strategically might fit in for PayPal.
Brian Feroldi: 2020 was a fabulous year for Pinterest with everybody in the globe stuck in their houses, demand absolutely skyrocketed. While initially Pinterest's results lagged because of the slowdown in marketing spend, the company really came back with a vengeance in the third and fourth quarter. As a result, its stock just went straight up and to the right. More recently we've seen a slowdown in the company's user base. In the second quarter, which is the most recent quarter, we have financials on. Top-line growth was still outstanding, 125 percent revenue growth showing that advertisers are still choosing this platform more often. However, the stock actually sold off when the earnings were announced. Reason for that is because of the monthly active users. While the total monthly active users were up about nine percent to 454 million, in the United States, monthly active users actually declined by about five percent to 291 million. Wall Street is a forward-looking machine, so the fact that monthly active users were declining really spooked some investors.
Dylan Lewis: I think it's helpful to lay in a little context, Brian, just on the lifeblood of a social media company, is going to be the users long-term just because that's the monetizable activity. There's a perfectly viable business, at least for the next couple of years, for a social media company, that is where Pinterest is, where they are bringing a lot of ad inventory onto the platform. But what Wall Street and what investors want to see is that they have the growth lever of bringing those ads on, and also a growing user base, particularly in the US and in North America, which is the most important ad market out there.
Brian Feroldi: Yeah, that's the one-two punch for this company. One of the reasons why I was so bullish on Pinterest and still I'm, it's just the fact that they are so under-monetized when compared to many of the other social platforms. In the most recent quarter, the average Pinterest user in United States generated about five dollars in revenue, compare that to a company like Facebook, which is in the 40s. More importantly, the international numbers are very under-monetized. The average user in international markets only generated 36 cents in revenue, again, if you look at a company like Facebook, it's many multiples higher than that. A big bull case for the company was that there was going to be modest growth in total users, however, there was so much room to grow on the monetization side that that was going to power the company's revenue.
Dylan Lewis: Let's talk a little bit just about how this fits into the strategic direction for a company like PayPal. Because similar to Pinterest, I think PayPal is one of those companies, we get lucky Brian, we don't have to give too much of an introduction on what they do, people are pretty familiar with it. You're going to be thinking about this primarily with online payments, peer-to-peer payments, they've increasingly made investments in the buy-now-pay-later space. But the constant thread with all of those is generally we're talking FinTech and we're talking payments is what this company owns.
Brian Feroldi: PayPal is on a mission to make itself into a super finance app, and essentially, anything that has to do with money and finance, PayPal wants to do. The company does have a history of throwing money around to make acquisitions. Just some recent, in the last couple of years, that it's made would be Braintree, Venmo, Xoom, iZettle, Honey, which was its biggest acquisition at four billion dollars, and more recently Paidy which was roughly three billion dollars. That's a lot of money that this company has thrown around. The idea behind tying up with Pinterest is an order of magnitude bigger than its biggest acquisition. This would be a super bet for the company. But you can understand some of the rationale. The CEO of PayPal has gone on record saying they want to essentially double the number of active users that the company has in its platform by 2025 to 750 million. Buying Pinterest would help them get there. There's also an argument made that there will be some tie-ins for the merchant side where you could say, ""Hey, you're already accepting our payments, have you thought about advertising to your customers? We can do so on one of the most popular social media platforms that also, by the way, has no negativity associated with it."" I think that's a big part of the rationale.
Dylan Lewis: You also see some strategic fit here with payments being the focus for a company like PayPal and Knowing that Pinterest is really the starting point for a lot of people making purchase decisions. Very often the inspiration moment or the vision board moment for people, whether it's a project in the home DIY space, recipes, anything like that, it starts with Pinterest and then they are taken elsewhere to transact. We think of Pinterest primarily as an ad play, it would not be far-fetched to think that under PayPal, there could be some merchant and more e-commerce functionality built into what that company does.
Brian Feroldi: Yeah, that's a great point, that's one of the primary reasons why I've been so bullish on Pinterest. People go to Pinterest because they want inspiration so they can take action in the real life. When we were redoing our kitchen two years ago, we were on Pinterest almost every day trying to find ideas, it's a very natural extension from going from, here's this idea that I have to, how can I buy that thing? That makes, to me, Pinterest an incredibly monetizable platform.
Dylan Lewis: One of the other things that I think is kind of interesting too, is you gave that rundown of some of the acquisitions that they've made recently. Some of those names are probably not super familiar to folks in the United States and that's because a lot of them operate or are based elsewhere. iZettle is a Swedish company, Xoom helps people send money, reload phones, and pay bills around the world, Paidy is buy-now-pay-later in Japan. One of the things that we have noticed looking at the user transfer for Pinterest is, international is one of the better performing segments for them, that's where a lot of the growth is happening, and the US is seen as a more mature market. You see PayPal making these international investments and you know that that's where the excitement is with user growth in Pinterest. I think there's probably something there too.
Brian Feroldi: That's worth double-clicking on. As of the most recent quarter, there were 91 million monthly active users in United States, but there were 363 million in international markets. While the growth in users was declining in United States, it was up double-digits in international markets. Management also did give some forward guidance for the third quarter on monthly active users, and they basically we're expecting more of the same, a decline in monthly active users in United States, but growth in international markets. That tie-in for international reach definitely makes sense.
Dylan Lewis: Brian, I am a shareholder of both of these companies. Are you a shareholder of both these companies?
Brian Feroldi: I am a shareholder of both of these companies, Dylan.
Dylan Lewis: [laughs] I think it is only healthy for us to also make the case here against this deal, and take a little bit of a critical view and just try to understand what could go wrong with something like this. I think the most obvious thing to me, Brian, with something like this is we know what PayPal does, PayPal knows what it does, and it does it really well; it is pretty specialized, pretty focused in the payment space. This is something that looks like a TAM expansion opportunity, it also means that they'd be moving further and further away from what their core competency is.
Brian Feroldi: They don't really have any experience running a company like Pinterest. All the other acquisitions that they've done have been small relative to their absolute size, which is absolutely gargantuan. I mentioned PayPal is currently a $285 billion company; it's huge. They don't necessarily have working knowledge of how to run a company like Pinterest. It also matters on how they would actually do it. We've seen time and time again, history clearly shows that most acquisition especially big ones do not work out, the companies fail to realize the ""synergies that are promised"". How PayPal and Pinterest would integrate with each other would really matter.
Dylan Lewis: I like that operational point that you mentioned with just running that type of business because while Pinterest is, what we think of as probably in the best light social media company out there right now, it's at least controversial, I think, of any of them, it is generally seen as a relatively safe space on the Internet. It is still a treasure trove of user-generated content, that means moderation. Who knows where the winds go with that kind of thing. That is just a little different than the monster that PayPal is used to managing.
Brian Feroldi: It certainly is. The other thing worth noting is one of the big reasons that I was so bullish on Pinterest is it was still founder-led. Ben Silbermann founded this company but was still running it. If indeed this acquisition goes through, would he want to stay on and essentially become an employee of PayPal? That's something that is not really attractive to a lot of founders. If he was to exit, stage left, that would certainly be culturally changing at Pinterest.
Dylan Lewis: One other thing I saw out there that I thought was interesting, Brian, I'd love for your take on this is PayPal for all intents and purposes right now, is relatively neutral in the online shopping space. They operate in this space where they're helping everyone facilitate transactions, they exist in competition with other payment facilitators, but they don't own any turf that they are trying to point people to. We've talked about this with the likes of Roku in the past. That can sometimes be a super advantageous position to be in.
Brian Feroldi: It really can. That is one of the major reasons that PayPal was spun off of eBay. That direct tie-in with eBay was keeping PayPal from winning business. After the split happened and it was truly a neutral party, that's one of the reasons that PayPal has seen such phenomenal adoption and growth. There is an argument to be made that tying in with one social media platform so directly could inhibit adoption.
Dylan Lewis: Just as an aside, Brian, the PayPal-eBay spinout is one of the classic, sometimes it's better to own the other one things, right? When you roll a company out from underneath another one, sometimes you're able to materialize value that you can't recognize when they're owned by that parent company. That is like the poster child for that. PayPal has been far and away the better business to own of those two.
Brian Feroldi: Yes, it's not even close and it just shows you how much value can be unlocked sometimes for spinouts.
Dylan Lewis: Yeah, you mentioned before 285 billion in value to be exact. PayPal is, I think one of those sneaky big companies. I think it's easy to be like, there's relatively young, how big they be? Hundreds of billions of dollars in market cap big, and so I think in the context of a company that size $45 billion acquisition, Brian, it's a sizable one. It is not necessarily a course altering one if you're looking at the overall value business. But I think if you start digging into the top-line for these companies to cash available on hand, it's a different story. It is a pretty impactful acquisition, if it goes through.
Brian Feroldi: PayPal would be paying a pretty healthy premium if the pricing is indeed real. Again, Pinterest is doing about two billion dollars in trailing 12-month revenue. That is about one-tenth of PayPal, which did about 24 billion, so a $45 billion take-out price would be a price-to-sales ratio of about 22. Again, it's really the comparison to the market caps of the two businesses that I always look at. At $45 billion acquisition, that would be about 15 percent of PayPal's current market cap. That is a huge number.
Dylan Lewis: Yeah. If you look at the balance sheet, PayPal currently has 12 billion in cash and equivalences, 9 billion in long-term debt, so you got to pay for an acquisition somehow. It's either going to be cash, it's going to be debt, or it's going to be shares. I think we can figure out which of the two it's most likely to be based on those numbers?
Brian Feroldi: Yes. It would almost have to be equity, or at least involve a sizable amount of equity. I can't imagine that the company would want to go and settle it's balance sheet with 30 or $40 billion in additional debt. That would make it look upside down. I'm guessing that equity would be a major part of that consideration.
Dylan Lewis: Brian, before we move onto the broader view on this and just how investors should be thinking about businesses that they own when they get acquired, and really what the to-do list is. I want to take a second and pause and say, we own both of these businesses. How are you looking at this acquisition? I guess we own either of them and both of them either way, are you rooting for this to go through?
Brian Feroldi: I'm of two minds about it, to be honest. In general, I don't like it when the companies that I own get bought out. A lot of people do because it's fun to see that one day pop when the share price goes up by a whole bunch. But I put so much time and effort into finding these companies research thing then doing everything upfront. When I finally bring a company into my portfolio, I essentially wanted to do all the growing and all the compounding for me. If the company comes in and swoops that away for me, that stealing away a major opportunity from me. So in this case, while I understand the rationale for the deal, I'm not exactly for rooting for it to go through.
Dylan Lewis: I think that's one of the tough parts about being a long-term investor sometimes, is the short-term pops can be exciting negative on news, but if you buy a business, and you're planning on holding it for 3, 5,10 years, you're probably looking at far bigger upside on your thesis than whatever that one day pop is going to be. You're hoping maybe for multi-bagger returns depending on the type of investor you are and types of businesses you own. That's certainly the case I have with Pinterest, where I have some positions on Pinterest that are actually down. I'm in the red on some of those. I will probably get close to breakeven with this take-out price, but I see this being a potentially much bigger company in five-years than this takeout prices can be giving me right now.
Brian Feroldi: That's a particularly precarious situation when you buy a stock, it gets bought out and you end up losing money on the deal, and that's worth noting here. Pinterest traded at almost $90 per share earlier in the year, so if that $70 ticket price, again does materialize, that means there's going to be a bunch of shareholders there that are going to see this company taken away from them at a loss.
Dylan Lewis: Yeah. You hate to see it. In this case, I'll be able to enjoy the upside because I'll be a PayPal shareholder. Whatever the terms of the deal, maybe I'll be paying attention to that. But I do think there is something to be said for a stand-alone Pinterest in the future, being a business that maybe gets to the size of some of the other social media giants out there. We do that ARPU comparison almost every single time we talked about them, Brian, and it seems like there's so much upside. The investor in me wants to be able to see that materialize.
Brian Feroldi: I'm right there with you. Now, on the scoop side, the news flow out of Pinterest recently has not been exactly positive. Not only that they report the slowdown in user growth as we saw, but more recently, Evan Sharp, one of the companies co-founders, decided to step away from the business and leave. That's not something that I like to see, and another news and other companies also been dealing with some acquisitions by former employees that the company was discriminating against female workers. When you combine all that together with the fact that the stock price has been weak recently, it's possible that Pinterest management team has just decided running a public company is not as much fun as it is to run a private one and they are looking for an exit.
Dylan Lewis: We talked about how these are rumors at this point, it's speculation at this point. There are instances of these types of talks materializing into something that seemed like it was going to happen. You don't have to look too far in the past, Zoom and Five9, I think, are a great example of this Brian, where it seems like a deal is going to happen, it got to the vote, and that didn't come through, it didn't happen. Even though the companies could be interested in, you have to have the investor's interest as well.
Brian Feroldi: There's still a lot of hurdles that a couple of I'd have to go through in order for this to actually happen, so both companies have to acknowledge it publicly, the official terms of the deals would have to go through, then there would be a shareholder vote that would have to go through. In this case, it would really boil down to what does Ben Silbermann want because he is the co-founder, he owns a sizable amount of stocks, so he could probably push the deal through on his own if he wanted to. But to your point, there are instances, recent instances when deals were announced, shareholders were onboard and yet it failed through because of either a vote or the company later changed it's mind. That's exactly what we saw happen with Zoom and Five9. Both companies agreed to it, both companies, boards agreed to it and yet shareholders of Five9 ended up voting it down. There's plenty of land mines ahead for the still to go through.
Dylan Lewis: Brian, our listeners know that you are a very checklist oriented person. You're very structured thinker when it comes to your investing framework. I know that you have a couple of different things that you look at when you're considering an acquisition, and whether it's ultimately good and also how to think about it as an investor. What are some of those questions, so we can pass those along to our listeners.
Brian Feroldi: This is a common question that people get when they own a company and the stock is going to get bought out. There are a number of questions, and I'd like to go through to say, should I sell now, should I wait, what are the odds of this happening? One question to ask is, can the acquirer afford the deal? In this case, we've been through the market caps of the two businesses and PayPal clearly could access to finance, it needs to make a deal happen. Another question I'd like to think about is, could there be any regulatory hurdles that could prevent this deal from going through? In this case, I doubt it, I doubt that there'll be any government blocking for saying PayPal can't acquire Pinterest. But if these two businesses are both huge giants in the payment industry, that would be a different story. For example, we're making this up, but if MasterCard and Visa were going to acquire each other, that would be a completely different regulatory headache. Another question I like to ask is, do I want to be an investor in the combined company if the deal goes through? I'm already investor in PayPal, I'm already an investor in Pinterest in this case, if the deal was made in stock, for example, my Pinterest stock will just get converted into PayPal stock, assuming it was an equity transaction. I will be more than OK with that because I'm still very bullish on PayPal's business. In other cases, if the acquirer is taking over a company, and you are not at all interested in the acquirer, then it can make sense to close out early. The final thing is just you really need to make sure that you understand the terms of the deal, is it going to be paid in all-cash? Is it going to be paid in all stock? Is it going to be a combination of the two? That is something that you have to think about.
Dylan Lewis: One thing I'll throw out there just for people that keep in mind for their own portfolio, and usually what will happen is we'll see the rumor mill run, we'll see the details get firmed up over the course of weeks or months, and then we if there's actually a deal, we'll know when that transaction date is going to be, and people wind up in the spot where they're saying, I could wait for this deal to close and enjoy the full acquisition price, or I can sell or move out of the position at a slight discount right now because they always have the pricing a little bit of risk just in case, and move on with my life, and what should I do here? I think if you're in the mindset of I don't want to be a shareholder in the acquiring company, one thing that often gets overlooked when people are looking at the stuff is just check your holding period for the company that you own. You want to make sure that you're not accidentally setting yourself up for short-term gains, if you are selling before the transaction period actually finishes, and it's just an easy box to check. Keep that in mind, we're generally thinking 3, 5,10 years, but you happen to have a position in a company that's a relatively short-term position, and they have to get bought. Just add that to the checklist, make sure it's on.
Brian Feroldi: Certainly. You do have to think about the taxes now if you own either of these stocks in an IRA or Roth IRA or 401(k), obviously, you don't have to really consider the tax situation, but if you want to in a taxable brokerage account, that is completely something that you need to think about. In this case, the deal, it hasn't been announced yet, but if the deal does get announced in the next couple of days, there's no way that it was going to be closing in 2021, it would easily close in 2022. In some cases, even if you want to sell and there will be a tax to doing so, it can make sense to wait to January to do so, so that where you're delaying those long-term taxes out until the following tax year. Taxes are definitely part of the equation.
Dylan Lewis: Brian, I think that's all I got on this one. I am glad that we were able to get together and talk about it. I'm bummed that this company that has been a great performer for a lot of Fools could possibly be taken out of the market because in part, I enjoy talking about it so much with you. It's a fun one to talk about, and I think the show is probably one of the first opportunities that it's really gone on Fools radar. Hopefully there will be more Pinterest shows to come. But either way, we will be talking PayPal. [laughs]
Brian Feroldi: Pinterest is definitely a fun one to talk about and I'm really glad we got this opportunity to talk about when acquisitions happen because it's happened to me many times in the past where companies that I've hold, have just gotten bought out, even though I didn't want them to and I guarantee it's going to happen in the future.
Dylan Lewis: It's a constant truth of the market. That's just the reality of it. It's validating in a way. It's Paypal saying, ""Hey, I like that thing that's in your portfolio. I think I might want it myself."" [laughs]
Brian Feroldi: It does suggest that you're onto something that you're stock-picking.
Dylan Lewis: Let's hope so. Brian, thank you as always for joining me.
Brian Feroldi: Thank you, Dylan.

Jamie Iannone -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Joe. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, I'll begin the call with key highlights from the third quarter. Then I will share some updates on the progress we are making toward our strategic vision. At the end of my remarks, I will turn the call over to Steve, who will discuss our financial performance and outlook in greater detail.
Q3 was another strong quarter, driven by our team's relentless focus on sellers and buyers. I'm excited by the positive impact this is having on the underlying health of the business. The changes we are making to the marketplace are improving results today and are also putting us in a better position to deliver sustainable growth. We remain confident in our long-term vision to grow the core, become the seller platform of choice and cultivate lifelong trusted relationships with buyers.
Let me highlight a few achievements from the quarter that brought us one step closer to this vision.
Our business delivered better-than-expected revenue and earnings growth on the high end of our guidance. Our strategic playbook continues to improve customer satisfaction and build trust and is leading to faster GMV growth in our focus categories. The managed payments migration, which is nearly complete, is helping sellers and buyers by reducing friction, lowering cost and enabling new capabilities. Our advertising business continues to grow faster than marketplace volume, and our product innovation provides sellers new tools to help them scale their eBay businesses.
We are also making great strides in our ESG efforts. Recently, we received approval from the science-based targets initiative for our multiyear carbon emission reduction goals. And importantly, we announced that eBay will be 100% carbon neutral this year and will remain so going forward.
I'm pleased to report that all key business metrics either met or surpassed our expectations in Q3. Revenue overperformed growing 10%, driven by acceleration in the payments migration and Promoted Listings growth. We also delivered $0.90 of non-GAAP EPS, at the high end of expectations, while increasing technology investments.
GMV performed in line with expectations globally, declining 12% versus last year and increasing 9% compared to 2019. Excluding transitory macro impacts, we continue to see modestly positive underlying growth in the business.
Global active sellers remained unchanged at 19 million, and total active buyers were 154 million. Over the past year, we have focused on attracting and retaining high-value buyers by innovating in focused categories and targeting enthusiasts with upper funnel marketing. We have also discontinued legacy couponing that's skewed toward low-value buyers. These actions are resulting in a gradual evolution of our buyer base over time. Compared to the third quarter of 2019, high-value buyers are up 6%.
Another ongoing transformation of our marketplace is managed payments, which progressed quickly during the quarter. In Q3, we processed over 90% of on-platform GMV and remain on track to finish by the end of this year. I'm thrilled that we are close to migrating all of our global sellers to a next-gen product experience. While we are close to completing the transition, we are only at the beginning of realizing our full payments potential. Owning the entire seller and buyer journey unlocks opportunities to remove friction, improve trust and provide new capabilities to sellers and buyers. We are already starting down this path, and here are a few examples.
Last quarter, we effectively eliminated unpaid items on fixed-price transactions and have continued to reduce this issue for best offers. In the U.K., we are paying many sellers as quickly as next business day after buyer payment is confirmed. Based on community feedback, we reduced another pain point for trusted sellers by increasing protection against fraudulent returns by requiring photos and providing return shipping credits.
In addition, we continue to improve our stores experience to make eBay the seller platform of choice. We've been increasing our traffic to stores and providing more CRM capabilities to make managing their businesses on eBay easier than ever. Sellers are leveraging these new features to drive repeat purchases. For example, in only six months since launch, more than 2.5 million buyers have completed a repeat purchase from a store using our new seller funded coupons. To further build sellers brands, we are testing video integration on high-traffic pages to help them tell their unique and compelling stories to enthusiast buyers.
Our advertising revenue continues to outpace volume due to Promoted Listings, which drove over $207 million in revenue in Q3, up 9%. We also tested three new Promoted Listings products and are starting to offer these features to more sellers.
In September, we opened up Promoted Listings Express to more sellers in the U.S., U.K., Germany and Australia. This feature allows sellers to boost visibility of auction listings for a onetime fee regardless of whether the item is sold. Early adopters have seen substantial growth in impressions and clicks.
Last month, we invited eligible sellers to try Promoted Listings Advanced, enabling them to create campaigns on a cost-per-click basis with more budget control. In parallel, we launched a suite of tools to create campaigns, monitor performance and optimize returns. We are also providing training and webinars to drive trial and adoption. During Q3, we explored ways to syndicate ads off eBay through external Promoted Listings.
Through the eBay Partner Network, we are testing tools and incentives for affiliates to drive enthusiast buyers to existing promoted listing sellers. We are also experimenting with other forms of seller-funded marketing across various channels. Our new advertising products are in the early days, and we are excited about their long-term potential.
Moving to our focus categories. I'm pleased with the pace of innovation and the positive reaction from our sellers and buyers. Volume from these categories continues to outperform the rest of the marketplace, and we are increasing customer satisfaction by improving trust.
As you may recall, when we exited last quarter, we had applied our playbook to approximately 10% of global GMV. We remain on track to expand that to roughly 20% by the end of the year. Let me walk you through several examples.
Our sneakers business in the U.S. continues to grow at healthy double-digit rates. During Q3, we launched authentication in Germany, added 30 more brands to our catalog and improved SEO performance for top sneaker brands. We also leaned further into upper funnel marketing and sponsored key industry events to strengthen our reputation with enthusiasts.
Starting tomorrow, we will be trialing a new 3D image capability on select sneaker listings. Leveraging AI and machine learning, the experience will allow buyers to interact with a detailed 360-degree view of the actual item they are buying. We're excited about the potential of this new technology, particularly the ability to reinforce buyer confidence at the point of purchase.
Moving to luxury watches. This category is also growing at strong double-digit rates in the U.S. Buyers are finding more inventory on eBay than other marketplaces as many brands have decreased production, and preowned supply is limited on other platforms.
Since launching authentication in luxury handbags, growth has accelerated in this category and was positive in Q3, outperforming the total U.S. site by double digits. We are seeing the same high customer satisfaction as other authenticated categories.
As I've mentioned in the past, part of our strategy is to drive enthusiasts to new trusted experiences and then leverage those buyers across our vast supply in other categories. The average buyer who purchases sneakers and luxury watches spends approximately $2,000 and $8,000, respectively, in other categories. We are seeing the exact same behavior in our latest focus category.
Buyers of authenticated handbags are spending over $5,000 outside of handbags. This cross-category benefit for sellers and buyers is a unique advantage for eBay. One of the reasons our growth has improved in luxury categories is the improvement in buyer and seller trust. We recently celebrated the one-year anniversary of authenticity guarantee, having now processed over 1.4 million items across multiple categories. Customer satisfaction has consistently exceeded 90%, and we are operating in five countries with a mix of in-house and third-party resources.
Another focus category that is driving growth in the U.S. is trading cards, which is growing significantly faster than the total marketplace. In late July, we launched new features, including price guides and collections, which allow trading card enthusiasts to view, manage and track the value of their portfolios. To date, close to 4 million cards have been added to customer collections. In addition, close to 250,000 buyers have used eBay's newly launched price guide to visualize the changing value of their favorite trading cards. These features cater to the needs of high-value enthusiasts and are increasing engagement and trust in eBay.
The next focus category we're applying the innovation playbook to is motors, parts and accessories. Among the changes we are making is to take our entire parts inventory and add it to the eBay Motors app, creating a one-stop shop for vehicles and parts enthusiasts. We are excited by the potential of bringing together one of the world's largest vehicle selections with hundreds of millions of parts in one customized experience. We're exploring further changes to parts and accessories that leverage our strong market position to capture more untapped growth.
ESG remains critical to our business health and to our customers, and I'm pleased to announce that we have reached some significant milestones in our journey toward establishing eBay as the leading sustainability company in e-commerce.
Just two weeks ago, we announced that our emission reduction goals were approved by the Science Based Targets initiative. We will reduce Scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions by 90% by 2030. This is the most ambitious designation available and aligned with the Paris agreement.
Additionally, we will reduce value chain emissions from downstream transportation by 20% in the same time frame. To reduce emissions from good shift using our platform, we will partner with our logistics providers to encourage low-carbon alternatives. I'm also proud that eBay will be carbon neutral for our offices and data centers in 2021. We expect to maintain this going forward as we continue efforts to reduce our overall carbon footprint.
At eBay, one of our core values is to be for everyone. As part of this focus, supporting our seller community is critically important. Earlier this month, we issued a new report on equitable entrepreneurship, which detailed how selling on eBay helped women during the pandemic. We found that 82% of women who are new to eBay or increased their selling did so because of job loss, reduction of income, illness, loss of child care or some other hardship. This vast majority of women surveyed says the ability to sell on eBay was a benefit during the pandemic, citing the need to earn additional income for themselves or drive revenue for their businesses. I'm proud that our platform can provide flexibility and opportunity to so many during tough times so that they can earn extra income through selling in our marketplace.
I'm also inspired by the continuous generosity of sellers and buyers on eBay. During Q3, approximately $35 million was raised through eBay for Charity, up 11%. Additionally, thousands of global employees helped select small businesses to receive grants totaling $3 million from the eBay Foundation. These grants are focused on serving underrepresented entrepreneurs and are used to provide training, coaching and mentorship needed to help their businesses thrive.
In closing, as I mentioned at the start of the call, Q3 was yet another strong quarter. We continue to make progress on our multiyear journey, and it's clear that our strategy is working. Enthusiasts are responding to innovation in our focus categories and are increasingly putting their trust in eBay.
Managed payments is on track to complete the migration this year and is driving friction out of the experience while opening up new capabilities for sellers and buyers.
Our advertising business is innovating by providing a portfolio of tools our sellers can leverage to build and grow their businesses on eBay. And we're accomplishing all of this while setting and achieving ambitious climate goals and providing a platform where economic opportunity is available to all.
I want to thank our passionate employees who have tirelessly worked to bring our vision and purpose to life. Their dedication to serving sellers and buyers is inspiring. Their relentless execution is driving innovation and making eBay a better marketplace, and I couldn't be prouder to lead this team.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Steve to provide more details on our financial performance. Steve, over to you.
Steve Priest -- Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer
Thank you, Jamie, and thank you all for joining us today. I'll begin with our Q3 financial highlights on Slide 4 of our presentation. We delivered another strong quarter. Our results met or exceeded expectations across all key metrics, while our year-over-year comparisons reflect the extraordinary growth we experienced last year as a result of the pandemic. These results were underpinned by continued execution against our strategic pillars, including contributions from payments, Promoted Listings and focus categories.
Revenue grew 10% year-over-year on an FX-neutral basis. The transaction revenue grew by double digits for the sixth consecutive quarter, primarily due to contributions from managed payments.
Non-GAAP EPS was $0.90 per share, and our operating margin was 31.7%. We generated $502 million of free cash flow and returned approximately $2.4 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and cash dividends during Q3. Given the underlying growth in our business and strong free cash flow generation, I'm pleased to announce we've raised our share buyback target for 2021 from $5 billion to $7 billion.
Our pending portfolio transactions remain on track to close within previously communicated time lines. We anticipate the sale of Adevinta shares to Permira will close during Q4, while the Korea deal, which will close early next year or potentially by the end of 2021.
Turning to active buyers on Slide 5. We exited Q3 with 154 million active buyers on a trailing 12-month basis, representing a 5% decrease year-over-year. This decline was primarily driven by low-value buyers, a group that makes up more than half of our buyer base but only 5% of GMV. As Jamie mentioned, this ongoing trend is a result of our strategy to prioritize attracting and retaining high-value buyers. We are confident in this approach, but we recognize the reduction in low-value buyers could pressure our rolling 12-month active buy account in the coming quarters. Compared with Q3 of 2019, a low-value buyers are down 7%, while high-value buyers were up 6%.
Moving to GMV on Slide 6. In Q3, we delivered $19.5 billion of GMV, down 10% year-over-year on a spot basis and down 12% on an FX-neutral basis, in line with our expectations. The macro benefits to our business from mobility was significantly diminished in Q3 as restrictions faded across the globe, where we continue to see modestly positive underlying growth in our business. Compared with Q3 of 2019, GMV grew 9% on an FX-neutral basis. Consistent with prior quarters, our performance by market varied based on a number of factors, including relative mobility and country-specific macroeconomic trends.
Internationally, GMV was roughly flat versus Q3 of 2019 on an FX-neutral basis. A number of factors influenced the growth differential between the U.S. and our international markets during the quarter. Mobility is back to pre-COVID levels in many of our largest international markets, diminishing the volume tailwinds we benefited from in prior quarters. Changing consumer behavior, including an uptick in leisure activities and travel, also may have impacted e-commerce growth internationally.
Additionally, category mix varies in our international markets, which have lower exposure to certain fast-growing verticals like collectibles, but higher concentration of items from cross-border trade that are more difficult to source amid the ongoing supply chain disruptions.
Finally, our focus category rollouts are more nascent in our international markets. However, as our innovation playbook expands to more categories and countries, we are confident our international growth trajectory will improve.
In the U.S., GMV grew 22% versus Q3 of 2019. Growth in our domestic marketplace was driven by strong execution against our strategic pillars, more product rollouts within focus categories and steady growth within e-commerce.
Residential mobility improved in the U.S. but continues to trial the European markets, while leisure activities and travel increased in line with normal seasonal trends. Other external factors may be benefiting our U.S. business relative to international markets, including the lingering impact of government stimulus and scarcity benefits and supply chain disruptions. The precise impact of these effects is unclear, but they are likely a net positive contributor to U.S. growth in the near term. In aggregate, there are numerous puts and takes between regions, but we remain encouraged by the modestly positive underlying growth in our business.
Turning to revenue on Slide 7. Net revenue for Q3 was $2.5 billion, up 10% year-over-year on an FX-neutral basis and 11% on a spot basis. We delivered $2.4 billion of transaction revenue, also up 11% on an FX-neutral basis. Growth was primarily driven by managed payments, which contributed roughly 20 points of incremental revenue growth during the third quarter. The payments ramp drove an 80 basis point sequential increase in our take rate, which surpassed 12% in Q3.
Moving forward, we expect our sequential take rate increases to moderate as the managed payments rollout is nearly complete.
Within our advertising business, Promoted Listings grew 9% year-over-year, outpacing volume by 21 points. Early adopters of the new Promoted Listings products are seeing significant increases in performance, giving us confidence in the long-term potential for advertising revenue.
Marketing services and other revenue declined 7% year-over-year to $151 million, driven by the impact of sold item declines and shipping programs and headwinds within third-party advertising. We continue to purposely reduce third-party advertising in favor of Promoted Listings, which delivers superior performance and offer a better experience for both sellers and buyers.
Moving to expenses on Slide 8. In Q3, we delivered non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 31.7%. This represents the 2.7 point year-over-year decrease primarily driven by lower volume. Our cost of revenue has scaled in line with payments growth due to variable processing costs. This dynamic has pressured gross margins during our transition to managed payments. However, once the transition is complete, we expect gross margins to be more stable. Moreover, the incremental revenue from payments drive significant leverage in our fixed expenses, most notably sales and marketing and G&A.
Sales and marketing fell by nearly 4 points as a percentage of revenue year-over-year in Q3. In addition to leverage from payments revenue, sales and marketing was lower due to reduction in coupons and rewards programs that were previously targeted toward low-value buyers.
Product development increased 21% year-over-year as we continue to accelerate product innovation and support our longer-term strategic initiatives within payments, advertising and focus categories. Transaction losses rose as a percentage of revenue by nearly 2 points versus last year due to higher consumer protection losses from the payments transition and the lapping of onetime benefits in the prior year, which were partially offset by the benefits of fee netting.
Turning to EPS on Slide 9. We delivered $0.90 of non-GAAP EPS in Q3, up 9% year-over-year as ramping contributions from payments and the net benefit of share repurchases more than offset the lapping of COVID-driven volumes a year ago. GAAP EPS for the quarter was $0.43, roughly 50% lower than last year. The delta was primarily driven by a fair value adjustment on our Adevinta shares, partly offset by gains from other investments.
Switching to free cash flow on Slide 10. We delivered another strong quarter of cash generation in Q3 with $502 million of free cash flow, a 4% decline year-over-year. The decline was driven by the timing of working capital and CapEx spend, partly offset by operational efficiencies and the timing of 2020 cash taxes.
As a reminder, the managed payments transition has yielded meaningful working capital benefits. Through three quarters of 2021, this benefit amounted to approximately $300 million.
Moving to capital allocation on Slide 11. We ended the quarter with cash and nonequity investments of $5.1 billion and gross debt of $9.1 billion. During the third quarter, we returned approximately $2.4 billion to our shareholders through stock repurchase and dividends. We repurchased approximately 31 million shares to $2.3 billion at an average share price of $72.52. We also paid a quarterly dividend of $116 million in September.
Given our fortress balance sheet and strong underlying free cash flow, we are updating our share buyback plan for 2021 from $5 billion to $7 billion, which implies approximately $3 billion of repurchases during the fourth quarter.
Overall, our capital allocation objectives remain unchanged. We'll preserve financial flexibility to execute on strategy and drive long-term value creation. We aim to drive organic growth in our business, and we'll look for opportunities to supplement that growth with disciplined acquisitions and investments. We will optimize our financial flexibility, access to debt and cost of capital, and we'll continue to deliver meaningful returns to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.
Moving to investments on Slide 12. As a reminder, we received 540 million shares in Adevinta from our Classifieds sale, which closed during June of this year, representing an equity ownership stake of approximately 44%. As a regulatory condition of the Classifieds sale, we committed to reduce our ownership stake in Adevinta to 33% or less over the 18 months following the close of the deal. In July, we agreed to sell approximately 135 million shares to Permira for roughly $2.4 billion. We believe the Permira share sale remains on track to close during Q4, and the 405 million shares that we would retain were worth close to $7 billion at the end of September.
Turning to Adient. The warrants we acquired in connection with our strategic partnership during the second quarter of 2018 were valued at $1.4 billion at the end of Q3, an increase of over $300 million quarter-over-quarter. You will find more information on the Adyen warrant in our 10-Q. Our stake in Kakao Bank has appreciated in value following the company's IPO in August. At the end of Q3, our investment was worth approximately $800 million.
Finally, in June, we announced plans to sell over 80% of our Korea business to eMark for approximately $3 billion. Upon deal close, we will retain an interest of just under 20% of eBay Career, which carried an implied value of roughly $800 million at the time of the announcement. We believe the deal remains on track to close by early 2022 with a possibility of closing before the year end. We remain excited about our portfolio of global investments, the potential optionality they provide and the significant value they collectively represent for eBay shareholders.
Turning to guidance on Slide 13. For the fourth quarter, we are projecting revenue between $2.57 billion and $2.62 billion, representing growth of 3% to 5% on an FX-neutral basis and approximately 4% to 6% on a spot basis.
Our pay rate has risen notably in recent quarters due to contributions from payments and advertising. Although we expect advertising to continue growing faster than volume, we expect the impact from payments on our take rate to moderate as we are nearing completion of our managed payments transition.
We are raising our 2021 full year outlook for payments revenue from $1.8 billion to $2 billion. Our revenue guidance implies GMV is down low teens on an FX-neutral basis versus last year and up mid- to high single digits compared to Q4 of 2019. Our GMV guidance assumes steady execution against our strategic pillars and continued innovation within focused categories. Our outlook also assumes minimal benefits from macro factors like mobility, stimulus and supply chain impacts. However, we note the macro environment remains dynamic and difficult to predict, with varied impacts from country to country.
We expect non-GAAP EPS of $0.97 to $1.01 per share in Q4, representing a 14% to 19% year-over-year growth. We plan to continue investing in product and technology to deliver better category experiences and improved customer satisfaction. We anticipate our non-GAAP tax rate to between 18% and 19% due to recent outperformance of our U.S. business. We expect our GAAP EPS in the range of $0.72 to $0.76 per share in Q4.
In closing, we delivered strong results in Q3 that met or exceeded their expectations across all key metrics. We continue to execute our strategic vision and grow our core marketplace while maintaining the balance and discipline that will enable us to generate tremendous value for our shareholders for years to come.
Managed payments is on track to deliver $2 billion in revenue this year. and our transition is on track for completion by year-end. However, we believe our payments journey is just beginning as this milestone unlocks new opportunities to reduce friction in the marketplace and provide additional financial services.
Advertising revenue continues to outpace volume, the sellers increasingly leverage our expanded product portfolio to amplify the exposure of their listings. We observed impressive momentum with our focus categories, which are meaningfully outpacing overall volume growth. We are confident we can continue expanding this innovation playbook to more categories and countries in the quarters ahead.
Our balanced approach to capital allocation has enabled us to reinvest in our business, generating consistently strong free cash flow and deliver attractive returns for shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.
As proud as I am of our numerous business accomplishments, what makes them even more impactful to me is knowing we are achieving these milestones while building sustainable, exclusive and circular economy platform for all.
Once again, I'd like to take this opportunity to thank our teams across eBay for their incredible work over the last quarter and their support for our amazing sellers and buyers in the eBay community.
One final note, we are in the midst of a multiyear journey to deliver a tech-led reimagination of eBay. As the impact from macro factors stabilizes, we are reviewing our internal goals for 2022 and beyond. We anticipate showing our longer-term goals and aspirations at an investor event early next year.
With that, Jamie and I will now take your questions. Operator, over to you.
Questions and Answers:
Operator
[Operator Instructions] We have our first question coming from the line of Edward Yruma with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Edward Yruma -- Analyst
Hey. Good afternoon, guys, and thanks for taking the question. I really wanted to click down a little bit on some of the categories that you're reimagining and some of the success you're noting there. Just help us understand maybe the new customers you're growing into the platform. I know you've identified some dollar amount, but just to clarify, are those new customers? Or is that customers that are participating in those categories? And then as a follow-up, what are the marketing plans to encourage new customer growth in these categories that you reimagined? Thank you.
Jamie Iannone -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yes. So I'll take that. So first, on the categories, it really is about both leading into the high-value buyers that are on the platform as well as attracting new buyers in. So if you look at what we're doing in watches and sneakers or this quarter, we announced we're authenticating handbags over $500, it is catering to both. One of the great benefits of eBay is the cross-category nature of shopping. So if we acquire a buyer into a handbag, who buys a handbag over $500, they actually end up spending $5,000 in other categories outside of handbags on the site. So when we think about acquisition, it's not just acquiring it for that category, it's acquiring it more broadly for eBay. That's one of our significant benefits.
Excited because we've expanded categories this quarter. We brought our sneakers authentication program to Germany. We brought watches to the U.K. business, and we launched handbags in the U.S. in terms of that product. From Certified Refurbished, we added new brands, Samsung, KitchenAid Dyson and expanded number of products there, and that's exciting coming into holiday.
On your question on marketing, we've really shifted our marketing. I think traditionally, we've been a mostly lower funnel with some broad-based campaigns on upper funnel really driving into how do we acquire high-value buyers and high-value enthusiasts in specific verticals. So what that means is a whole lot more of upper-funnel marketing, partnerships, leaning in with social media influencers in certain categories and basically going much more broad with our marketing plans to find those buyers where they are.
And I guess the last thing I'd say is we're really focused on the first 90-day experience on eBay. Many times in my career, I've done this, where you really get focused on how do you introduce them to the brand, bring them up the life cycle, make sure that they turn into the high-value buyers that we want to do, and that's going to be a continued focus for us over the coming quarters.
Edward Yruma -- Analyst
Great. Thanks so much.
Operator
We have our next question coming from the line of Colin Sebastian with Baird. Your line is open.
Colin Sebastian -- Baird -- Analyst
Jamie, maybe first on the core marketplace improvements. You obviously focused a lot on category-specific changes, and that's working well. How much effort is there in platformwide enhancements? And if there are any sort of specific initiatives there, what will be the timing for those? And then, Steve, maybe with respect to the Q4 outlook, just looking at the sequential ramp versus typical seasonality, it's certainly a little light of historical patterns even when eBay could be a net beneficiary from supply chain issues. I know you like factoring that into the outlook, but maybe some additional color there would be helpful. Thanks.
Jamie Iannone -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yes. So thanks for the question, Colin. So we do talk a lot about the vertical expansion and focus category work that we're doing, and we're excited for what's happening there. if you actually step back and look at it, the vast majority of our resources are actually going to sitewide initiatives across the board. And I'd point to a couple. One is, obviously, our ad business and a lot of investment there across the board, especially with the three new products that were at the beginning of launching. Obviously, payments huge initiative. But other areas that we haven't talked a lot about are like eBay stores. So working on a next-gen experience in eBay stores, incorporating video so allowing sellers to kind of tell their story from that perspective.
So the more CRM tool capabilities so that sellers can be more involved in how we bring buyers back to the platform and drive that repeat business. So the stat, I just mentioned earlier about we launched it six months ago, but now sellers are funding the coupons to drive buyers back to the site from passed buyers or interested buyers. And that's a huge benefit for sellers and a huge benefit for eBay because we're involving them and driving them and already 2.5 million buyers have used that in that time period.
So we're also testing a new selling experience. If you're on the site, you'll see that there's a beta out there of a new way to sell. So most of the vast majority of investments are going to horizontal. But what I like is it's a complement because some of those horizontal lean into some of the vertical work that we're doing in the vertical work, and we're able to use in a number of categories across the site. So the two also play together well.
Steve, I'll let you take the second part of the question.
Steve Priest -- Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer
Yes. Thank you, Jamie. Colin, I will say we're expecting a steady contribution from the strategic initiatives that Jamie has continued to lay out with the innovation that we're driving across the platform, not only in the focus categories, but also the momentum, so payments analysis going forward. On a year-over-two basis, I mean, if you think about and stand back year-over-year, we're obviously lapping the pandemic. On a year-over-two basis, we're seeing mid- to high single-digit growth compared to Q4 2019.
I think there's a few puts and takes, Colin. First of all, our holiday perspective around Q4 is embedded in the guide. From a headwind perspective, in the prepared comments we had, we talked about supply chain pressure for cross-border trade that we see on one side. But in terms of tail wind, obviously eBay is well-known for unique and scarce items, which we expect some supports through the holiday period. So a few puts and takes but overall, I'm pleased of what we believe will be continued modestly positive growth and driving growth on the platform as a result of the initiatives that we're driving forward.
Colin Sebastian -- Baird -- Analyst
Okay. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. We have our next question coming from the line of Deepak Mathivanan with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.
Deepak Mathivanan -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst
Great. Thanks for taking the question. Just two quick ones. First, can you elaborate on the new Promoted Listings offerings? I mean, should we expect these offerings to drive adoption among a broader range of sellers? And maybe related to that, can you provide an update on where you currently are in terms of penetration among the seller base for promoted offerings? And then a second question, I realize this might be a little bit early, but how should we think about the buybacks for next year? It feels like you have plenty of capacity, but wondering if there is a formula you're thinking about to do it in a more programmatic way after the $7 billion this year. Thank you.
Jamie Iannone -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yes. So on the new Promoted Listings offerings, let me just kind of explain this in detail. So the first one, which is Express is really to give us a Promoted Listings product against auctions so since we launched this product five years ago, it's really only applied to fixed price. And so this opens up, while a smaller format of the site, a format that has not been open to advertising before. Promoted Listings Express is a CPC-based product, gives sellers the opportunity to drive more velocity, goes after a different type of marketing budget for that perspective and gives us the opportunity to work with a secondary and supplementary advertising format. And the third is off-eBay advertising. And that's using the vast marketing reach that eBay does today, partnering with our sellers to drive advertising as part of that off-eBay outreach to bring existing buyers and new buyers back to the platform.
What I would say to you is that it's early days on these three products. If you look back, we start our ad business five years ago and we've grown to a $1 billion now over five years. And so we're at the point now where we're testing, we're learning. We've got invited sellers into the program. And just like it took us time to build up the CPA-based program, I think it will take us time here to build up the advertising program.
In terms of penetration, we still have a lot of opportunity left, both in terms of the sellers and listings. I believe the last that we shared was that only 400 million of the listings have advertising associated with them. So there's a lot of opportunity for additional penetration.
I'll let Steve take the second question about how we're thinking about the future.
Steve Priest -- Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer
Hi, Deepak. So I'm not going to go ahead myself for 2022. We haven't put the guidance out there, but I'll give us a little bit of color in terms of where we are. So as we've previously said, reinvestments in the business is our first priority, whether that's build, buy or partner. Having said that, beyond that, any excess cash that we do have continued to drive returns, we will continue with a disciplined return of capital to shareholders. And this is no different than the past. You had a strong and consistent history of actually doing capital return. And in 2021 has been no exception. So think about as going from $2 billion at the start of the year, listing up to $5 billion and most recently on this call talking about $7 billion. So I think when I stand back and about eBay as a whole, the balance that we have and the benefits of the franchise is we often have the ability to do both in terms of reinvesting in the business and doing capital returns to our shareholders. So you should expect that philosophy as we go forward.
Deepak Mathivanan -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst
Got it. Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator
We have our next question coming from the line of Ross Sandler with Barclays. Your line is open.
Ross Sandler -- Barclays -- Analyst
Hey, guys. Two questions, one on just U.S. versus international. So it seems like a big reason why your U.S. GMV is way above 3Q '19. I think you said it was like 23 or something like that compared to international is a little bit on the IST comp, but also from these focus category initiatives. So what's holding back the same type of uptick for international? Is it structural? Or is it just a timing thing that we should see a ramp up after you kind of roll those out after starting in the U.S.?
And then the second question is on how big is eBay Motors these days? I know it's a big category historically. And just can you talk about a little bit about the opportunity there in terms of making that one focus category and merging the parts and the motors.
Jamie Iannone -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yes. So let me start with the U.S. versus international. First off, let me say, I'm really pleased with the momentum we're seeing in the overall business. We're growing at 9% year-over-two-year basis based on the strategic vision we have. Clearly, different dynamics across the market. So in Q3, our international business was impacted by mobility returning to really pre-COVID levels, coupled with an unprecedented snapback in travel and leisure activities in Europe. In addition, as Steve mentioned a little bit earlier, our international cross-border trade sellers were also pressured by supply chain disruptions. That tends to be more in our international segment from a cross-border perspective than in our U.S. segment.
On the other hand, in the U.S., we've seen strong growth driven by momentum in our core business. To your question on the focus categories, it's not a structural change. We actually think the work we're doing applies across the whole globe. It's really a timing thing. So in most of these areas, we actually roll them out in the U.S., get them perfected here and then expand them internationally.
So for example, sneakers is just now launching this quarter in Germany. We launched watches in the U.S. We just started that expansion in the U.K. this quarter. Handbags, we just launched in the U.S. and that hasn't expanded yet. So it's really a timing thing, but we think the playbook that we have is relevant in every single market that we have. Probably with the exception of trading cards and collectibles, that's just so much stronger in the U.S. than it is internationally. But that's a huge U.S. benefit and a lot of the pieces that we're doing there are a key focus for that. But overall, I feel great about the health of the business and our ability to expand those focus categories internationally.
On your second question on P&A, we haven't disclosed the size of the business, but I will say that if you just step back and look at the market, we're in a leading position in P&A, especially in U.K. and in Germany. It's a very strong category and a very strong franchise there. And it's a key part of our path that we talked about last quarter of going from 10% of the site to 20% of the site. It's a strong category for eBay because of the vastness of parts and accessories that we have. We actually do a fairly good job with Fitment. I talked last quarter about the My Garage feature and how we've expanded that internationally, which helps with Fitment. We also recently announced a motorcycle parts finder in that business, and it tends to help and be benefited also from a cross-border trade.
To give you a sense of the scale, we've got hundreds of millions of listings in our parts business. And what I'm excited by is one of the first evolutions that we did was take all of that inventory and make it available on our Motors app, which is a dedicated separate app for vehicle enthusiasts, and now you've got vehicles and parts and accessories in a one-stop shop from that perspective. So you'll continue to hear further updates from us about that category. It's our next big category of focus and one where we're coming into it from a position of strength.
Operator
Thank you. We have our next question coming from the line of Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Doug Anmuth -- JPMorgan -- Analyst
Thanks for taking the questions. Two on payments, you've removed a lot of the friction already now that you have 90-plus percent of sellers migrate on to managed payments. Just what's next in terms of improving the experience going forward? And then just curious if you have any preliminary thoughts on some of the managed payments numbers in '22 in terms of revenue and operating income. Thanks.
Jamie Iannone -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yes. So first, on the friction, the whole idea of bringing commerce and payments together gives us great opportunities to remove friction. So on the selling side, people now only have to set up for a single account and get selling, all of their claims are managed in one place, tons of benefits from there. One of the ones that I'm really excited by is that since I worked at eBay the last time starting in 2001, unpaid items have been on this platform forever. And so now we've eliminated it in fixed price virtually. We're doing so in best offer. And so sellers won't have to face that issue and it takes friction out of the platform.
On the buyers side, it allows us to open up new opportunities for different forms of payments. So clearly, we've already integrated Apple Pay and Google Pay, but we launched a partnership with Afterpay in our Australia business for buy now, pay later. Afterpay is a very strong brand in that market, and that's bringing us new customers. It's already at 10% of our business there. And we're continuing to look at new opportunities for forms of payment for our buyers.
Secondarily is on the seller financing side. We launched a partnership in the U.K. with YouLend and opening up more opportunities for sellers now that we're processing such a large volume of payments through the business. So like I said in the call, the way I look at it is the migration is complete, but we're just getting started in terms of the opportunity of what we can do with commerce and payments together in a single flow and single experience.
Steve Priest -- Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer
Doug, with regard to your question on payments rollout 2022, too early to talk about 2022. We're not going to guide that at this point. But I did want to reiterate how delighted we are with the progress we've made with over 90% of the platform volume with over 18 million sellers going to the platform now. We laid out some goals going back a couple of years with regards to $2 billion of incremental revenue and $500 million of OI. We're well on track, Margin is in line. So we're very, very happy with where we are.
Doug Anmuth -- JPMorgan -- Analyst

We have our next question coming from the line of Brian Fitzgerald with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Brian Fitzgerald -- Wells Fargo -- Analyst
A couple of quick questions. Any impact on auction bid density from the loss of low-quality buyers or any impacts that may have on the marketplace beyond their just percentage of GMV? And then you recently during the summer started showing buyers, all shipping services offered by sellers, allows them to select carriers and shipping costs and estimated deliveries. It's still early days, but can you talk about what impacts that's happening, if any, on conversion rates?
Jamie Iannone -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yes. So on the first question, on auction bid density, no, we're not seeing any impact from that. Frankly, that format has actually been really strong because of the strength we're seeing in collectibles where it tends to be a more used format. And I'm excited that we're starting to launch express because that will give our auction sellers the ability to drive some more visibility for them and then to have a tool that they haven't been able to use before.
In terms of the shipping services, this has been a constant march for us. Last year, we expanded in the U.S. to have USPS, UPS and FedEx in there and did the same thing with Royal Mail and Australia Post to greatly exceed the amount of tracking.
On the specific shipping test that's going on now, it's kind of too early to tell. What I would say in general is how to think about this, Brian, is I'm trying to get the whole company focused on how do we make things as simple and as easy to do on the platform. So what we're doing with our new seller flows, with computer vision and trading cards is how do we take all the work out of the listing process. We're trying to do the same type of thing with our sellers and the stores product and making it really easy to get that set up on the platform. And shipping is one of those areas where there's an opportunity to take a lot of the friction out.
So the new partnerships that we've created, the integrated tracking, the smoother returns process is all part of this evolution of just make the whole platform so much easier to use. And so we'll keep you posted on how these tests roll out, but I'm happy with the progress so far.
Brian Fitzgerald -- Wells Fargo -- Analyst
Thanks, Jamie. Appreciate it.
Operator
We have our next question coming from the line of Tom Champion with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.
Tom Champion -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst
Good afternoon. Thanks very much. Jamie, I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit about bidadoo. Hopefully, I'm pronouncing it right. It looked like you made an investment, but it seems like kind of a B2B or commercial product. How does this fit strategically? And then I noticed the C2C GMV was down 13%. I think that was a little below GMV overall. This usually outperforms and just curious what might have driven the result there.
And Steve, maybe just a quick one for you. Buybacks $7 billion looks like $3 billion in repurchases this quarter, increased from $5 billion in repurchases last quarter. I'm just curious if the increase in the buyback reflects greater confidence in the fundamentals. Any thoughts on that would be helpful. Thank you.
Jamie Iannone -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yes. So on the first one, look, I've been talking since last July about a game-changing level of trust on the platform, and we've been doing that kind of category by category. So the authentication that we've been doing in the luxury categories really takes trust off the table these two-year warranties that we put in place for Certified Refurbished does the same thing. And eBay actually has a good sized business and industrial business in capital equipment, and bidadoo allows us to put a whole different level of trust in there. They're a longtime seller and partner on eBay and the capabilities that they will bring to that category will help bring a new level of trust and just help buyers and sellers in that category move forward. So that's what I would say on bid a deal.
On the C2C, that's really just the lapping of the COVID dynamics that we saw from last year in terms of the number of sellers that came on during that time period and just some of the macro dynamics. What I'd tell you is I'm really happy with the progress and continue to be a huge focus for us is on our C2C selling experience, bringing them on to the platform, making it extremely easy, making that payment sign-up process really simple. And so that's going to continue to be something that we're going to focus on quarter after quarter because as I mentioned in the past, we -- when we talk about high-value buyers, that includes buyers who sell. So by nature, it helps drive them up their buyer cohort curves as well as bringing that unique inventory. So we're going to continue to push forward there.
And then, Steve, do you want to take the last one?
Steve Priest -- Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer
Yes. Thanks, Jamie. Tom, I think it's been interesting being at the company about four months now. And I think the one thing I would say is just what's really struck me is the durability of the financial model with best-in-class margins, really significant value in the underlying platform and a fortress balance sheet.
If you take that and you pair it with the strategy that Jamie has laid out and the momentum that we're going forward with, I think the eBay franchise is pretty misunderstood. And one of the things that we need to do a better job is just really ensuring that the investor community understand a little better. And again, your point is well made. The momentum we've shown on the buyback and capital allocation. as you progress through 2021 from the 2 billion to the 5 billion and now the 7 billion is really a sort of a reflection of that in terms of our thought process around balanced and disciplined capital allocation. and getting that balance right between reinvestments in the business to stimulate growth and providing the robust returns to our shareholders.
Tom Champion -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst
Thank you.

We have our next question coming from the line of Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Stephen Ju -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst
Okay. Thank you so much. So Jamie, I think in your prepared remarks, you talked about what sounded like a 3D modeling technology you're using in the sneakers category. So how easy or difficult is this to do? And presumably, hopefully, this is driving higher conversion rates where this is rolled out as you're presenting more information to the buyer. So can you talk about which other categories this actually might be rolled out to?
And I guess as a follow-up to the earlier C2C question, as you get more and more buyers to become sellers over time, are you seeing pretty consistent behavior with the newest batch of converted users versus the earlier cohorts? Thanks.
Jamie Iannone -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yes. So on your first question, it's a very early test in pilot that we're doing. But the idea is we want buyers to be able to see in real detail the actual item that they're going to be. And so you're going to see us launching a couple of sneakers in the coming weeks using this. And it's a very early pilot that we're doing with select sellers. But it's all about building trust on the platform. I bought a $4,000 OBO on the platform last year, and it was great. I could see a lot of images, but the opportunity to really get in there in 3D and see what a pre-loved product looks like is an interesting opportunity.
So like I said, it's early, you'll start to see some products that we have using that technology. But I'm what I'm excited by is like the innovation and computer vision, we're using our AI resources and computer vision resources here to do some interesting things that, over time, I think will really change the buying experience on eBay.
To your question on C2C, it looks pretty similar to historical behaviors and consistent in terms of them coming on to the platform, continuing to list and then turning into buyers. What I'd say is the other thing is that a lot of our business sellers actually started out as C2C sellers. So it's another reason we lean in there.
I was visiting with a seller up in Seattle, and he started many years ago. He had an extra set of tires sold them on eBay and then just start to sum a couple more things than tires, now several times now runs a huge lug nuts business as a business seller with a warehouse and lots of employees. So that's the other kind of key focus for us on C2C is that's how a lot of our B2C sellers actually got their start in the platform.

Thank you. We have our next question coming from the line of Dan Salmon with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Dan Salmon -- BMO Capital Markets -- Analyst
Great. Thanks. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for slipping me in. First, Jamie, can you just expand a little bit on the affiliate program that you cited as one of the three new initiatives for Promoted Listings the opportunity to take it off platform? What are you hoping we're probably hoping to solve for your sellers with that? And if you could add some color on how significant you think that opportunity could be relative to the $1 billion run rate that you're the on-site Promoted Listings business?
And then just second for Steve, to what extent, I guess, put simply, will you go to exit low-value buyers? You said you expect the metric to remain under pressure, and the strategy certainly seems sound. But is your goal here to ultimately exit all of those low-value buyers? I'm just hoping you can add some context for the scope of the strategy. Thank you.
Jamie Iannone -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yes. So on the first one, the off-eBay advertising product, let me separate that from the affiliate advertising we do. So an affiliate can actually come on to the platform and be an affiliate. But the two definitely work hand-in-hand together. The whole vision there is really connecting enthusiasts to sellers. So being out on the platforms where those enthusiasts are and letting our sellers partake in that advertising by putting really interesting items in front of those enthusiasts of driving that marketing because eBay has been doing this marketing, and when we do it in cooperation with our sellers, it gives us a really broad reach.
For sellers, it gives them another tool as well to take all the great inventory that they have on eBay and put it out in front of sellers in various communities, in different places in search, et cetera, to really drive that traffic to their business on eBay.
I'll let Steve take the second one, and maybe I'll add on a bit.
Steve Priest -- Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer
Dan, no, it's not about exit. It's about focus. And I think we're constantly thinking about acquisition of buyers and growth on the platform. And really, it's about really changing our strategy and our focus.
And I sort of just want to reiterate about the value that various buyers bring. So if I think about our top 20 high-value buyers or 20% of our buyers and deliver 75% of our GMV, and those buyers are making six different prices, six different times a year and over $800 and that buyers itself, whereas the low-value buyers were about 50% of our buyers and generate about 5% of our GMV. So you can obviously see why we're focused on that strategy as we continue to evolve the platform, focused on the enthusiasts, focused on cross-category selling, but it's very, very important that we continue to have a pipeline as we evolve the business and grow it going forward.
Jamie Iannone -- President and Chief Executive Officer
It actually ties in well with your first question, Dan, about the advertising product is how do we make sure we're in those places where we actually get a fire those high-value enthusiasts and putting our focus and intention, not just around the number of buyers that we have on the platform, but much more focused on how we're turning buyers into high-value enthusiasts and how we're altering our marketing plans so that we're out there actually acquiring them onto the platform because that's what drives the real health of the business is the growth of -- the growth of those high-value buyers and how we're doing and connecting those enthusiasts. So good question because the two really tie together.
Dan Salmon -- BMO Capital Markets -- Analyst

(EBAY) Wednesday reported a drop in third-quarter profit, despite 11% growth in revenues. However, both earnings and revenues trumped Wall Street estimates.
The online e-commerce giant also witnessed a decline in consumer online spending and active buyers. Shares of the company slipped 5%, hurt largely by its outlook for the fourth quarter.
eBay's third-quarter profit dropped to $264 million or $0.40 per share from $664 million or $0.94 per share last year. Adjusted income from continuing operations was $591 million or $0.90 per share, compared to $584 million or $0.82 per share a year ago.
Revenues for the quarter increased 11 percent to $2.50 billion from $2.26 billion last year.
Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected earnings of $0.89 per share and revenues of $2.46 billion for the quarter.
The company's gross merchandise volume, which is the value of goods sold on its websites, tanked 10% to $19.5 billion in the quarter. Annual active buyers declined by 5%, for a total of 154 million global active buyers, while annual active sellers were flat at 19 million global active sellers.
""Our team delivered another strong quarter, once again meeting or surpassing our expectations for all key business metrics, making further progress on our multi-year strategy,"" said Jamie Iannone, Chief Executive Officer of eBay.
Looking forward to the fourth quarter, the company expects revenues between $2.57 billion and $2.62 billion and adjusted earnings of $0.97 to $1.01 per share. Analysts currently expect earnings of $1.00 per share on revenues of $2.65 billion.

2021-10-27 00:00:00+00:00,Shift in Strategy Will Hurt ContextLogic Stock in the Short Run ,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/shift-in-strategy-will-hurt-contextlogic-stock-in-the-short-run-2021-10-27,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Certain investment trends are considered sure-shot winners in today’s market. One of them is e-commerce. So, it’s surprising that ContextLogic (NASDAQ:WISH) stock is trading at a steep discount to its IPO at $24 a share.
Source: sdx15 / Shutterstock.com
Unlike several other major e-commerce giants like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY), WISH stock trades at just 1x price-sales.
There are several key reasons why this is so. First, the quarterly results did not do the company any favors. Customer experience is of utmost importance in the retail space. Unfortunately, WISH is suffering because of lackluster product quality. It is working on improving this situation. But these issues are rarely addressed overnight. Nevertheless, customers rarely spare poor quality and product defects, especially in developed economies, which are the biggest target markets for the company’s portal, wish.com.
In anearnings call ContextLogic expressed the intention of investing time and resources into updating apps and optimizing its merchants’ quality and products. As we all know, Wish is one of the world’s largest online shopping communities with over 300 million products, and it has more than 1 million merchants on its platform. It has reduced costs by lowering markups and connecting buyers directly, regardless of brand name or popularity, for everyone involved to get their desired product at an affordable rate.
But these merchants need to be screened under a minimum standard of excellence. Considering the size of the company, it is not an easy task. However, management has experienced hands that can build on its enticing business model.
The company has the opportunity to turn things around by focusing on quality. If they do this, then I think that stock will have a chance at success again.
Operational Problems Affecting WISH Stock
Though Wish’s popularity is on the rise worldwide, developed economies dominate the user base. The U.S. contributes the most revenue to its sales across various markets, including Europe, where demand grows steadily every year. Since Wish is a U.S.-based company, having Chinese merchants make most of its vendor pool could be controversial.
7 High-Yield Stock Gems for Income-Obsessed Investors
North American merchants are known for emphasizing quality and brand value. Although standards are improving, Chinese standards are not as stringent. And there are several examples quoted by ContextLogic users of substandard and defective products arriving at their door. It may not irk local Chinese customers. In contrast, North American and European consumers will find exceptions to the severe quality issues on the network.
CEO Peter Szulczewski understands these issues. Hence, he, along with the management team, is looking to deter fake goods on their site. The executive is conscious of how negative consumer experiences greatly damage customer trust and hurt gross merchandise value, tarnishing brand equity.
To accomplish the task, the company is pulling back on digital ad spending. As a result, the number of app downloads is decreasing. And this trend will not let up any time soon. It will create interim headaches for stockholders. But if you are looking to invest for the long term, this is an important issue the company must address before moving forward.
Sobering Results
Due to the prevailing situation, ContextLogic is slashing its advertising budget and redirecting resources to other areas. It has dealt well with a decrease in transaction volume and rising logistics costs due to supply chain issues in China by making adjustments that are key for success.
In the second quarter, revenues fell 6% from the previous year to $656 million. Logistics segment revenue grew by 126% over the last quarter to reach $228 million; great news for customers who need products delivered efficiently and logistics providers looking for a strong platform. It helped offset marketplace revenues, which suffered a 29% decline.
App installations fell 13%, and average time spent on the platform decreased 15% sequentially. The total monthly active users decreased 22% from a year ago to 90 million. It is not surprising as the ease of stay-at-home restrictions worldwide and a revival of brick-and-mortar store visits have combined to weigh down sentiments.
Play the Long Game With WISH Stock
There are things to like and dislike about WISH in equal measure. On the one hand, you have an e-commerce play trading at a historical discount. It focuses on the budget-conscious consumer, an oft-neglected segment. The other obvious risk factor is further declining monthly active users and revenue. If the trend continues, WISH stock will have a lot of questions to answer. However, the fourth quarter is always a good one for retail companies. It will not be different this year.
Shares are already on the rise. The momentum in the last few weeks has been very pleasing. However, they will rise exponentially once the forthcoming earnings report is released.

That's because movement and timing restrictions resulted in difficulties in procuring these items.
Using the TipRanks stock comparison tool, we will compare two popular online merchandise companies, Amazon, and eBay, and examine how Wall Street analysts feel about these stocks.
Amazon (AMZN)
Amazon is expected to announce its Q3 results on October 28. In Q3, the e-commerce giant anticipates net sales to range between $106 billion and $112 billion, representing an increase of between 10% and 16% year-over-year.
Operating income is projected to range from $2.5 billion to $6 billion in the third quarter, versus $6.2 billion in the same quarter of last year.
On the company’s Q2earnings call Amazon’s CFO Brian Olsavsky elaborated further on the revenues growth rate, stating, “Since May 15, again, excluding Prime Day, our year-over-year growth rate has dropped into the mid-teens. Our Q3 revenue guidance range of 10% to 16% growth reflects an expected continuation of this trend.”
Furthermore, Olsavsky added that the company expects “this pattern of difficult year-on-year revenue comps to continue for the next few quarters.”
Monness Crespi Hardt analyst Brian White expects that AMZN will meet the analyst’s revenue forecast of $111 billion (a growth of 15% year-over-year) and the earnings estimate of $9.05 per share.
The analyst added that given that Prime Day was held in the second (June) quarter, rather than the traditional July timeframe, it is likely that the company is likely to experience a first sequential quarter-over-quarter decline in net sales in Q3.
White is bullish, with a Buy rating and a price target of $4,500 (34.9% upside) on the stock.
When it comes to Amazon’s cloud services business, Amazon Web Services (AWS), White expects AWS to register a year-over-year growth of 33% with revenues of $15.4 billion in Q3. (See Analysts’ Top Stocks on TipRanks)
In Q2, AWS posted revenues of $14.8 billion, up 37% year-over-year and comprising 13% of the company’s total revenues of $113.08 billion. Furthermore, reflecting the upward trajectory of this business, the company’s management said on its Q2earnings callthat currently, AWS is “a $59 billion annualized run rate business, and that's up from $43 billion at this time last year.”
Analyst White is also positive about AMZN's growth across its different segments including e-commerce, Alexa, digital media and advertising. However, the analyst cautioned that as “Amazon continues to aggressively invest back into the business to grow at a rapid rate, the company’s profitability is well below its long-term potential.”
As a result, the analyst believes that “traditional P/E metrics are not applicable, nor other profit metrics, thus we value the stock on an enterprise-value-to-revenue ratio.”
Turning to the rest of the Street, Wall Street analysts are bullish about Amazon, with a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 31 Buys.
The average Amazon price target of $4,180.13 implies 25.3% upside potential from current levels.
eBay (EBAY)
eBay is an online marketplace that connects buyers and sellers in 190 markets around the world. The company is expected to announce its Q3 results on October 27.
In Q3, eBay anticipates earning revenues between $2.4 billion to $2.47 billion, with an organic currency-neutral growth rate between 6% and 8% year-on-year. Adjusted diluted earnings are expected to come in between $0.86 per share and $0.90 per share.
Currently, the company is in a transition phase. In July this year, eBay announced that it will reduce its 44% stake in Adevinta, an online classified marketplace, to approximately 33%. The company will sell around 125 million Adevinta shares, with an option to sell an additional 10 million shares to Permira, an investment firm, for approximately $2.25 billion in cash. The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of this year.
In addition, eBay will sell off 80% of its business in Korea, for around $3 billion, to Emart. The deal is likely to close by the end of this year or early next year.
Jamie Iannone, eBay’s President and CEO, commented on its Q2earnings call “These portfolio changes allow us to intensify our focus on the core eBay business moving forward.”
It seems that the company’s core business is doing well, as Robert W. Baird analyst Colin Sebastian’s ebay.com tracker seemed to indicate that “volume trends are directionally in-line with estimates.” Furthermore, the analyst added, “In our tracker, Q3 volume is ~15% above comparable 2019 levels.”
The analyst is bullish, with a Buy rating. He raised the price target from $70 to $80 on the stock.  
Moreover, Sebastian is of the view that the company’s “Managed Payments will provide significant boost to revenues and profits over the next 2-3 years.”
Managed Payments is eBay’s own payment platform that processes payments for purchases through eBay. Indeed, in Q2, 71% of buying on eBay was processed through Managed Payments. Moreover, the company’s management commented on itsearnings call “We exited Q2 at a run rate over 80% and are on track to process over 90% this quarter.” (See Top Smart Score stocks on TipRanks)
The analyst is also positive about the company’s advertising momentum, growth in e-commerce, and focus on technology.
 Turning to the rest of the Street, Wall Street analysts are cautiously optimistic about eBay, with a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 6 Buys and 8 Holds.
The average eBay price target of $76.57 implies approximately 5% downside potential from current levels.
Bottom Line
Analysts are bullish about Amazon while they are cautiously optimistic about eBay. Based on the upside potential over the next 12 months, Amazon does seem to be a better Buy.

It’s fair to say that ContextLogic (NASDAQ:WISH) stock has been a bust so far.
Source: sdx15 / Shutterstock.com
The high-speed e-commerce train keeps chugging along, albeit at a slower pace.
The supply chain issues hurting other industries are having an identical impact on the biggest technology conglomerates in the world. A
gainst this backdrop, it should come as no surprise that online e-commerce platform for budget consumers, ContextLogic is struggling. WISH stock is changing hands for around $5.20 apiece, which puts it dangerously close to the penny stock category. To put things in perspective, the company went public in December 2020 at $24 per share.
Of course, there were a few things that made the perfect storm for this one. ContextLogic’s platform has faced certain product quality issues. Although it is marketed as a budget retailer, low-quality products will not win over fans and reduce the churn rate.
On a separate note, the company is changing its strategy. It is spending less on advertising and directing those funds toward operational improvements.
Although ContextLogic did very well last year, it is not as well known as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) or eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) just yet. To continue building brand awareness, the company will have to keep spending cash. However, pulling back in this area will undoubtedly hurt in the short term.
7 of the Best Dividend Stocks for Passive Income
Finally, the company is suffering from tough year-on-year comparisons. Last year, the whole world was under lockdown.
With people less likely to visit the company’s platform to make purchases,  the number of transactions and users naturally will fall. That is something not under ContextLogic’s control, but it is still having a massive effect on the bottom line.
Having said all of this, considering the steep drop, there is merit to treating this as a contrarian play.
Every Cloud Has a Silver Lining
ContextLogic owns WISH.com, one of the largest e-commerce platforms in the world. For the full year 2020, monthly active users (MAUs) jumped 19% over the year-ago period to over 107 million.
Revenues rose 31 percent increase year-on-year to finish at $2.5 billion. Wish became a tour de force last year with more than 100 million monthly active users and approximately 500 million registered users.
However, things have slowed down considerably in the latest quarter. Wish’s revenue for the second quarter of 2021 is down 6% from a year ago.
The company reported a loss of $67 million on adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) compared to profit during their previous fiscal period.
There is nothing here to be alarmed about. Due to the pandemic, people were more inclined towards purchasing items online. It’s only natural that now since restrictions are lifted, people are making the odd visit to the store to be around people again. Naturally, this will affect e-commerce companies.
Even companies like Amazon and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) are not immune. You also have to factor in the supply chain issues that are still plaguing these companies because of the pandemic.
PCs, smartphones and other devices are being held back by global shortages of shipping containers and semiconductors.
Meanwhile, Wish has decided to shift focus away from advertisements and customer acquisition towards strengthening internal processes to reach their full potential as a business. I have touched upon my issues with this strategy in earlier pieces. Without retreading old ground, hopefully, management will try and change their strategy regarding this area.
What Sets WISH Apart Is the Platform
Ultimately, ContextLogic’s future will be decided by the WISH.com platform. So far, recent product issues aside, it has done well with budget-conscious consumers.
In a world where 75% of WISH users have an income below $75,000 and the vast majority purchase through their mobile app, investors can rest easy.
The WISH App has a scrollable personalized feed tailored to your interests – it automatically finds content geared towards what you’re looking at or doing as you shop. With zero search queries accounting for 70% of their total sales revenue by 2020 (and growing), there isn’t anything else like them out there either on mobile devices or anywhere else online.
It is also evident from recent numbers that regular users are also spending more time on the app and spending more money as well. Maximizing average revenue per user (ARPU) is a key concern for every e-commerce enterprise out there. Despite the already impressive growth, WISH has a solid platform to build upon despite product quality issues.
WISH Stock Is Trading at an Enviable Discount
WISH stock has what it takes to mount a comeback. The global pandemic increased digital traffic to all-time highs. We are seeing numbers go back to normal with people using their devices less than normal.
With the growth of internet adoption and 5G connections, e-commerce will be on an upswing in the coming years. Considering several e-commerce enterprises are trading at high price multiples, WISH stock offers a much more affordable way to play this trend.

2021-10-25 00:00:00+00:00,Ebay Earnings Preview: Mixed Sentiment,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/ebay-earnings-preview%3A-mixed-sentiment-2021-10-25,,,"The ecommerce industry has been on quite the ride over last few quarters. The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the shift toward a digitized retail sector, and had no signs of slowing, until now. Many ecommerce firms, and in particular Ebay Inc. (EBAY) are up against tough comparisons from their past earnings performances. The online marketplace is expected to report its Q3 earnings results after market close on Wednesday, October 27.  
In its previous report for Q2, the company printed strong results across the board, surprising on its earnings per share (EPS) by 2.17%. During that report, the company had announced an increase to its robust share repurchasing program, and also announced a sale of the majority of its Korean business.  
Providing his hypothesis on the soon-to-be presented earnings, Daniel Salmon of BMO Capital Markets wrote that Ebay “continues to create value through spinoffs, new minority interests, and strong commitment to buybacks.” The five-star analyst was encouraged by the firm's past performance, and raised his price target to $71 from $63.  
However, he added that he expects a decline in gross merchandise value for the upcoming report, as well as for the months thereafter. Salmon also lowered his EBITDA estimates, due in part by the divestiture of Ebay’s Korean segment. Despite this, he did consider that the funds raised by selling divesting can be used to repurchase more stock going forward.  
According to data aggregated by TipRanks, Ebay is forecasted to report 0.89 in earnings per share. The online retailer marketplace reported EPS of 0.85 last year for the same quarter.  
To gain more insight on Ebay’s engagement levels, TipRanks Website Traffic tool can be employed.  
Traffic Stats 
TipRanks' Website Traffic Signal, whose data is provided by SEMrush Holdings (SEMR), shows another perspective for the curious investor to take into account. Quarter-over-quarter, total visits to ebay.com have declined –6.41%, while the stock valuation has fallen –0.54%. However, if comparing year-to-date of this year to the same time frame in 2020, one can observe a 4.56% gain in total visits across all devices.  
While the decrease in quarter-over-quarter visits is discouraging for Ebay, the latter metric shows a significant increase in traffic even from the depths of the pandemic lockdowns, when online usage was at its peak. EBAY’s relevance has continued to strive on, even as economies largely reopened.  
Global User Data 
Furthermore, breaking down the data by region can provide a glimpse at international macro trends.  
Visitors to ebay.com are overwhelmingly from the U.S., at about 78.2% of total users. Following the U.S. is the United Kingdom, which saw 3.5% of total global traffic.  
How do the most traffic-heavy nation’s stats stack up against last year's stats? Across all devices, year-to-date growth has gained 5.49%.  
Wall Street Weighs In  
Largely, the sentiment on Ebay is mixed. There is no overwhelming bullish or bearish sentiment on which short-term investors could confidently stand.  
Salmon of BMO Capital went on to describe Ebay’s current situation. He wrote, “Investor debate is focused on the increasingly competitive eCommerce environment, which is also facing tough comps. We remain Market Perform as divestiture catalysts seem exhausted, yet valuation is undemanding.” 
Regarding the remainder of financial analysts on TipRanks, Ebay has an analyst rating consensus of Moderate Buy, based on 6 Buy and 7 Hold ratings. The average Ebay price target is $76.77, reflecting a possible –4.74% downside from Friday’s closing price of $80.59 per share.

2021-10-24 00:00:00+00:00,Which Stocks Are More Attractive Than eBay's Stock?,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/which-stocks-are-more-attractive-than-ebays-stock-2021-10-24,,,"We believe that there are other stocks that are currently better valued than eBay’s stock (NASDAQ: EBAY). EBAY’s current price-to-operating income ratio (P/EBIT) of 16.7x is higher than levels of 13.3x for PerkinElmer (NYSE: PKI), 10.7x for AGCO (NYSE: AGCO), 6.27x for Dish Network (NASDAQ: DISH), 5.45x for Lennar (NYSE: LEN) and 5.45x for Bio-Rad Laboratories (NYSE: BIO). These stocks have a lower valuation (P/EBIT) compared to eBay, while most of them have seen better revenue and operating income growth. This disconnect between valuation and performance could mean that you are better off buying PKI, AGCO, DISH, LEN and BIO vs. EBAY stock. More specifically, we arrive at our conclusion by looking at historical trends in revenues, operating income, and P/EBIT for these companies. Our dashboard – Better Bet Than EBAY Stock: Pay Less To Get More From Stocks PKI, AGCO, DISH, LEN, BIO – has more details – parts of which are summarized below.
1. Revenue Growth
eBay’s revenue grew at an average rate of 2% over the last three years, as compared to average revenue growth of 3.2% for Dish Network, 3.5% for AGCO, 5.7% for Bio-Rad Laboratories, 19% for PerkinElmer, and 24% for Lennar. If we look at the revenue growth over the last twelve month period, eBay’s revenue growth of 27% compares favorably with a 13% growth of Lennar, 22% growth of AGCO and similar to 26% of Bio-Rad Laboratories, but it is lower compared to average growth of 41% for Dish Network, and 54% for PerkinElmer.
2. Operating Income Growth
The three-year average operating income growth for eBay stands at 24% which is similar to 25% of AGCO and 26% of Dish Network but lower than 42% of Lennar, 68% of PerkinElmer, and 263% of Bio-Rad Laboratories. If we look at operating margin growth for the last twelve months eBay’s operating margin growth of 32% is lower than 90% for Lennar, 107% for Bio-Rad Laboratories, 109% for Dish Network, 275% for AGCO, and 297% for PerkinElmer.
The Net of It All
As we can see over the last three years, PerkinElmer, AGCO, Dish Network, Lennar, and Bio-Rad Laboratories have higher revenue growth and operating income growth compared to eBay. Despite better profit and revenue growth in the last three years, these companies have a comparatively lower P/EBIT. Even if we were to look at the last twelve months’ operating income growth a year ago, PerkinElmer, AGCO, Dish Network, Lennar, and Bio-Rad Laboratories fare better compared to eBay, and even then eBay was trading at a higher multiple.
eBay’s persistent underperformance in revenue and operating income growth compared to the other five companies reinforces our conclusion that the stock is expensive compared to them, and we think this gap in valuation will eventually narrow over time to favor the group of more attractively priced names. As such, we believe that PerkinElmer, AGCO, Dish Network, Lennar, and Bio-Rad Laboratories are currently better buying opportunities compared to eBay.
Also eBay Peer Comparisons summarizes how the company fares against peers on metrics that matter.

2021-10-24 00:00:00+00:00,3 Things to Watch in the Stock Market This Week,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-things-to-watch-in-the-stock-market-this-week-2021-10-24,,,"Stocks rose last week, as both the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES: ^DJI) and the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) gained more than 1%.
Earnings season ramps up with a flood of fresh earnings reports over the next few trading days.
Let's take a closer look at a few highly anticipated announcements from this list, by Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), McDonald's (NYSE: MCD), and eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY).
Image source: Getty Images.
1. Apple's holiday outlook
Apple announces its fiscal fourth quarter results on Thursday, and expectations could hardly be higher heading into this week's report. The iPhone maker has refreshed its entire product lineup at an ideal time, given that demand for premium consumer electronics is soaring.
That stellar selling environment helps explain why most investors who follow the stock are looking for Apple to add an incredible $20 billion to its Q4 sales base, with revenue reaching $85 billion. Wall Street will be watching for confirmation of the popularity of new hardware products like the iPhone 13, and Apple's growing services offerings that carry much higher profit margins.
The big number to watch on Thursday will be Apple's outlook for the critical holiday shopping season. This forecast will incorporate the latest demand trends, but also any supply chain issues. CEO Tim Cook and his team tend to be conservative with their short-term predictions, though, and so investors shouldn't be rattled by a seemingly weak outlook on Thursday.
2. McDonald's customer traffic
McDonald's has some big questions to answer for investors in its Wednesday report. The fast-food titan returned to sales growth in the previous quarter, but COVID-19 challenges returned in many key markets in Q3. We'll learn this week whether Mickey D's lost its positive momentum from these outbreaks.
Keep an eye on customer traffic, which hadn't recovered fully even by mid-2021. McDonald's growth outlook will be especially bright if it can return to traffic gains even as its mobile ordering channel keeps expanding. But competition is heading up in that niche, and in the drive-through segment that the company dominates today. We'll get key updates on McDonald's competitive posture
3. eBay's take rate
eBay's stock has trounced the market so far in 2021, but that outperformance will be tested with its Wednesday earnings report. Most of the online marketplace's growth and financial metrics have been moving in the right direction lately. Its buyer base and sales volumes are much higher today than they were before the pandemic struck. eBay is also pushing into attractive new categories, including advertising and payments processing.
The best news is that those initiatives are raising the value that eBay can provide to its sellers, and that success is allowing it to charge more for its services. The company's take rate, or seller fees, rose to over 11% of sales in Q2 – a new high .
Look for eBay to work toward deeper engagement with sellers and buyers this quarter through improvements to the shopping and purchasing experiences. Management will also target several new attractive demand niches, such as collectable sneakers and luxury watches.
On the financial front, look for eBay to again announce industry-leading cash flow and operating margins, thanks to its asset-light operating model. That middleman selling approach restrains its growth potential but can lead to cash flow and profitability that's far above the rates experienced by more traditional e-commerce retailers.

Danny Vena: Now, the SPAC that I'm going to talk about is a company that actually has very close ties to a company that is a Motley Fool favorite. Now, the SPAC that I'm talking about is the Meli Pioneer Corp., and the ticker is MEKA, and I'm just going to call it MEKA after this. The Meli Kaszek Pioneer Corp. Now, the sponsor of this company, first of all, there's a fellow by the name of Hernan Kazah, who is the managing partner of Kaszek, which is the largest venture capital company in Latin America.
Now, this guy has quite the tech pedigree. This is a guy who was the COO of MercadoLibre (NASDAQ: MELI) for nine years and the CFO of the company for three years. So you're already seeing what the connection here is, the connection is MercadoLibre. Now he's the co-CEO of MEKA. The other co-CEO is a fellow by the name of Pedro Arnt. Now, many of you may not recognize that name, but he is the current CFO of MercadoLibre, and has been since 2012. If you look at MercadoLibre, this is a stock that has gone up 5,000% since it went public back in, I want to say 2007. I'm not sure about the date. Since Motley Fool recommended this stock in early 2009, it's up more than 10,000%.
The thing that I really like about this is the fact that you have two co-sponsors, co-CEOs of the SPAC that have a track record of disruption and innovation. They started MercadoLibre and modeled it after eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY), then they turned around, and they modeled a payment system after PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL) that they then adjusted to meet the unique payment situation in Latin America. Latin America is still largely a cash-based society. But if folks want to use their digital payment method, they can walk into their local convenience store, plop down money, have it added to their account, and then they can use it like any other digital payment system. They've continued to innovate over the years. They do logistics, they do cross-docking, they'll help you set up your website.
They also have moved Mercado Pago, which is their payment method, off platform, meaning that it's now used in brick-and-mortar stores and has been growing at triple-digit rates for the last couple of years. This record of innovation from this company tells me that the executives at this company, the management of MercadoLibre, knows what it's doing. They know the market, and they're doing really well to capitalize on that. The fact that current and former executives from MercadoLibre are running the SPAC gives me a high level of confidence that the SPAC is likely to succeed, which is why I not only said it's my No. 1 place for new money, but it's actually the most recent stock that I've added to my portfolio.
Matt Frankel: I like this call. A recent study found that the No. 1 factor correlated to SPAC success is the sponsor, if the sponsor has relevant experience. I don't want to put words in Jon's mouth. But I think that's one of the things that we like the most about Latch, its sponsor had a lot of relevant experience.

2021-10-21 00:00:00+00:00,Are These 2 E-Commerce Stocks Turning Into Advertising Giants?,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/are-these-2-e-commerce-stocks-turning-into-advertising-giants-2021-10-21,,,"Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY) are e-commerce giants that are increasingly also discovering the wonders of advertising revenue. They each attract millions of customers to visit their sites, so showing advertisements is an excellent way to supplement their other revenue sources.
If they can execute their advertising push effectively, it has the potential to improve the customer's experience as well as boost profits. Let's look at how each is developing that side of the business and their progress thus far.

Amazon is already a major player in the ad market
The coronavirus pandemic fueled Amazon's growth in advertising sales. In 2020, the company increased its share of the U.S. digital ad market to 10.3% from 7.8% a year earlier, according to eMarketer.
In its most recent quarter, Amazon reported an 83% increase to $7.9 billion in advertising revenue from the same quarter last year. The segment is not only growing at a rapid rate, but has even accelerated for four consecutive quarters.
Amazon is also developing innovations for its ad business, launching new features and self-service capabilities, drawing more marketers, small businesses, and others by making it easier and more effective. The less time a company has to spend implementing an ad campaign, the more valuable it will view the service to be.
The company is also looking to make ads a helpful experience for customers. Amazon has millions of people who come to its site looking for products that fulfill their needs. With the right strategy, ads can enhance the customer experience by making it easier for consumers to find the products they are seeking.
eBay is growing ad revenue at a slower pace
While eBay is a much smaller company in terms of annual revenue than Amazon -- $10 billion compared to $386 billion in 2020 -- it is also working hard at increasing its ad business.
In its second quarter, eBay brought in $224 million of ad revenue, an increase of 8% from the same quarter last year. Here's what management had to say on that segment of the business in its quarterly conference call:
More than 1.4 million sellers promoted over 430 million listings during the quarter. Growth was driven by higher adoption and technology improvements .... We see tremendous growth opportunities in advertising, both from our existing Promoted Listings offerings and from new product innovations.
eBay, like Amazon, is working on innovating its ad business to make it more attractive for marketers and companies to utilize. Whereas it was primarily offering ""cost per click"" to advertise (charging every time a user clicks an ad), eBay now also offers a ""cost per view"" option (when a user simply views the ad). This can be less expensive for marketers but still provides another source of revenue for eBay.
The company has also launched ""promoted listings,"" allowing sellers to push their merchandise to the top of an eBay search result for a fee. eBay boasts 19 million sellers and just 1.4 million have used promoted listings -- so that leaves lots of room for improvement.
Why the focus on advertising?
Both Amazon and eBay are making advertising revenue an area of strategic importance. One reason could be the fact that it's a high-profit-margin business. The systems that the companies are creating will mostly be automated. Therefore, beyond the initial investment in setting up the capabilities, there's little cost to the incremental revenue -- and so greater potential for profit. Stay tuned.

Let’s jump into that news below to see what’s going on here.
According to these reports, Paypal is looking to acquire Pinterest in a $45 billion deal.
The insiders with knowledge of the deal claim that this will have Paypal acquiring PINS stock for $70 per share.
Reports of the deal broke on Wednesday and the offer from Paypal is nothing to sniff at.
Based on PINS stock’s closing price on Tuesday, the offer is a close to 26% premium.
Of course, neither Paypal nor Pinterest has confirmed the acquisition news.
Even so, the idea of Paypal picking up Pinterest makes sense.
Paypal has been picking up other companies since being spun off of eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) in 2015.
Specifically, it’s had a focus on companies tied to e-commerce.

Considering that PINS allows for purchases through its app, it’s a believable target for PYPL.
Unfortunately, it doesn’t look like investors in either company are excited about the deal.
Both are seeing their shares fall on Thursday with heavy trading.
In the case of PYPL stock, shares are down 5.2% with some 15 million changing hands.
That’s well above its daily average trading volume of 6.4 million shares.
PINS stock is slipping 2.5% as of this writing with some 13 million shares on the move.
The company’s daily average trading volume is 11.4 million shares.
