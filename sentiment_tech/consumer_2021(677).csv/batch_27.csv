2021-02-01 00:00:00+00:00,Australia media to plead guilty to breach of gag order on Pell conviction,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/australia-media-to-plead-guilty-to-breach-of-gag-order-on-pell-conviction-2021-02-01,,,"By Sonali Paul
MELBOURNE, Feb 1 (Reuters) - A dozen Australian media firms have agreed to plead guilty for breaching a suppression order on reporting on the trial and conviction of former Vatican treasurer George Pell in 2018 for child sexual assault, a court heard on Monday.
Pell was cleared last year of the sexual abuse charges after spending 13 months in prison.
The cardinal was found guilty by a jury in December 2018 of sexually assaulting two choirboys, making him the highest-ranking Catholic official convicted on child sex crimes.
Reporting on the trial and verdict was gagged Australia-wide by the County Court of Victoria to ensure the cardinal got a fair trial on further charges he was due to face. Those charges were later dropped.
As part of the agreement announced on Monday, the state prosecutor said it was dismissing charges of sub judice contempt against all of the media firms and all charges against 15 reporters and editors at those newspapers, radio and television stations.
The surprise agreement was reached nearly two years after the charges were brought, nearly three months after the media trial began and 10 months after Pell was acquitted by the High Court.
Despite the Australian gag on reporting, foreign media published news on the outcome of Pell's trial, naming him and the charges.
Australian media then published reports saying they were unable to cover major news about an unidentified high-profile person, with some pointing out that the news was accessible online.
The state initially alleged that dozens of media, journalists and editors, mostly with News Corp NWSA.O and Nine Entertainment Co NEC.AX and its Fairfax arm, had breached the suppression order and interfered with the administration of justice in running those articles.
Breaches of suppression orders can be punished with up to five years jail and fines of nearly A$100,000 for individuals and nearly A$500,000 for companies.
DISMISS CHARGES
Some charges had been dismissed over the past two years, but 79 charges remained as of January.
""The prosecution has resolved,"" prosecutor Lisa De Ferrari told the Supreme Court of Victoria on Monday.
""Each corporate respondent has indicated that it will plead guilty in respect of each publication for which they are charged to contempt by breaching the proceeding suppression order,"" she said.
""Given the plea and the acceptance of responsibility in respect of each publication ... the director (of public prosecutions) has determined that it is in the public interest to dismiss the remaining charges.""
The companies have also agreed to pay the costs of prosecution, she said.
The plea hearing has been set for Feb. 10-11.
Last week, former editor of the Age, Alex Lavelle, the first media witness to appear in the trial, told the court he ran a story only to explain why the newspaper could not cover the news that was being reported overseas, as the newspaper had received numerous queries from the public.
Readers were ""wondering if the Age was part of a Catholic church conspiracy"", Matthew Collins, the lawyer representing Nine Entertainment, told the court.
Lavelle said based on legal advice, he believed the article did not breach the suppression order.
A spokeswoman for Nine said in emailed comments: ""Our decision to enter a guilty plea was important to protect our individual people, who were simply going about their jobs.""
News Ltd, the Australian arm of News Corp, was not immediately available to comment.

2021-01-31 00:00:00+00:00,eBay Earnings: What to Watch,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/ebay-earnings%3A-what-to-watch-2021-01-31,,,"eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY) investors had a fantastic 2020, with the stock price comfortably outpacing the broader market during the pandemic-fueled e-commerce boom. Sure, companies like Amazon and Shopify posted wider gains. But eBay's nearly 40% share-price spike reflected some major operating wins and kept it ahead of other huge online businesses, including Walmart.
Investors are about to learn exactly how well eBay did in 2020 when the company announces its holiday season results. The strength of that performance, along with management's official outlook for 2021, will determine whether the stock continues its winning streak into the new year.
Let's take a closer look at the company in advance of the fourth-quarter earnings report's release on Wednesday, Feb. 3, and what investors should watch for.
Image source: Getty Images.
Merchandise volumes and conversion rates
eBay's core growth metric is the volume of merchandise moving through its platform. Soaring results here formed the basis for last year's stock surge. Volume had been flat or declining in the quarters before the pandemic struck but shot up to over 20% year over year as commerce stampeded to online channels beginning in late February.
This quarter's report will answer big questions around the sustainability of that spike. Volume gains year over year slowed to 21% in Q3 from 29% in the quarter that captured the most intense period of retailing shutdowns. For its part, management in late October forecast gains in the low double-digit percentages. However, eBay easily surpassed its last quarterly outlook, and investors are hoping for another beat this week.
Other indications of healthy market share would show in an expanding buyer pool and robust conversion rates for its product pages. CEO Jamie Iannone should comment on both these metrics on Wednesday.
Cash and profits
eBay's asset-light operating model restricts its growth potential a bit as compared to Amazon, but the trade-off is higher profitability and impressive cash flow. Earnings more than doubled last quarter as operating margin surged thanks to the combination of higher sales, lower expenses, and an uptick in seller transaction fees.
Wall Street is expecting more gains ahead in this area, with reported earnings set to rise to $0.83 per share compared to $0.66 per share a year ago. But the more useful figure to follow is cash flow. eBay generated $584 million of free cash flow in Q3, and the company needs more success here to meet management's goals of investing in the business while paying down debt and sending more cash to shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases.
The 2021 outlook
Iannone and his team will be looking at an unusually wide range of potential results as they craft their official 2021 forecast. Organic sales likely increased by at least 20% in 2020 compared to their initial prediction targeting a flat result. That boost sets a high bar for growth this year, but it also gives the marketplace giant momentum in a quickly growing industry.
The good news is eBay already showed off a few impressive competitive advantages at a time when sellers were looking for new platforms they could use to connect with their customers during COVID-19.
The company's main challenge for 2021 is convincing these small businesses to stick around, mainly by making the platform more popular with buyers and easier for sellers to use. These successes are the key to eBay protecting its positive momentum in what's likely to be a competitive selling period ahead for the e-commerce industry.

2021-01-30 00:00:00+00:00,Don't Waste Money on Penny Stocks -- These 3 Companies Are Better Buys,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/dont-waste-money-on-penny-stocks-these-3-companies-are-better-buys-2021-01-30,,,"Since the S&P 500 bottomed out last March, it has gone up more than 70%. Many individual stocks are doing even better with some returning 100%, 500%, or more than 1,000%. Missing out on those kinds of gains can hurt, and it unfortunately increases the coppery gleam of risky penny stocks.
Penny stocks typically trade under $5 per share and have very small market capitalizations. Investors believe their dollars stretch further since they can buy more shares. Even going up just a few bucks can lead to big-time returns -- at least that's the thought process.
But penny stocks are vulnerable to pump-and-dump schemes, leaving the bag in your unsuspecting hands. You could wait it out, but penny stock companies often have poor long-term prospects, exacerbating your losses over time.
For these reasons, I hope you stay away from most penny stocks. But don't lament your fleeting fortunes: These three stocks can still pad your pockets over the long haul. And they're even penny-themed picks.
eBay: A platform for buying pennies ... and a lot of other things
Online marketplace eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY) allows users to buy and sell almost anything, even rare pennies that sell for thousands of dollars. But the company doesn't provide the merchandise. It simply provides the platform, resulting in a stellar 77% gross profit margin. But while that's impressive, the company's 183 million active buyers are what truly make this an interesting company.
Many investors overlook eBay because it has reported low growth in recent years. However, the company's revenue was boosted by the pandemic: up almost 16% year over year through the first three quarters of 2020. But for some time, eBay has been a low-growth company, and yet, tens of millions continue to peruse its listings, a testament to its ongoing top-of-mind brand awareness.
And this intangible asset provides eBay with tangible growth opportunities. For example, the company began letting sellers advertise their listings. In the third quarter alone, these promoted listings accounted for 7% of total revenue, surging 79% year over year.
Moreover, the company recently returned to the payments space. In the last few months, hundreds of thousands of sellers have started using eBay's managed payments, which means investors should start seeing the long-term potential in coming quarters.
And eBay also started a used-merchandise authentication business, which it believes will deliver strong growth for years to come.
Because of its strong user base, the company has been able to identify these new monetization opportunities. With its stock trading at less than 16 times forward earnings, I don't believe the market is pricing in this growth potential. It could take some time to play out, but fortunately, eBay will pay you a low-yield (but growing) dividend while you wait.

Monster: When penny stocks go right
In rare cases, penny stocks can work out well long term, as is the case with Monster Beverage (NASDAQ: MNST). In Jan. 2004, the company had a market cap of just $70 million and a price per share around $0.12. Since then, Monster stock is up more than 60,000%. Despite concerns from the general public regarding the safety of energy drinks, and despite competitors with deeper pockets, this beverage company has done nothing but grow sales for 28 consecutive years.
Monster was a rare penny-stock success thanks to a smooth move from management. Before its success, the company was called Hansen's Natural, an underperforming beverage outfit selling juices and sodas. But management noticed the impressive growth of newcomer Red Bull in the budding energy-drink market, and they created Monster to compete. Fortunately, Hansen's already had experience in the beverage industry and had distribution agreements in place. These advantages helped Monster at launch, and it would go on to take market share.
Listen clearly: I don't expect Monster stock to return 60,000% over the next 17 years, as it did in the past 17 years, but it can still be a steady performer. Here are a few reasons to like it.
First, its broad beverage portfolio ensures it can adjust to new trends as they emerge, like how Monster's new drink Reign appeals to the growing fitness-energy trend. Second, only about 36% of net sales are from outside the U.S., suggesting a long growth runway overseas. And third, Monster has zero debt, almost $1.7 billion in cash and short-term investments, and is currently generating over $1 billion in annual net income, giving it an enviably solid financial position.
Image source: Square.
Square: Earning pennies but creating fortunes
Finally, fintech company Square (NYSE: SQ) turned a profit in the third quarter of 2020 -- a whole seven pennies per diluted share -- but don't let those meager profits fool you. The company is spending heavily on product development and sales and marketing in an effort to disrupt the entire financial industry.
There are two major sides to Square's business. The first is the Cash App: fintech solutions for individuals. As cash took a backseat during the pandemic, this business soared. Cash App revenue was up 574% in the third quarter alone. However, a lot of this was growth was driven by things that don't carry good profit margins. That said, high-margin subscription and service-based revenue was still up an impressive 154% year over year for Cash App in the third quarter.
The other side of Square's business is the seller side, which has struggled during the COVID-19 pandemic. Through the first three quarters of 2020, seller segment revenue was up less than 1% year over year. It's understandable -- many of the small and medium-size businesses Square serves were disproportionately affected by the coronavirus. But this might be an opportunity for 2021 as life returns to normal. Square played a big role in helping businesses endure. For example, its services help brick-and-mortar stores merge in-store inventory with an online presence. I'm betting business owners increasingly see that it pays to be prepared with services like those offered by Square.
As the business grows, it will keep plowing cash into new ancillary opportunities. For example, the company is rumored to be interested in acquiring music-streaming company Tidal. Therefore, expect pennies on the bottom line for the foreseeable future while it pursues any opportunity it can to grow its overall business.
Conclusion
The point is you don't need to plow hard-earned cash into sketchy businesses with uncertain prospects. eBay, Monster, and Square are all safer bets than most penny stocks. And they can beat the market average over the long haul.
That last point is important, because you don't need exponential gains to create long-term wealth. Simply beating market returns over the course of decades with safe stocks like these will get you there.

2021-01-29 00:00:00+00:00,3 Stocks That Could Set You Up for Life,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-stocks-that-could-set-you-up-for-life-2021-01-29,,,"2020 was a breakout year for new growth stocks and exciting IPOs. But while many of them are great companies that will provide sizable gains for intrepid investors, some of the best investments remain tried and true industry leaders.
These top stocks have well-established track records and the ability to continue outperforming long term. Nike (NYSE: NKE), PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL), and Costco (NASDAQ: COST) are great companies to add to your portfolio.
The king of athletic wear
Nike has been the leader in athletic footwear for decades, but with the rise of athleisure style and fashion, it's also become the leading U.S. apparel company. Sales fell 38% year over year during the early phases of the pandemic in 2020, but they quickly recovered with the company reporting 9% growth by its fiscal second quarter (ended Nov. 30).
Image source: Nike.
But there's more growth coming for the activewear giant. Nike considers itself a digitally-led company, and CEO John Donahoe, who took the helm last year, has a tech background, previously serving as the CEO of eBay. It now has a powerful digital program that its leveraging to create a community among Nike customers, changing how consumers engage with the brand and invigorating sales in the process.
Nike made headlines in 2019 when it announced that it would be curtailing its partnership with Amazon to focus on its direct-to-consumer (DTC) business, and that forward-thinking decision proved to be the right one as DTC continues to be a strong part of the company's growth. Nike DTC sales increased 32% in the fiscal second quarter, and digital sales rose 84%.
Donahoe summed it up when he said: ""Fueled by compelling innovative product and global brand momentum, we continue to extend our leadership. Our strategy is working, and we are excited for what's ahead.""
Nike stock has doubled over the past three years and pays a dividend yielding 0.8% to provide a little income, while shareholders let the magic of compounding do its work.
The leader in financial technology
Financial technology is a hot industry, and the field was birthed by PayPal, the original digital payments service. For obvious reasons, the pandemic has been a huge tailwind for PayPal. In the third quarter ended Sept. 30, total payment volume increased 36% year over year, and revenue was up 25%, the strongest quarter in an already impressive history.
Image source: PayPal.
But the shift to digital is still in its early stages, and the company expects to report similar revenue and volume growth in its fourth quarter, not to mention the 70 million new active accounts the company will likely add in full-year 2020. PayPal will report fourth-quarter results on Feb. 3.
As of the end of the third quarter, PayPal had 361 million active accounts, versus competitor Square's 30 million monthly active accounts for its Cash App peer-to-peer payments service.
PayPal faces plenty of competition, though, from traditional credit companies such as Visa and Mastercard to newer fintechs like Square and Affirm. But it's still leading the way, developing new partnerships and features, such as buy now, pay later financing.
Its stock gained nearly 200% over the past three years, and shareholders can expect more from the father of fintech.
A popular membership model
Groceries are one of the biggest regular expenses for Americans, and average weekly grocery spending increased during the pandemic from $163 to $190, according to a LendingTree survey.
Image source: Getty Images.
One of the beneficiaries of that extra spending was Costco, which saw sales increase 17% in its fiscal first quarter (ended Nov. 22), even faster than during the height of the COVID-19 lockdowns. And the king of warehouse clubs hasn't missed out on the digital channel as its e-commerce revenue surged 86% in the first quarter as well.
Costco operates with a paid membership model, and demand for memberships and the low prices that go with them is strong. Renewal rates come in steadily at approximately 90%, and membership fees alone came out to $861 million in the latest quarter. Members are also increasingly signing up for executive memberships, which cost double the standard membership fee of $60.
The company posted these stellar results despite several pandemic-related setbacks. Costco operates several ancillary businesses, including travel and optical departments, that are still not fully functional. It also hasn't been able to procure all of its supply, including exercise equipment and some electronic appliances.
Costco pays a quarterly dividend that yields 0.8% as of this writing, but it also has a history of paying special dividends with the latest one coming this past December at $10 per share. Though Costco stock has been the most modest performer among this industry-leading trio, shares still jumped over 80% in the past three years, and there's much more growth ahead.

Bitcoin (BTC) is all the rage these days. Once considered off-limits and dangerous, it became the hottest asset class in 2020, and it seems the momentum will not stop anytime soon. On Jan. 8, the cryptocurrency’s sizzling rally helpedbitcoin pricesnear a remarkable $42,000 on CoinDesk. Many who had scoffed at the digital asset are now forced to eat humble pie. More importantly, rookie investors say they’re buying the cryptocurrency due to FOMO, also known as “Fear of Missing Out.”
Bitcoin’s price surge in 2020 is one of the bizarre idiosyncrasies of an unbelievable year. JPMorgan Chase strategists John Normand and Federico Manicardi recently wrote, “Bitcoin has already achieved the fastest-ever price appreciation of any must-have asset.”
However, no matter what the analysts say, crypto prices have stoked a speculative mania among the Robinhood crowd, throwing fundamental and technical analysis to the wayside. Investors are finally getting comfortable allocating at least a small portion of their extra cash towards the digital asset.
That’s why we have compiled this list of five places an investor can go to purchase cryptocurrency. However, before we proceed further, a word of caution: JPMorgan Chase & Co. cross-asset strategists have said that the digital currency is lousy at compensating short-term drawdowns in big sell-offs. Last year, large U.S. financial institutions started including it in their operations. However, the volatility is still there.
Bitcoin recently closed in on the lowest in three weeks, sliding below $32,000. Notwithstanding, prices remain more than double the levels from early November, and some technical analysts argue that a pullback is long overdue.

So, happy trading on the next five platforms. However, keep in mind that this is a volatile asset.
Coinbase

Bisq

A cryptocurrency exchange headquartered in San Francisco, Coinbase is an excellent place to start for a newbie investor.
Coinbase provides market information and descriptions for 50 cryptocurrencies for over 35 million users in over 100 countries. Security is a major concern for several users. However, Coinbase has you covered there. Through Coinbase Vault, you can receive cryptocurrency like a normal wallet and limit stored crypto from being directly withdrawn by adding optional security steps. There’s also two-factor authentication and offline storage for digital assets.
When you conduct a transaction, Coinbase will tell you the transaction fees upfront. You will typically be charged a flat per-transaction fee and a spread of approximately 0.50%. However, it’s important to note here that transaction fees will vary depending on the source of funds for the purchase. For instance, it can rise to 3.99% when you use a debit card to buy. If you upgrade to Coinbase Pro, the company will charge you based on a different pricing model.
If you want to start your cryptocurrency journey, there is no better option than this one.

An Israeli social trading and multi-asset brokerage company, eToro’s disruptive trading platform allows you to trade and invest in cryptocurrencies, stocks, ETFs, currencies, indices, and commodities or copy leading investors.
The company provides an easy-to-use platform and free practice account with $100,000 in virtual money that lets you test out buying bitcoin without risking real funds. Once you are comfortable, you can perform transactions for a 0.75% spread price for bitcoin and higher fees for other currencies.

Additionally, the company offers the CopyTrader system for all those traders, enabling individuals to automatically copy positions opened and managed by other selected individuals.
Robinhood

Robinhood offers a mobile app and website that gives users the ability to invest in stocks, ETFs, and options through Robinhood Financial and crypto trading through Robinhood Crypto. The best thing about the application is that you don’t have to bear any transaction fees when making a purchase.
This may sound familiar for many retail traders, considering its stock market investing platform also doesn’t involve transaction fees. However, the Robinhood app and Robinhood Crypto platform are separate. You can use it alongside your Robinhood stock investment account if you have already registered for the other one.
Although the platform does not support a large selection of cryptocurrencies, Robinhood app traders will likely find using this program easier than some of the other constituents on this list.
PayPal
In the intro, we spoke about how cryptocurrencies are gaining more institutional support. In 2015, eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) spun off Paypal to eBay’s shareholders. The resulting financial services company provides electronic payment solutions to merchants and consumers, focusing on online transactions.
PayPal had 300 million active accounts at the end of 2019, including 20 million merchant accounts. It owns Xoom, an international money transfer business, and Venmo, a person-to-person payment platform.
PayPal allows its users to buy, sell, and hold four prominent cryptocurrencies – Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, and Litecoin. The platform allows you to buy cryptocurrencies like bitcoin for as little as $1. However, you have to pay a minimum fee of 50 cents for transactions below $25.
7 Fintech Stocks Leading the Payments Revolution
Additionally, for transactions below $100 you will have to pay 2% for transactions between $100 and $200, 1.8% for transactions between $200 and $1,000 and 1.5% for transactions of more than $1,000.
Bisq

We polish off our list with Bisq, an open-source desktop application that allows you to buy and sell bitcoins in exchange for national currencies or alternative cryptocurrencies.
For investors wanting some privacy, its decentralized peer-to-peer network is just what you are looking for. Furthermore, you don’t need to register with the platform to perform a transaction.
Trade fees range from 0.05% to 0.70%, depending on the payment method and other factors. Much like eBay, Bisq requires the traders to enter transactions themselves, unlike other platforms where this is automated for the traders. One negative aspect is the need for collateral when performing a transaction. Both parties are required to lock up their crypto to secure the trade.

2021-01-27 00:00:00+00:00,Wish IPO: Here's What You Should Know About the High-Growth E-Commerce Marketplace,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/wish-ipo%3A-heres-what-you-should-know-about-the-high-growth-e-commerce-marketplace-2021-01,,,"E-commerce unicorn Wish -- trading under parent company ContextLogic (NASDAQ: WISH) -- had one of 2020's most disappointing market debuts. Shares fell 16% on opening day following the IPO, despite hopes the company could one day rival Amazon. The stock trades at $27.10 as of this writing, slightly above its IPO price of $24.
Backed by prominent investors such as DST Global -- an early investor in Facebook and Twitter -- and Peter Thiel, Wish had all the trappings of a rising star. So what happened?
According to The Wall Street Journal, analysts think this lackluster start could've been due to the public's lack of familiarity with the Wish brand. But given time, could Wish grow into the likes of Amazon and Alibaba? It's still early days, but the company is smartly positioning itself for the future.
Image source: Getty Images.
The Wish business model
Founded in 2010, Wish is a global e-commerce platform that generates revenue by charging merchants a commission on sales made in its marketplace. The company also generates fees by offering advertising and logistics services to its merchants. With a range of beauty, clothing, and electronics products sold at wholesale prices, Wish has managed to garner a user base of 100 million monthly active users (MAUs) and 500,000 merchants.
Wish targets value-conscious shoppers with incomes below $75,000 per year. This segment accounts for 44% and 85%, respectively, of U.S. and European consumers. Unlike wealthier shoppers, this group of customers is extremely price sensitive and doesn't have as much regard for convenience and branding.
Borrowing a page from Pinduoduo, China's second-largest e-commerce player by active buyers, Wish gamifies the shopping experience, using features like sweepstakes to keep customers coming back. The similarities don't end there. Like Pinduoduo, Wish has adopted a mobile-first strategy. Its discovery-based shopping experience leverages user-generated content like photos, videos, and reviews -- as well as extensive data science capabilities -- to engage and grow its user base.
If numbers are anything to go by, shoppers seem to like this approach. Between 2015 and 2019, revenue rose more than tenfold from $144 million to $1.90 billion, driven by the growth of ""active buyers"" -- shoppers who made at least one purchase over a 12-month period -- from 18 million to 62 million.
Attractive long-term prospects
While Wish has had a stellar run so far, there's much to suggest its best days lie ahead.
For one, there is still an immense, untapped opportunity in e-commerce. By 2024, this market is expected to be worth $4.5 trillion -- that's more than double what it was in 2019, according to eMarketer forecasts cited in the Wish IPO prospectus.
With a global footprint, Wish allows its merchants to sell to over 100 countries via a single product listing. The company is in prime position to capture e-commerce growth, and with its focus on lower-income shoppers, Wish can serve a market of over one billion households, even excluding customers in China and India. To keep things in perspective, recall that Wish currently has only about 100 million MAUs.
While the company will want to acquire new shoppers from within its large target market, it can also convert more of its existing 100 million MAUs into monthly active buyers, of which it has just 12 million. To do that, Wish can expand its product categories or boost user engagement by offering more personalized items and discounts to encourage more frequent purchases.
Still, all of the above will work only if Wish keeps attracting and retaining high-quality merchants. With more merchants comes a broader product selection, making it easier to attract and retain shoppers, and the network effects become obvious. To support this effort, Wish launched Wish Local in 2019 to help brick-and-mortar stores upload their inventory onto its platform.
With Wish Local, customers can order items and pick them up in store, while merchant partners have the opportunity to advertise on the marketplace. And Wish itself benefits by expanding the reach of its fulfillment network without investing in expensive infrastructure. As of the IPO, there were 50,000 Wish Local partners in 50 countries.
Competition and risk
For all that's going in the company's favor, e-commerce is a notoriously competitive industry. Wish has to compete for shoppers with giant, established names like Amazon, eBay, Etsy, and other players around the world.
Against this backdrop, Wish spends a lot on customer acquisition. This explains its massive marketing expenses -- 64% of revenue in first three quarters in 2020 -- and the company's history of red ink on the bottom line. Revenue was up 32% in that same period, but the company's net loss surged year over year from $12 million to $176 million.
Cross-border e-commerce has also been slower to gain traction compared with local e-commerce (think Amazon Prime), as a result of logistics challenges and shortcomings in payments infrastructure. Though Wish has reduced these costs, there are still unsolved issues. For example, imagine the hassle a U.S. buyer has to go through when returning a product to a China-based merchant. The process will likely be long and messy. Language could also pose a challenge, despite translation tools being available.
Clearly, the same process would be much easier if the merchant is a local seller. While Wish's customers are generally willing to trade convenience for affordability, many shoppers won't -- and this could cap the company's growth potential.
For Wish to win sizable market share in worldwide e-commerce, it will have to fight off well-entrenched incumbents. Only time will tell if Wish lives up to investors' high expectations with shares trading for eight times trailing 12-month revenue as of this writing. Risk-averse investors are best off monitoring the company's performance in the coming quarters before making any investment decision.

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.

2021-01-25 00:00:00+00:00,"FOCUS-Online merchants linked to QAnon down, but not out, following platform bans",EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/focus-online-merchants-linked-to-qanon-down-but-not-out-following-platform-bans-2021-01-25,,,"By Jeffrey Dastin, Sheila Dang and Anna Irrera
Jan 25 (Reuters) - Since last year, entrepreneur Dustin Krieger has faced bans by an expanding list of big tech companies: four blocked PayPal PYPL.O accounts, half a dozen Twitter TWTR.N deactivations, de-listed merchandise by Shopify SHOP.TO and most recently Amazon's AMZN.O removal of his widely reviewed book promoting the QAnon conspiracy theory.
But he's not giving up.
""We'll maintain our own presence everywhere we are allowed,"" Krieger, president of a Wyoming-registered company, told Reuters.
Technology firms including Amazon.com Inc, eBay Inc EBAY.O, and PayPal Holdings Inc, which have taken action against businesses peddling extremism in recent years, have come down hard after the deadly Jan. 6 siege of the U.S. Capitol by supporters of former President Donald Trump.
Yet merchants like Krieger show how efforts to ""de-platform"" vendors, while lowering their revenues, have resulted in a game of whack-a-mole as individuals set up new accounts or shift to different sites, sometimes using cryptocurrency.
Krieger estimates he lost between $1 million to $2 million in sales from a crackdown that he said was being directed by a ""rabid leftist cancel culture mob,"" but he believes he can recover. ""The benefit of my business model is many legs to stand on, many patriots support one another and choose to shop patriot with our sponsors,"" he said over email. Krieger goes by ""Dustin Nemos"" on social media.
As of Sunday, Krieger's websites offered $19.99 ""Sleepy Joe"" sleep aids that refer derisively to President Joe Biden and a $15.45 per month ground coffee subscription named after the so-called ""Great Awakening"" linked to the QAnon theory, which claims Trump secretly fought a cabal of child-sex predators including Hollywood figures and prominent Democrats. Visitors can pay for some items through Visa Inc-owned V.N Authorize.net using major credit card networks.
A Visa spokesman said, ""We are vigilant in our efforts to deter illegal activity on our network, and we require our affiliate banks to review their merchants' compliance with our standards.""
DE-PLATFORMING
While it is difficult to estimate how much far-right and fringe causes earn in the United States, experts who study extremist groups say it can add up to big business.
Following the Capitol riot, Stripe suspended payment processing for Trump's campaign website. Reuters found that Trump merchandise sales on top e-commerce platforms and the president's campaign site, as well as supporters' fundraising to maintain billboards and fly aerial banners over cities, have garnered about $30 million in the past year, according to data from web analytics firm SimilarWeb and studies from several researchers.
Last year, fringe groups in particular generated at least $2 million according to researcher findings and an estimate of e-commerce sales. This included over $150,000 crowdfunded by an author under the name Neon Revolt to publish a QAnon book. Also included were $559,000 in bitcoin payments to individuals or organizations that promote extreme right views, according to data from Elliptic, a blockchain analytics firm. Bitcoin payments have reached $17,400 in 2021 so far, Elliptic said.
Amazon confirmed its removal of the QAnon products and declined further comment. EBay and PayPal likewise said they take action against merchants that promote violence per company policies.
The ""de-platforming"" after the Capitol raid and a retreat to less popular forms of payment like bitcoin will severely hamper fundraising, said Imran Ahmed, chief executive of the non-profit Center for Countering Digital Hate.
Since Amazon recently removed 32 items sold by Florida-based MericaWear, its owner Andrew Arnold has considered quitting the business. A black Tee promoting the QAnon conspiracy was a best-seller, and Shopify required takedowns of QAnon goods from MericaWear’s website as well, he said.
""The unfair targeting of MericaWear has proven to be an economic calamity,"" Arnold told Reuters in written statements, estimating $10,000 of losses.
As of Sunday, Reuters was able to prepare orders of Trump hoodies costing $17.76 each with his site. The price reflected the year of the United States' founding.
'RE-MONETIZE'
Others have survived by hunting for new ""unexploited"" platforms such as niche crowdfunding sites before potential bans by mainstream services and payment processors, said Mark Pitcavage, an expert at the Anti-Defamation League who studies right-wing extremism.
Though more rare, Pitcavage said some groups require membership dues to maintain consistent revenue, such as the Oath Keepers militia movement. Several of its members have been criminally charged after the Capitol siege.
Even when far-right personalities are booted off tech platforms, some have turned to alternative technology companies to skirt bans, said Megan Squire, a professor at Elon University who studies online extremism.
For instance, Nicholas Fuentes, a commentator who has voiced anti-Semitic views and hosts a show every weeknight, has used third-party websites including Microsoft Corp's MSFT.O Github to continue live-streaming on various YouTube channels in recent days, despite a ban on his own channel by the Alphabet Inc GOOGL.O streaming service in February, Squire said.
Software from Entropy, which bills itself as ""creative streaming solutions in an era of mass censorship,"" lets Fuentes and other content creators who were blocked from earning money on YouTube continue receiving donations from their videos, Squire said. Entropy's website says it processes the transactions and takes a smaller cut of the money than YouTube does; however, it is unclear how much creators are earning.
When asked about Fuentes' use of Github, the software development platform said in a statement, ""We suspended user accounts ... that replicated activity that had been removed from other platforms for inciting violence.""
Fuentes did not respond to requests for comment through his website, which also marketed ""America First"" merchandise. YouTube said it had terminated multiple accounts trying to stream Fuentes' content, while Entropy representatives did not answer a request for comment.
Squire said she observed Fuentes on YouTube each night this past week, and that YouTube took down the channels after she reported them.
""The game of whack-a-mole continues,"" she said.

2021-01-22 00:00:00+00:00,Etsy Stock Rises 16% In A Week: Will Investors Benefit Further?,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/etsy-stock-rises-16-in-a-week%3A-will-investors-benefit-further-2021-01-22,,,"Etsy’s stock (NASDAQ: ETSY) jumped almost 16.4% in the last one week and currently trades at $204 per share. The rise was potentially in hopes of a multitrillion-dollar stimulus package once Joe Biden becomes president. Further in a recent blog post about Valentine’s Day, Etsy reported multiple positive growth figures around searches in the last three months which also seemed to have boosted the stock price.
According to the Trefis Machine Learning Engine, which identifies trends in a company’s stock price data for the last 20 years, returns for Etsy stock average close to -4.9% in the next one-month (21 trading days) period after experiencing a 23.5% rise over the previous one-week (5 trading days) period.
But how would these numbers change if you are interested in holding Etsy stock for a shorter or a longer time period? You can test the answer and many other combinations on the Trefis Machine Learning to test Etsy stock chances of a rise after a fall and vice-versa. You can test the chance of recovery over different time intervals of a quarter, month, or even 1 day!
MACHINE LEARNING ENGINE – try it yourself:
IF Etsy stock moved by -5% over 5 trading days, THEN over the next 21 trading days, Etsy stock moves up an average of 6.9 percent, which implies an excess return of 3.9 percent compared to the S&P500.
More importantly, there is 62.5% probability of a positive return over the next 21 trading days and 57.8% probability of a positive excess return after a -5% change over 5 trading days.
Some Fun Scenarios, FAQs & Making Sense of Etsy Stock Movements:
Question 1: Is the average return for Etsy stock higher after a drop?
Answer:
Consider two situations,
Case 1: Etsy stock drops by -5% or more in a week
Case 2: Etsy stock rises by 5% or more in a week
Is the average return for Etsy stock higher over the subsequent month after Case 1 or Case 2?
ETSY stock fares better after Case 1, with an average return of 12% over the next month (21 trading days) after Case 1 (where the stock has just suffered a 5% loss over the previous week), versus, an average return of 5.4% after Case 2.
In comparison, the S&P 500 has an average return of 3.1% over the next 21 trading days after Case 1, and an average return of just 0.5% after Case 2 as shown in our dashboard that details the average return for the S&P 500 after a fall or rise.
Try the Trefis machine learning engine above to see for yourself how Etsy stock is likely to behave after any specific gain or loss over a period.
Question 2: Does patience pay?
Answer:
If you buy and hold Etsy stock, the expectation is over time, the near term fluctuations will cancel out, and the long-term positive trend will favor you – if the company is otherwise strong.
Overall, according to data and Trefis machine learning engine’s calculations, patience absolutely pays for most stocks!
For ETSY stock, the returns over the next N days after a -5% change over the last 5 trading days is detailed in the table below, along with the returns for the S&P500:
You can try the engine to see what this table looks like for Etsy after a larger loss over the last week, month, or quarter.
Question 3: What about the average return after a rise if you wait for a while?
Answer:
The average return after a rise is understandably lower than a fall as detailed in the previous question. Interestingly, though, if a stock has gained over the last few days, you would do better to avoid short-term bets for most stocks – although ETSY stock appears to be an exception to this general observation.
ETSY’s returns over the next N days after a 5% change over the last 5 trading days is detailed in the table below, along with the returns for the S&P500:
It’s pretty powerful to test the trend for yourself for Etsy stock by changing the inputs in the charts above.
  While Etsy stock may move, 2020 has created many pricing discontinuities which can offer attractive trading opportunities. For example, you’ll be surprised how counter-intuitive the stock valuation is for Amazon vs Etsy.

2021-01-19 00:00:00+00:00,Making A List Of E-Commerce Stocks To Buy? 3 In Focus,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/making-a-list-of-e-commerce-stocks-to-buy-3-in-focus-2021-01-19,,,"Are These The Top E-Commerce Stocks To Buy This Week?
E-commerce stocks are among the clear benefactors from the coronavirus pandemic on the stock market. While brick-and-mortar stores were forced to close, the e-commerce industry boomed. Because of this, the top e-commerce stocks now have brought monstrous returns for investors. African e-commerce giant Jumia (NYSE: JMIA) is a clear example of this. Similarly, businesses have also flocked to e-commerce facilitators to set up their own systems to accommodate e-shoppers. For example, Shopify (NYSE: SHOP) has and continues to facilitate this massive movement. SHOP stock had one of its best years in the stock market so far with gains of 179% in 2020. In light of these eye-catching figures, it would be natural for investors to question if these trends are here to stay.
Several factors suggest it could just be the beginning of the e-commerce uprising. Firstly, the coronavirus pandemic is still a long way from ending. The logistical nightmare of transporting vaccines in pristine conditions is one that requires resources and time to pull off. Throughout this process, e-commerce will continue to be a vital service that many consumers rely on. Another tailwind for the industry could be in the form of Joe Biden’s $1.9 trillion stimulus package. This would increase the current economic aid to $2000 per person. With stimulus checks in hand, it creates a perfect storm for the best e-commerce stocks to buy in the stock market today.
Taking all this into consideration, I can understand if you are keen to invest in the e-commerce industry. Given its current trajectory, the industry does seem to have plenty of room for growth. Some would even say that as the general population gets familiarized with e-commerce, it could become the new norm. For now, here is a list of the top e-commerce stocks for you to consider adding to your portfolio.

Kaspien Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ: KSPN)
Etsy Inc. (NASDAQ: ETSY)
eBay Inc. (NASDAQ: EBAY)
Kaspien Holdings Inc.
Firstly, Kaspien provides a platform of software and services to help brands grow their online distribution channels on digital marketplaces. The company plays an important role as the online growth partner of brands. Therefore, it is not surprising that KSPN stock has attracted investors’ attention. Similarly, the company’s shares reflect this as it is seeing gains of over 1100% in the past year. With such impressive gains, could there be more room for it to grow?  
In its recent quarter fiscal reported last month, the company saw a 35% rise in total revenue year-over-year. This amounts to a total of $38.91 million for the quarter. On top of that, the company also ended the quarter with $2.4 million in cash on hand. Kaspien also saw a phenomenal 127% year-over-year increase in gross merchandise value. Understandably, as more businesses turn to the company to bolster their e-commerce infrastructure, this would be the case. Should Kaspien be able to scale its core business to meet rising demands, KSPN stockholders could be in for a treat.
In recent news, the company announced a new partnership with Levin Consulting. The partnership with Levin will be focused on providing consumer brands with omnichannel sales strategies and services. The omnichannel aspect of this partnership is important as it provides an integrated service for clients that encompasses online and physical marketplaces. In theory, Kaspien and Levin will be servicing each other’s clients. Kaspien customers would be able to access Levin’s industry-leading strategy consultations. Despite its fantastic performance last year, Kaspien appears to be maintaining its momentum. Could this spell big gains for KSPN stock in the next few months? That remains to be seen.

Etsy Inc.
Another top e-commerce stock in focus now would be Etsy. The company mainly operates via its proprietary e-commerce website which offers handmade or vintage items and craft supplies. Considering how its wares cater to the needs of consumers at home, the company has thrived throughout the pandemic. To point out, ETSY stock has quadrupled in value over the past year. It even jumped by over 11% during last week’s trading session. Incoming stimulus package aside, this could be related to its recent search result figures post.
Last week, the company wrote in a blog post about its Valentine’s Day search statistics. The company’s search figures indicate that demand for its wares is still going strong over these last three months. Most impressive of all searches for DIY cocktail kits skyrocketed by over 1,183%. This was followed by a 165% increase in searches for food-related DIY kits. Evidently, people are turning to Etsy for their home entertainment and hobby-related needs more than ever. With this in mind, I’m not surprised to see investors flocking to ETSY stock.
It is great that people are turning to Etsy more in these times. But, the company will also need the proper funds to facilitate and scale its business accordingly. On this matter, the company seems to be doing alright as well. Etsy saw green across the board in its third-quarter fiscal reported in October. This includes year-over-year leaps of 128% in total revenue and a 519% rise in net income. All this coupled with cash on hand of $1.14 billion should set the company up for the long run. After considering all this, will you be adding ETSY stock to your watchlist?

eBay Inc.
Third, we will be looking at e-commerce veteran eBay. Similar to our previous entries, the company had a fantastic year on the stock market due to coronavirus-related tailwinds. As more people turned to e-commerce, the company saw an influx of buyers and sellers throughout the year. Paired with the company’s efforts to streamline its business, eBay has come out as one of the winners of 2020. This is clear as EBAY stock is up by over 100% since the March lows. Based on its latest announcement, investors could be watching it even more closely.
Over the long weekend, the company announced that it will take up managing payments for sellers in Greater China. This is a fantastic play by eBay as it works towards modernizing and streamlining its customer experience. With this, the company is providing buyers with more flexibility in terms of payment. Additionally, sellers will have one less thing to worry about on their end. In the bigger picture, this could contribute to the overall buyer and seller growth in its marketplace. Clearly, eBay has no plans to fall behind amidst the current e-commerce trends.
Furthermore, the company appears to have healthy financials as its foundation as well. eBay raked in $2.61 billion in total revenue and saw a 114% year-over-year rise in net income. Investors were likely pleased to see that there was a 154% rise in earnings per share over the same period as well. To highlight, it reported having 183 million global active buyers back in October. eBay’s latest play indicates that it is still looking to grow that number. Should things go as planned, do you see EBAY stock hitting new all-time highs this year?

Dylan Lewis: Awesome. All right. It's Friday, Jan. 8, and we are talking about the top tech stocks for 2021. I'm your host, Dylan Lewis, and I'm joined by fool.com's tenacious, trusted, treasure trove of tip top tongue-twister titles, Brian Feroldi. Brian, how are you doing?
Brian Feroldi: Dylan, you're starting off the new year with nailing my title yet again, but it is good to see you, my friend.
Lewis: Well, I had some encouragement. I was delighted to get the Feroldi family holiday card over the course of December and that just reminded me I've got to stay on top of my game. We took a couple of weeks off there, but I'm not sleeping. I'm still doing my tongue-twisters even if we're not airing.
Feroldi: It is going to be, I think, three weeks since we had a Friday where we could do Industry Focus, so awesome to be back.
Lewis: In some ways, it was nice to get the break but I've got to say, I'm ready. We've been planning, we've got a killer show, I'm really excited. We are going to be talking about the top tech stocks for us for 2021 in terms of what we see out there, and what we're interested in, and put some money behind. We're also going to be talking a little bit about the year that was with 2020 in both our biggest winners and some of our biggest regrets. Loved this, though. We've had a week of people from Industry Focus pitching their top tech shares. We're giving people a nice, well-rounded basket of stocks for 2021, all the sectors represented, Brian.
Feroldi: I think it's a great idea and of course, we couldn't finish out this week without talking about some tech stocks, because tech was, once again, the sector to be in in 2020.
Lewis: It was. I don't know about you, I'm someone that is heavily, heavily overweight tech. I figure, you know what, I'm a little bit more balanced when it comes to the stuff in my 401(k) and some of my retirement accounts. My personal brokerage account, I can be a little bit more focused. I can invest individually in stocks that I follow and understand more, and take a little bit more risks. Because of that, my portfolio did pretty well in 2020. Brian, how about you?
Feroldi: I'm not a big believer that you have to own stocks from every sector. My personal strategy is to own as many awesome companies as I can and as few terrible ones that I can. There's a lot of awesome tech stock, so I, like you, I'm very exposed to the sector.
Lewis: I think owning a few terrible companies is possible. It's just a great mission statement here for your portfolio.
Feroldi: Easier said than done.
Lewis: But that's the beauty of being an individual stock picker, because you get to choose. In my case, because of being over way tech, and because the beauty of the Fool community and the Fool universe, had a lot of really great winners myself in 2020; to give a couple names and some shine there, DocuSign, MercadoLibre, Square, all multibagger of years for me. I think businesses across the board that saw really big step changes in trends that we're already going to be benefiting them. And boom, just to the next level, adoption skyrocketed. I know the same. It's probably true for stuff you are on, Brian.
Feroldi: That's exactly what we saw in 2020. If you had a positive trend in your favor prior to 2020, the odds are pretty good, it got sped up and your stock price went above bananas. If you had a headwind in 2020, the odds are pretty good that your stock got smashed. Since I tend to invest in companies that I think can grow for a long period of time, I had a lot of winners in my portfolio. For me, my absolute biggest winner, it wasn't even close, it was Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA). I've been invested in Tesla since 2013 or 2012, a long time, and I've added along the way. Tesla putting up a 734% return in 2020, that's certainly boosted my portfolio.
Lewis: Brian, we've talked about it on the show before, but there are folks out there that are listening, that are Tesla shareholders, and they're happy right alongside you. There are probably some people that feel like they miss the boat. I can represent that side of things when it comes to Tesla. I think I had a basis of about 200 pre-split and around the private takeout point had hit my limit and wound up selling. It's hard to look at those gains and say, ""Man, the opportunity costs and what I wanted to do with that money instead."" But if I'm being honest, I think if I had held on, I would've been right for the wrong reason. I don't think it would've been aligned with what I saw happening. It's a regret in a way, but I think ultimately, I was true to what I wanted there.
Feroldi: That's perfectly fine. You don't have to own every big winner to do well, and there are lots of companies that you just shouldn't own. If there's any company in the universe that is easy to have a wrong opinion on, it is Tesla. Yes, no shame in selling or taking a pass on Tesla altogether.
Lewis: I like your philosophy there, not having to own all of them. Because you take that step back and you look at your overall portfolio performance. If you're outperforming the S&P 500, you're beating most people. If you could take that step back and see great returns, and thankfully, I was in that position for 2020, then it makes it a little easier to swallow some of those huge winners that you don't have a ticket to. But the reality is there are a lot of really great winners in the Fool universe, and I'm lucky enough to own several of them.
Feroldi: I think you said something that's really worth double-clicking on. How did your portfolio do versus whatever benchmark you are measuring? Whatever you would be invested in if you weren't stock picking. Stock picking is wonderful, it's super fun, it's highly engaging, but if you are stock picking and you are not outperforming indexes over lengthy periods of time, you're doing extra work to be less wealthy. So, make sure you measure your returns against a benchmark.
Lewis: Yeah, and I will say, if you're using the S&P 500, use the total return. There are some people that just look at the price return. Look at the total return, don't slight yourself there. Make sure that you're holding yourself accountable because there will be an extra 1% or 2% there, because of the dividends being reinvested.
Feroldi: That's a good point though.
Lewis: I dared my soul a little bit with Tesla, Brian. When it comes to the past year, what do you personally have a regret with when you look at your portfolio or some of the decisions that you made?
Feroldi: It's really easy to look backwards in time and play the ""woulda, shoulda, coulda"" game. It's not that hard to look back and say, ""Wow, Wayfair is like a 20-bagger off of its low. I really should have put all my money into Wayfair in March; because of course, it wasn't going to disappear. Of course, home furnishing was going to take off immediately after that."" That's not a very useful exercise because would you have made that decision in real-time with the information that you had at the time? I don't like to look backwards and say, ""I did this wrong. I did that wrong."" I think it's OK to look back, see what happened, and see if you can learn the lessons from them that you can apply forward. But I don't really have any big regrets. But for the sake of saying something, I do remember the day that Pinterest (NYSE: PINS) hit $10 per share, and I said, ""That makes no sense."" That price makes no sense. This is a very high-quality business, I think it can grow for a long period of time. That was pretty much the low. When I said that to myself, I should've been quiet about it on Motley Fool Live and bought like crazy.
Lewis: That's one of the things of what we do. Because we talked about businesses so often, we have our trading rules in place here at The Fool that can occasionally lock us out from buying something that we might be very, very interested in doing. But it's important. We think that that's a really valuable element of what we do here. I will say, Brian, I went through that Fool arc of having a couple winners that I missed out on, and had the teachable moment for myself from it. I think what's hard and maybe what might be helpful for listeners is, we talk all the time about getting skin in the game on something that you want to own. Even as someone who says it a lot, I still don't always manage to do it. There are two businesses in particular with 2020. One of them, Datadog and another one's Zoom, where I remember doing the S-1 shows on those companies. I remember loving everything about them. They were just compelling, best-in-class companies, great retention rates, checked all the boxes, the valuation spooked me. Ultimately, that's what scared me off from getting a start-up position. I think my teachable moment for myself with 2020 is particularly if it's at first position. Just take a small bite; I say it all the time, but just take a small bite. The difference between having sold your brokerage account and tracking it, and not having it is huge in terms of how much you pay attention to it.
Feroldi: I think that's a wonderful lesson, but that is an incredibly hard lesson to internalize. If you like everything but the price is just insane, it's awfully hard to buy if you have any valuation vent at all. For example, what about Snowflake today? Seems like a really great business, will you pay 200 times sales for a company that's worth $100 billion plus? Boy, is that really hard to do. The good news is, if you really like Zoom, that stock has been falling drastically, so you might have another chance, Dylan.
Lewis: Hey, you never know when the discounts are going to come. Things go on sale when you don't expect them to.
Feroldi: That's right. But I do like the general point that you're making. If a company checks a lot of boxes for you, just get a little bit of skin in the game to put it on your radar and hope that the price declines, you can add your positioning over time.
Lewis: I think the reason I'm harping on that a little bit for myself is you have your watch list, and in my case, it's a physical list, sometimes it's a digital list in a Google Drive folder or something like that. But I tend to revisit that list when I have cash, just as a matter of the investing process. What I noticed is I'm far more in tune with what I own. I want to check my brokerage company pretty much daily. It's a lot easier for me to spot opportunities in stuff that I own or see success in stuff that I own, just because I'm regularly in the routine of checking that. I'm not so frequently checking my watch list and updating it, which is another lesson, I think, for me. If you're only putting a small amount of money toward it, there's nothing wrong with really liking everything and then being like, you know what? It's got to grow into this valuation. But as we saw, the stuff changes can happen, Brian, and then the valuation could start making a lot more sense.
Feroldi: It's very, very difficult to do that with you, Dylan. Yes, I have made that mistake and I can guarantee I will make that mistake constantly for the rest of my investing career.
Lewis: Listeners, you'll hear us doing this show on Snowflake in exactly one years' time. Brian, you talked about your regret being Pinterest. I feel like that's a half regret because as it turns out, you did wind up having a position in the stock. If I'm not mistaken, it's your stock for 2021?
Feroldi: That is correct. When I looked at my portfolio, I was like, what stock has done really well that I think is going to be permanently benefited because of COVID? I just came back to Pinterest. While the stock has done extremely well in 2020, I still think the growth story here is just getting started. When I look back at the most recent numbers we have to work off, it is the third quarter. Pinterest reported 37% growth in users and this is at a pretty decent scale. They're at 442 million users with the bulk of that growth coming in international markets. So, about two-thirds or three-quarters of their users are in international markets. Pinterest said that they're seeing particular growth from users under age 25. That's really attractive to me, because that is where advertisers want to put their dollars behind and overtime, the purchasing power of that cohort will certainly grow.
Beyond just the growing user numbers, which I think were boosted heavily from COVID, Pinterest also rolled out a number of tools during the year that are really going to make its platform much more attractive for advertisers as well as for posters. They made a big push into video. My wife is a heavy Pinterest user and she absolutely says, ""I've seen tons more videos on the sites than I ever have before."" They also launched an automatic bidding future for advertisers, they launched this product in July. In the third quarter, it already represented half of the company's conversion revenue. Talk about success with a product that easy. It's clear that those tools are very, very useful for advertisers.
The reason I'm so bullish on Pinterest easing from up here though has to do with ARPU, average revenue per user. Pinterest is so early in its monetization efforts. In the third quarter, it pulled in on average $1.03 off of the average user on its platform. For comparison, Facebook in the same period, $7.90. Facebook is pulling in more than seven times the revenue per user. Now, Facebook has been monetizing for much longer, it has a lot more data. But I think that the drumbeat away from Facebook and Twitter, is just going to get louder and louder, and Pinterest doesn't have to deal with any of those problems. I think, between the growing user base, as well as the company's continued monetization efforts, the next +10 years, we'll see double-digit growth for this company.
Lewis: Yeah, I think that ARPU comparison is probably one of the most succinct and compelling thesis you can have on a company. If you think Pinterest is going to ultimately grow to match the worst most prevalent social media company, that means that they still have a 2.5X on their current ARPU. Right?
Feroldi: Exactly. As they roll out the tools, to me, the big thing is that they're not plagued with any of the negativity that many other platforms are. I've seen the power of the platform in real-time, where my wife goes on, she looks at some image she's liked and she is like, what about this, and it's like, OK yeah, that makes sense for our life, let's buy that thing. I think that a lot of users are going to do that exact same journey.
Lewis: Yeah, I'm interested in that growth in the age under-25 element, Brian, because I think that that's a little bit of like a narrative shifting data point for a platform like Pinterest. When we talk about accessing the -- I guess, is that Gen-Z, sub-25? Is that the market we're talking about?
Feroldi: Sure, you've sold me. It's Gen-Z.
Lewis: People under 25. We're going to leave it at that, so I don't step at it and say something that's the wrong label. But for that market, typically we're talking about Instagram, and for a long time, it was Snapchat as the go-to way for advertisers to access that market. If they're able to really build themselves as someone that can offer advertisers access there, that's another major selling point for them as they go out to advertisers.
Feroldi: I think that's completely right. And again, why do people go to Pinterest? Back it up. Why do people go to Facebook? People go to Facebook to connect with and see photos of their friends and family. Why do people go to Twitter? To communicate with each other. Why do people go to Pinterest? To see images that will inspire them to do something in their life. Of those three, I think that Pinterest is the most natural place to go for advertising. They called this outright in their S-1. Advertisements do not compete with native content, advertising is the native content. Not only do I think that there's room for Pinterest to grow its ARPU, to match Facebook overtime, it would not shock me if in time they eclipse Facebook.
Lewis: Yeah. Advertisements that naturally fit into native content is basically the advertiser's dream. We see that in written content, in video content all the time. I think that the closer and closer you can get to that in the way that it doesn't feel intrusive on the consuming experience, the better. The other thing, and listeners may be able to figure this out by now, I don't own Pinterest, but it is basically in the top three on my ""2020, Dylan, get a stake in this company"" list. One of the other things that is just so compelling to me is the automatic bidding process because that gives you scale. That is one of those things that if you are running a platform, you need advertisers to be able to participate at scale,and then you see numbers start really taking off. The fact that they are early on in that means that these numbers are probably going to start getting big pretty quickly in the following years.
Feroldi: Let's remember, last quarter revenue growth, 58%, gross margin expanded 400 basis points to 75%, so that's almost 60% top-line growth combined with a gross margin of 75%. They have crossed into the profitability on an adjusted basis, they have tons of stock-based compensation, which is dragging them down. But even though the stock has gone up a lot in 2020, the valuation to me is not insane. It's high, but it's not insane. 29 times sales. But more importantly, because they're now focused on producing non-GAAP earnings, they're trading at less than 100 times next year's earnings estimates. That's a high number, very high number, but given that I think that there is operating leverage ahead, and there's huge room for them to grow their top-line. I don't think it's crazy.
Lewis: I think it's helpful to take that valuation and not just look at it as a multiple on earnings or sales, but look at it overall and how it stacks up to some other social media companies. We're talking about a business that's worth just over $40 billion. For a social media business, a digitally scalable business, that is not that big. It really isn't. When you factor in the ad load coming, them getting better and better about bringing advertisers in, there's a lot to like and it's not very hard to see this business being multiples bigger five years from now.
Feroldi: To your point, Facebook is worth $755 billion and I still think that number is going to go up too, by the way. I could very easily see Facebook being a $1 trillion company someday. So yes, I don't think Pinterest will ever match Facebook's size and scale, but is there room for it to grow between $40 billion and $800 billion? I think so.
Lewis: Yeah, I think them being a $100+ billion company in five-years is not hard to forecast. If everything goes according to plan and the thesis plays out, that's a relatively easy thing to see. That's what we like, right, Brian? We like easy, we don't like hard.
Feroldi: I look forward to you joining me as a shareholder, Dylan.
Lewis: I will let you know when it happens. For me, for my top stock, I have two, because I don't want to short change folks. I did wind up pitching a business when we did our all host round table that aired on December 23rd. To give people a quick recap on that. Beautifully, Brian, this is a company that you are familiar with, so we can kick this one around a little bit. But for folks that listened to that episode you heard me talk about Axon (NASDAQ: AAXN). I think that was my stock basically for the next year. But I think just in general, wonderful business. For the folks that are not super familiar, it's the company that's formerly known as TASER, they rebranded to reflect the fact that they are focused on their Axon body cameras and the Evidence.com cloud storage business. The short thesis here is basically that they supply body cameras that you see law enforcement wearing, and when it comes to that market, Brian, they are basically the only game in town. They're the only ones there.
Feroldi: That's correct. They have as strong a competitive position as you can have in a market. I believe they got there and the body camera by both organically and through acquisition, if memory serves.
Lewis: I think that's right, yeah. You're getting to the deeper sensors in my brain there. But really, this went from being something that was a tiny portion of their business, and really something that had to play out over time to what we have seen become a very large contributor to revenue. What I like is we've seen the thesis materialize. Axon cloud grew 40% in 2019, the sensors grew 60% in 2019. Management sees margin expansion across the board in all of its major segments. I think the body camera and the cloud storage is only going to become a larger part of this company going forward. From the investing side, that's high-margin revenue on the cloud side. These are recurring revenue cycles for them. They have customers that are going to be locked in for a long time, and they're the only player in this space, which you love. You love to see that. I think importantly, Brian, for me with this one, it's a really easy company to get behind. I'm going to highlight three points from the mission slide of their most recent earnings presentation. One, obsolete the bullet. Two, reduce social conflict. Three, enable a fair and effective justice system. Really, when I look at a company like Axon, what they're trying to do, they're trying to save lives, carry out more fair and equitable justice, and they are trying to add accountability and provide an unbiased record of what happens when things happen. I think as long as it's good for civilians, it's good for law enforcement. It's just a win-win all around.
Feroldi: I like to look at the softer side of investing things, and Axon here is one of Brian Stoffel's biggest holdings and investments. One of the reasons why is because it probably has the best mission statement I've ever heard, which is to protect life. Three words, ridiculously inspirational, very simple, and that is what the company is hyper-focused on. Now, that's all great and I do like to chat about the body camera business. To me, what makes it such a compelling investment is the software. The software that underpins it all, and how much emphasis that they are putting on getting that software into police offices. Once the software is in there, and it works seamlessly with the hardware that goes in there, that creates a product ecosystem that, to me, just reminds me of Apple. It's no stretch I think to call this company, the Apple of law enforcement.
Lewis: Yeah. The reason I wanted to pitch one Brian, is I think there are probably a lot of folks out there that look at the tax base and are really scared of some of the valuations that they're seeing right now. There are a variety of reasons why the multiples have been expanded for a lot of these companies. We're seeing SaaS companies that have recurring revenue, very high-margin revenue coming in, and we're trying to figure out how to value them. But also, there's really not a lot of money to be made in putting money into debt. There's a lot of money going into the stock market, a lot of money going into real estate. I look at this company and I say, there are a lot of elements of it that are exactly what you want in a tech business. You have high-margin revenue coming in, it's really sticky. What I really like in their case though, is this is something that law enforcement needs to have. They are basically installed with who they already have relationships with. They're not going anywhere, and they're only really going to be adding customers. I don't see this going away. Really, no matter what happens, it's I think it's the new normal. That's good for a lot of people. But I think on the investing side, it means that yes, there are elements of this that are tech, but this is a much more stable tech investment than a lot of things we normally talk about on the show.
Feroldi: Yep, I think margins are going to grow too as their software offering gets out there and becomes more popular. This is a company that purposely was profitable, and then went backwards as it invested aggressively to both develop its software capabilities and get them out there into police offices for, I think, free for the first year or something like that. They knew that once police offices gave this product a try that they were going to become heavily reliant on it. It's a strategy that I think over the next five years will produce huge growth in earnings.
Lewis: Since I pitched that one already, Brian, I want to give some folks that are listening something new as well. I feel like it's only fair. I will add another one, and we're talking up our own book here Brian, because you own Pinterest. I will be a shareholder when I'm able to be a shareholder, I already own Axon, and this third company I'm going to name, I own, I believe you might own it as well, and that is MercadoLibre (NASDAQ: MELI). We talked about it briefly before being a huge winner in 2020. It has been a huge winner, basically, no matter how far back you look, I don't see that ending anytime soon.
Feroldi: Tesla is my No. 1 holding. My No. 2 holding, Dylan, is MercadoLibre, if that gives you [laughs] any sense of what I think about the long-term potential of the business.
Lewis: Yeah. It's my largest holding. Some of that is me putting the money behind it, but a huge chunk of that is really just the share price appreciation, the fact that the business has continued to execute. There are a few companies that I think benefit from as many mega trends as MercadoLibre does. It is so squarely positioned behind e-commerce, digital payments, fintech, and that space is absolutely exploding. I think what is particularly incredible about this business is they operate in fragmented markets in South America, that insulates them a lot from competitive pressure. What we're seeing with them, when we talk a little bit of Mercado Pago, their payment solution, is they've created things that are being used within their ecosystem, but they have also made the leap to being used off of their ecosystem and have basically become the way that people transact without traditional financial systems.
Feroldi: To me, MercadoLibre is a case study in the power of optionality. When I first became aware of this business, it was pretty much the eBay of Latin America and that's it. You could make a very compelling argument today that this company is the PayPal of Latin America with an eBay ticker to it. Not only that, but they have invested heavily in the logistics side of their platform and they are even getting into the asset management business. This company has proven itself to be incredibly innovative to roll out new products and services and it is winning everywhere that it goes.
Lewis: I think even calling it the PayPal, you're selling it short, Brian. It's basically, you take eBay, you take Amazon, you take PayPal, throw Square in there. There are so many different services that it is able to bundle up in a really effective way. That, to me, is just a very easy investing case. We've seen this model work. We're seeing it now being applied to a different market, and we talked a little bit before about the businesses that 2020 created step changes for. The numbers for this company got huge in 2020, just put a couple of numbers to do that: in Q3 of 2019, companies saw year-over-year gross merchandise volume of $3.6 billion, which was a 21.6% increase in U.S. dollars, 37% increase if you're neutral on foreign exchange. Q3 of 2020, a year later, gross merchandise volume almost $6 billion, an increase of 62% in U.S. dollars and 117% on an FX neutral basis. Items sold over 200 million for the most recent quarter that we have data on, double what it was a year ago. It doesn't really matter what core business metric you look at, everything went off in 2020. I look at this and I say it's a business that was already experiencing adoption, Brian. I think those are people who are probably going to be here to stay.
Feroldi: Well, I would have to agree with you there. If you want to go really exciting, despite this company being one of the biggest winners in the market over the last 10 years and having been a monster, I think multi-hundred bagger, since coming public, it's an $84 billion business. It hasn't even crossed the $100 billion mark. Again, with companies like Amazon, well over $1 trillion, I think there's upside here too.
Lewis: Yeah. I look at this and I say, it's easy. It's really easy to see this company being much bigger in three years, five years, 10 years. I don't see a lot that's going to disrupt the thesis. It's nice to be able to have short parts, Brian. That's what we're looking for here.
Feroldi: That's right. Now, the valuation is pretty darn high. It wouldn't surprise me if the stock traded sideways for a couple of years while the fundamentals caught up to the valuation. But like you, I think five years from now, 10 years from now, this company will be bigger.
Lewis: Yeah. The necessary caveat, I always have to add this when we talk about MercadoLibre, I mentioned before, they do business in fragment markets, they're in I think over a dozen countries in South America. They have to take results that are reported in a bunch of different currencies and then basically repatriate them, state them in U.S. dollars, and because of that, a lot of crazy things can happen with currency swings and what that actually reflects in their financials. If you're looking at things on a U.S. dollar reported basis, there are going to be some weird times, particularly as there is some volatility in some of the markets they operate in. This is a business where you have to look, I think, at the key business metrics and really follow those to get a sense of what is going on. As long as those continue to post insane growth, which they have, I am going to be a long-term ball on this business.
Feroldi: The interesting thing there, Dylan, is the currency movements have worked against this company heavily for as long as I've been following them, at least five years. Currencies tend to ebb and flow, and there might be a day when currency movements actually work in this company's favor. Imagine what it could do if currency all of a sudden became a reason to own this stock.
Lewis: Yeah. You talked about the last five years, Brian. In that period, it's been a 15%, 100% winner. Something roughly in that neighborhood. Despite operating in a very tough economic environment during that period, it has proven to be a very strong business. It's my largest holdings, it's one of Brian's largest holdings. I know a lot of Fools are huge fans. But I know a lot of the names we threw out here, Brian, are ones that are very popular in the Fool universe. I think if you looked around, if we were at HQ, rather than doing this virtually, you would find a lot of fans for all of these businesses.
Feroldi: Importantly, the biggest lesson I've learned in investing is that winners keep on winning. All the companies that we've talked about thus far have been winners and I would personally bet that all of them are going to keep on winning.
Lewis: Yeah. That's a great way to end this on, Brian, because I'm sure a lot of folks look at the stock price charts for these companies and say, oh, come on, you're telling me to pick up shares of this thing? Yeah, I've said that pretty much every time I've bought back into Axon and MercadoLibre. I'm sure in three or five years from now, I'll be saying that when I buy back into Pinterest, again. [laughs]
Feroldi: Enough, Dylan. Yes, it is extremely mentally difficult to buy something like Pinterest. Pinterest is $70 today. As I said, nine months ago, this company was trading at $10. I said, wow, that just makes no sense. It's incredibly hard to say, ""I'm going to buy this thing at $70 today, but I could have bought nine months ago at $10."" But you have to be willing to do that if you want to buy into the best growth stocks.
Lewis: It's part of the mindset when it comes to investing, it's just what you have to suffer through. But when you look at the returns, it makes it worth the anguish, I think.
Feroldi: I think that's right, Dylan.
Lewis: Just quickly to recap our tech stocks for 2021. We got Pinterest, we have Axon, we have MercadoLibre. I think we can say collectively, we have a high degree of conviction in all three of those, just based on the fact that we've got skin in the game on two out of three, soon to be three out of three for both of us.
Feroldi: I own all three, Dylan, so you can catch up anytime you would like.
Lewis: I was saying ""we,"" Brian. I was saying ""we."" [laughs] Because this is a theme week, I just want to quickly recap what we had earlier in the week. Matt Frankel pitched Wells Fargo on Monday. On the Consumer Goods show on Tuesday, Asit Sharma pitched Sleep Number, and Emily Flippen pitched Airbnb. On Wildcard Wednesday, we had Brendan Matthews with Workday, and Jason Moser with Masimo, and then Energy, oh my gosh, these guys went crazy. We had Jason Hall pitching Brookfield Infrastructure Partners, you can tell I don't say that name a lot, BIP, and Nick Sciple pitching Berkshire Hathaway and NV5 and Texas Pacific Land. A lot of names there, Brian. I think that's going to be a fun basket to track in 2021.
Feroldi: That's a motley group of stocks and we would have no other way, right?
Lewis: Absolutely. That's the beauty of the show because we talk about every sector of the stock market, get a little exposure to everything. Brian, so great to be back with you. Happy to be in 2021, happy to be back on the podcasts routine.
Feroldi: I'm thrilled to be here, Dylan.
Lewis: Thanks for joining me.
Feroldi: You too, buddy.

2021-01-14 00:00:00+00:00,Petco and Poshmark Are 2 New IPOs That Begin Trading Today,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/petco-and-poshmark-are-2-new-ipos-that-begin-trading-today-2021-01-14,,,"Two new stocks will begin trading today: pet care leader Petco Health & Wellness (NASDAQ: WOOF) and online used-clothing marketplace Poshmark (NASDAQ: POSH). Both companies priced their offerings above expectations, indicating the IPO boom still has legs.
Barking up the right tree
This is Petco's third trip to the public markets, though it's been 15 years since investors were last able to trade the stock.
The pet supplies retailer operates over 1,500 stores in the U.S., Puerto Rico, and Mexico, offering pet care products, veterinary services, an online store, and online health advice called PetCoach.

Through the end of October, it notched over $3.5 billion in revenue, up 9% year over year, on a 9.6% jump in comparable store sales.
Petco priced its 48 million share offering of Class A stock at $18 per share, beating the $14 to $17 per share expected range for the IPO. Petco also granted the underwriters a 30-day option to purchase an additional 7.2 million shares.
Smart sense of fashion
Poshmark is new to the public markets. It was supposed to IPO well over a year ago, but pulled the offering as the markets turned a cold shoulder to all the fashion retailers that went public at the time, such as Farfetch, Levi Strauss, and StitchFix.
Poshmark priced its latest offering at $42 a share, ahead of the $35 to $39 range forecast, as e-commerce during the global pandemic took off.
The fashion site isn't a retailer, but rather a marketplace like eBay where other members can sell their goods. It generated $192.8 million in revenue through September, up 28% from the previous year, according to its IPO filing.
Petco will trade under the ticker WOOF; Poshmark under POSH. Both will be on the Nasdaq exchange.

This video was recorded on January 5, 2021.
David Gardner: What's the worst investment you've ever made? The worst? Did you lose 100%? I sure hope you didn't do worse than that. I mean, the only way to do worse than that is to borrow money that you didn't have and then lose all of that. Well, as many losers as I've had and as used to losing as I am, I've still never picked a stock for The Motley Fool that went down 100%, but I've come close. This time, every year, once a year, I talk about my worst stock picks, my biggest losers over the past three years. If winners win, losers lose and it's important to talk about both. So, come with me, won't you? To the dark side, the shadow side, the losing side. Let's explore and learn today on my annual David's Biggest Losers Volume Six. Only on this week's Rule Breaker Investing.
Welcome back to Rule Breaker Investing. Happy New Year! I sure hope I'm not the first one to wish you Happy New Year, but if I am, you're probably pretty locked down. Thanks for finding me. Thanks for finding me on the one podcast that I hate doing every year. Yeah, it's my biggest losers. Looking at the six worst stocks I've picked over the last three years. I was googling David's Biggest Losers. You can google the phrase, go ahead, ""David's Biggest Losers"". We ranked top across the entire internet for that phrase. In fact, shows from the last few years dominate Google for that phrase. We are smoking the television show Biggest Loser in this search engine optimization battle. You have to go down to the fifth search result after Googling ""David's Biggest Losers"" before you get to a link to the Biggest Losers television show Wiki located at the site Fandom where there's a page dedicated to David Lee, who appeared on the show's seventh season which was 2009, who started that season show with a body mass index, wow, of 53.3. The record will show it says he was sent home in week one, he was eliminated in week four. Which may have you thinking, ""Hey Dave, actually, the competition for the phrase 'David's Biggest Losers' on the internet isn't really much of a competition,'"" and I guess I'd have to agree with you. Yep, it looks like right now I own the phrase, I don't really want to, ""David's Biggest Losers,"" and here we are.
This is volume six. Yeah, we've done this every year, the podcast has existed and this is volume six. Now I'm putting in mind one of my favorite Shakespeare quotes, which comes from the play the Motley Fool's name was pulled from, and that would be, ''As you like it.'' This one is from Act four, Scene one of As you like it, ''I had rather have a fool to make me merry than experience to make me sad.'' Well, we're going to be talking about some sad experiences this week, but I'll be joined by two of my favorite Fools to maybe add some merriment, make me feel better anyway. I'll be making you feel merry, won't I? Because isn't it kind of fun to watch a professional, let's say an NBA player just air-ball it 10 times in a row up the free throw line? I mean, it's fun to watch isn't it? Cars crash, NASCAR. Isn't that why people are watching? It's fun to watch people screw up. Bloopers. America's funniest home videos, that's what this show is all about. David's Biggest Losers, Volume Six.
Now, I'm cognizant that these are stocks that I've recommended and you may own them. A lot of people do. So, I don't want to make too much light of it because it's a bummer to lose. But the good news is that we continue to give out more winners that win bigger than our losers lose. It's funny. I don't actually dedicate any podcast, all 52 weeks of every year here to my biggest winners. I've never done that. But I do like to celebrate our biggest losers once a year. So, thank you for joining in. All right. Well, without further ado, let's go right at it. My six worst stock picks of the last three years, and I always like to start with the very worst. It's somewhat ironic because one of my very best friends at The Motley Fool is Rick Munarriz, my longtime friend and co-analyst here at The Motley Fool. Rick, welcome.
Rick Munarriz: Thank you. Thank you, David. I'm sorry to be here for this sad occasion, but I think we learn a lot from our losers. So, it's good that you're doing this and I'm honored to be talking about the bad, ugly stuff.
Gardner: Well, a year ago for David's Biggest Losers Volume Five, you did a wonderful job presenting. So I thought, I've got to have him back, and let me give him the three worst this year. So you've graciously accepted this mission. You've gone back and looked at each of these three companies, we'll do the worst one first in a sec. But let me mention, Rick has prepared for each of these two reasons why things have gone badly and one reason for hope. Some glimmers for each of these. So Rick, before we get started, could you briefly introduce yourself and maybe say one of your earliest memories of The Motley Fool on AOL Keyword 'Fool' back in the day.
Munarriz: Wow, OK. So I've been with the Motley Fool since 1995. Definitely back in the AOL Keyword Fool days, eventually as MFEdibles when I was brought into the fold in 1995. My original name was AristotleM@AOL.com, then we all adopted MFEdibles and TMFEdibles, and now, of course, TMFBreakerRick, because who wouldn't want a Rule Breaker name in their handle. So yeah, but one of my earliest memories, again, I live in Florida, so I was one of the people that grew up as you guys slowly grew to form there in the DC area. But I mean, I remember going to Virginia at least once a year, every other year, and every time it seemed like the office had more and more people in the office, the office space had to get bigger, you had to move in. So, I watched this gradual growth that maybe you day-by-day, David, didn't notice, but I as an annual visitor came in and just sat, ""Wow, so much has changed and improved and grown over the time.""
Gardner: Well, you've done a wonderful job, you've brought so many great stocks to the attention of so many Rule Breaker members. Indeed Rick, since you are one of our most published authors every day at Fool.com, just covering what's happening on the market, I thought it was totally appropriate to invite you in to talk about these three companies. Now, two of them are in fact Motley Fool Rule Breaker picks, and one of them is a Motley Fool Stock Advisor pick. But let's stop beating around the bush and go right at it. So, my very worst stock pick in the last three years was picked three years ago this month. Because for David's Biggest Losers every year I just look back three years, this is the last time I'll have to talk about this one, because it will cycle out by 2022. But here we are, Rick, the date was January 24th, 2018, AnaptysBio (NASDAQ: ANAB), ticker symbol A-N-A-B, was trading at $116.91 a share that day as I presented it to Rule Breaker members, I'm really horrified to admit it's present trading price, Rick, as we record here on Tuesday afternoon, January 5th, AnaptysBio has gone from $116.91 to $24.34, that is a loss of 79.1%. That is my worst stock pick of the last three years. Rick, thing No. 1 that hasn't gone so well for ticker symbol ANAB.
Munarriz: Yes, of course, AnaptysBio, as you can tell by the name, is a biotech. When you're talking about biotech, you live and die by these clinical trials, especially for these early stage biotech companies. In this case, AnaptysBio, there was one day, November 8th, 2019 that will live in basically the infamy of its shareholders, when the stock took a 72% hit in a single day after, let me see if I get this drug right, because I'm not Karl Thiel, who should be pronouncing these, Etokimab. It almost sounds like a Pokemon, but it's basically, it was an experimental treatment for an antibody, and it was a treatment for eczema, and it was going to treat other things, but the treatment for eczema flopped in a critical Phase II study. On any given day when you look at the daily markets, winners or losers, you're going to see biotech's winners and biotech's losers, because that's how it is. You have a lot riding on these three phases of clinical trials, and there was a lot banking on basically this antibody to be basically helping patients with eczema and it did not pan out.
Gardner: You know, one of our better Rule Breakers stock picks is a company called Repligen. Repligen, ticker symbol RPGN, is often the company that companies like AnaptysBio use their tools in order to prepare for these FDA trials. My one hot tip, I can give you here, Rick, is that so many of those crazy drug names end with the three letters MAB, which stands for monoclonal antibody, and so that's exactly what it [...] or whatever you just tried to say to us, what it was. It's nice to know that Repligen was probably profiting even as AnaptysBio didn't succeed. You're right, a single day has sunk this stock for the last three years. You mentioned it was down 72% that day. Rick, overall down 79% now, three years later. What is thing No. 2 that hasn't gone so well for AnaptysBio?
Munarriz: Yeah. Again, this wasn't the only thing. I know you hear 72%, you're talking about 79% and you think, well, yeah, that's most -- but no, this actually only took the stuff from $35 to $10, because it has bounced back somewhat. This stock was sinking even before that dreadful day. A lot of it was because there was mounting evidence of Etokimab, and now, I'm just going to say [...] from now on with your hot tip today, but thank you. It wasn't going to be a game-changer, it had flopped earlier. It was being treated as a peanut allergy treatment and that didn't work. Also, a similar antibody candidate from Regeneron, a company that's had more success as a biotech on many other fronts, also didn't live up to the hype. It was working on its own IL-33 antibody for asthma patients. While that test produced positive signals two summers ago, it was not enough or Regeneron's existing drugs. People just said, hey, maybe this isn't like the holy grail of cures, and sure enough, we've had Etokimab basically strike out at three different times on three different treatments for them. This is a case of basically sell on the rumor, sell more on the news.
Gardner: I think it's also a case, Rick, too of these are really big diseases like eczema, asthma, these would've been huge markets, so I think that was part of the disappointment. If even one of those had worked, it would've been so great for AnaptysBio. We're not saying this story is over, by the way, we're going to get to a glimmer of hope, I hope in a minute. But it's worth pointing out that like Icarus, who flew too high, he flew too near the sun and his wings melted, from my memories of ancient Greek myths, this is kind of a company that soared high because of expectations that it could hit these big markets and when it didn't hit any of them, wow, has it ever gotten whack. We started a new tradition last year, I really liked it. I think we are going to do it again this year. My talented producer Rick Engdahl is on the hook for this. I think we should have a representative sound effect for each of these really bad picks, thematically on target where appropriate. For AnaptysBio, well, gee whiz, I can't really think of a bad biotech sound, but I will tell you this, this has been my worst stock pick. I think a cinematic explosion is entirely called for here. Rick, give us a glimmer of hope.
Munarriz: All right, here's the hope. Back in November, this November, not the previous November, which we know was so bad for investors, the company said that it had enough cash and cash equivalents and anticipated milestone revenue. It gets milestone payments from Glaxo [GlaxoSmithKline], $20 million from certain milestones with some of the things that are basically going through clinical trials, to fund its operating plan until at least 2023. This is important, because you're AnaptysBio, and this is a company that even though it's not a household name, its advanced seven internally generated therapeutics to the clinic over the last five years, time is the greatest gift of all.
Gardner: Well, thank you very much for that. Yes, it is worth pointing out that AnaptysBio hasn't done too badly in the last few months. It was as low as $14 in October, and the stock is now, as we mentioned, cruising around $24. So, depending on when you bought this stock, you might really like AnaptysBio. I will point out in closing on this one that this company, just like the other five, are all active recommendations today at Motley Fool Rule Breakers or Motley Fool Stock Advisor. We haven't swept any of them under the rug. We continue to hold out hope for each of them. But we also recognize that sometimes you make bad picks in life. I will probably stock a little bit about that at the end of this week's show. But Rick, thank you. That's AnaptysBio, ticker symbol ANAB, down 79.1%, my worst stock pick in the last three years.
Well, let's move on to my second worst stock pick in the last three years. Both of these were featured on last year's show. If you want to go back and listen to David's Biggest Losers Volume Five, January of 2020, you'll hear us in process with both AnaptysBio, which by the way, was in the No. 1 pool position last year's show as well, and here we are with iQiyi, ticker symbol IQ. This is often referred to as the Netflix of China. Well, not at all in terms of its stock performance, I'm sorry to say. I first picked iQIYI at $18.01. It was late April of 2018, almost three years ago, and to think that the stock right now is at $18.60, you might think, well, that's not that bad of stock pick because I picked it at $18 and now it's at $18.60 a few years later. But the problem is this, as the stock soared in spring and summer of 2018, I rerecommended iQIYI, ticker symbol again, IQ. It was June 14th of 2018, it had gone from $18 to $40.5 in less than two months. Having taken a shine to it, I rerecommended it right there at $40.51, which means now that it's back down to $18.60, 2.5 years later, this is my second where stock pick's down 54.1%. So, a really interesting thing, Rick, often I do like to add to my winners and I felt like we had a tiger by the tail back then, it turns out, well, it was a tiger. It was an anemic one and not one of those strong Asian tigers that I thought I'd gotten us all invested in. Rick, what has been going wrong, No. 1, for iQiyi?
Munarriz: Yeah. It was more of a paper tiger, I think. I think instead of the Netflix of China, maybe it was the Blockbuster of China, but I don't want to write it off just yet. Because again, I mean, and I fell for that, the whole Netflix of China thing, and I feel bad because I nudged you toward iQiyi at the time. At the time, yeah, it was the Netflix of China because it was the leading player in streaming in China. Obviously, I think we do this a lot with investing to basically make different industries and different companies in different countries seem more familiar to basically investors, U.S. investors. We play this Mad Libs game where we take a hot stock in the first blank space and an industry and region in the second, and it doesn't always pan out. Sometimes, you're actually right on this, and like MercadoLibre was a company that we called the eBay of South America when it went public and when it entered our universe. Now, eBay would love to be the MercadoLibre of North America right now.
Sometimes it does pan out, but obviously, with this, it didn't. But for iQiyi, it was really hot when it went public. In 2016, revenue more than doubled, revenue's up 55% in 2017, the year before it went public, and revenue was up 44% in 2018. It was doing all right even when it went public. But deceleration was the trend and that's normal. But then we saw revenue declined 16% last year and by last year, I'm sorry, I mean 2019. If we're looking at 2020, this will be single-digit growth for the company. So, this is really not a company that failed. It definitely failed to live up to this Netflix of China or any hot company of China hype.
Gardner: A huge slowdown and it's so often true of our Rule Breaker companies that they are big growers, they're growing fast and the market recognizes that and they trade up at premium multiples because of that growth. If the growth hits the skids for whatever reason, these often end up on David's Biggest Losers Volume X, and that's why iQiyi is a repeat performer. Rick, what's something else that hasn't gone so well for iQiyi?
Munarriz: Yes. Another issue with iQiyi is basically monetization. It works differently, it's not like Netflix. Netflix, everybody pays. Some people start on a free trial, but everybody is a paying subscriber. Most of China and most of basically the iQiyi's users, they're streaming on a free ad-supported version of it, and through most of 2019 and 2020, ad revenue was actually declining for many factors, but it clearly wasn't helping. The saving grace initially, was that premium subscriptions were on the rise, which is why revenue rose in 2019 and held up sort of OK through 2020 until recently, but in its latest quarter, basically at the end of September, we were up at 104.8 million paying subscribers on the platform. That was less than the 105.8 million that were there a year earlier. Netflix has had its hiccups, but if it ever has a year-over-year where actually subscribers have declined, people would sort of panic. I think you saw that here with iQiyi.
Gardner: We were talking about before the podcast started, what is an appropriate sound effect for a movie company that is not getting it done? I think that sound when a film reel runs out and it's just the flipping, back when there was film on actual reels, it wasn't all-digital. Maybe that could be the sound effect for this bad stock pick. All right, Rick, well, there can be a silver lining in every dark cloud, what do you see potentially ahead for 2021 and beyond for this active Rule Breaker recommendation, ticker symbol IQ?
Munarriz: Yes. It's a couple of small things here, but the first is that its ad revenue actually started to turn positive in its latest quarter. While its subscription revenue is now struggling, its ad revenue is starting to pick up again, at least sequentially, and that's nice to see. Also, this is a company that is neck-to-neck, basically with Tencent Video as the leaders in this very important market. Late last year, Reuters was reporting that Tencent and Alibaba, Alibaba is basically just in bronze medals in this market, they were talking to iQiyi majority stakeholder, which happens to be Baidu, a company that's done very well for us over the years about acquiring a controlling stake. It didn't pan out and of course, we don't even know if the chatter was true, even the writer is pretty credible, and we were talking about this for months last year and in 2019. But the chatter, it does validate the fact that iQiyi is an important player, whether Tencent or Alibaba step-up in 2020, not that we have the stock as a bio candidate at all. Just the fact that they're interested basically justifies the fact that iQiyi is still an important company and a player with a very large audience.
Gardner: All right and yeah, it is worth reminding ourselves, this is still a pretty substantial company. A lot of times, stocks that have been cut in half or worse for me end up down in the micro-cap ville. But Rick, this company's market cap is just over $14 billion as we speak today. By the way, I didn't mention AnaptysBio is in a micro-cap mill, our first stock by biggest loser is only a $650 million market cap these days, but gee whiz, iQiyi over $14 billion. This is not a company that's going to go out of business anytime soon.
Munarriz: Yes. Definitely.
Gardner: All right. My third worst stock pick of the last three years. We're going to go over to the Motley Fool Stock Advisor service for this one, this is my worst Stock Advisor pick of the last three years, Hawaiian Holdings (NASDAQL HA), the ticker symbol on the Nasdaq is HA. This is Hawaiian Air. This is a product I've enjoyed. I wish I could have enjoyed it more in my past, but back when the world traveled, do you remember those days, everybody? Yeah. I went to Hawaii a couple of times and I remember going on a Hawaiian Airlines airplane and enjoying the experience and thinking, ""Wow, these guys are really well-positioned,"" because it's not quite a monopoly, but they dominate back-and-forth U.S. mainland to Hawaii and back, and a few other places too. Unfortunately, things haven't gone so well for the travel industry and when you have a lot of airplanes that aren't flying that you need to keep maintaining, well, that can be very costly. Hawaiian Air, I first picked on January 17th of 2019, so that would be two years ago this month. There's something about January where I don't pick good stocks. Anyway, the stock back then was at $32.78, just check the price here, the market close on Tuesday, January 5th, and it's gone from $32.78 down to $18, even that is a loss of 45.1%. Rick Munarriz, have you ever flown Hawaiian Air?
Munarriz: I have. I've been to Honolulu a few times. Flying out of Los Angeles, and I don't know if they fly from Florida all the way over there, but I have connected from basically California to Hawaii once or twice.
Gardner: I hope you enjoyed that, but Rick, things haven't been going so great for Hawaiian Air in the last couple of years. I think many of us can probably imagine why, but what's thing No. 1 that presents itself to your mind?
Munarriz: Yes. The pandemic, of course. Hawaiian Airlines, they rely on leisure and luxury leisure tourism. Folks, obviously, aren't going to Hawaii, they didn't go to Hawaii last year and the others, they also clamped down. The state had a mandatory 14-day quarantine with a proof of a negative COVID-19 test for anyone traveling into Hawaii. Even if you wanted to go to Hawaii, there were a lot of hoops to jump through, and whether it was enforced or not, you still had to make it a long trip and in theory, staying quarantined. A lot of people just said, ""I'm just not going to go to Hawaii this summer,"" and that basically happened. Hawaiian Airlines is actually fearing worse than most of its other domestic rival airlines. Delta, American, and Southwest, they've all seen their revenue over the trailing four quarters decline in the low-to-mid 40% range. Obviously, it's been far worse the last two quarters, I'm just using the last 12 months, which includes the fourth quarter of 2019 and the first quarter of 2020 before everything started to go really soggy. But Hawaiian is at a 50% decline in revenue over the trailing 12 months versus the same months before, so clearly, it is a bad time to be an airline and it was even the worst time to be Hawaiian Holdings, the parent company of Hawaiian Airlines.
Gardner: It's just such an unfortunate timing and horrible timing on my part. It's even a little scary for me to say what the market cap of this company is because I think when we fly a company, we use the company's services, and they're an airline company, we want them to have a big market cap. I think big market caps make us feel safer as passengers. I do regret to mention that Hawaiian Holdings' present market cap is below $1 billion. If and when any of us flies Hawaiian Air again, we'll hope the stock is back up over $1 billion, because I don't think I want to be flying too many micro-cap airlines. Rick Munarriz, what's thing that's gone wrong No. 2?
Munarriz: The other reason to fasten your seat belts and for a bumpy ride is that business wasn't so hot even before the pandemic. Obviously, we know 2020 was bad, but 2019 wasn't so hot either for Hawaiian Holdings. Revenue dipped slightly, just down 0.2%, but still negative for all of 2019, it only had 11.7 million revenue passengers that year, down from 11.8 million a year earlier. Hawaiian Holdings, they said, ""Oh, it's just a competitive environment,"" as other players are trying to just take some of that business. But generally, it's just some rough time for Hawaiian tourism and for Hawaiian Airlines even before the pandemic. So yeah, this was obviously bad last year, but not so hot in 2019 either.
Gardner: Well, speaking of glimmers of hope, Rick Munarriz, I hear there's this thing called a vaccine. Vaccine may be at play here in 2021, your thoughts?
Munarriz: Yes, there's definitely good hope that we will get out of this at some point this year. It's not all [...], pardon the play on words, when it comes to Hawaiian Holdings. So, on airlines, while they have been hit hard, fuel prices are low, and so were the expectations and last month basically in December, Hawaiian Airlines introduced four new domestic routes, including three new cities that will be flying in the spring. It's also important to remember here with Hawaiian Airlines, and I mentioned this earlier, but it's important to connect this, this is mostly a travel airline. There isn't a lot of corporate travel to Hawaii. I know they have some conventions there and stuff like that, but there's not really a lot of business travel. Even though that may not make much sense right now, I think that while there is pent-up demand for folks to travel again for leisure, I don't think the same will hold true for corporate travel, or a lot more of that in the future is going to be done through video conferencing or virtual means. I think Hawaiian Airlines should go from one of the worst performers among airlines over the past year, on a trailing basis, to one of the better performers. Its business will pick up faster, then we will have others that are relying on business meetings, and travel, and corporate events to be happening. I think Hawaiian Airlines has a brighter future from this point on, than many of the other air carriers out there.
Gardner: Well, we will be watching, won't we? How many times in the last few months have I heard people point this out, maybe you've heard this too, Rick, that after the epidemic, the flu pandemic of 1918, the roaring 20s showed up. I can only imagine that if 2021 or 2022 becomes a great big party, and darn it, I sure hope that they do. I could imagine a lot of people might like to party in Hawaii. Let's keep our fingers crossed for Hawaiian Air that it can make it through an absolutely brutal environment for a small plane carrier.
Munarriz: I will bring my zoot suit and we will take a plane to a speakeasy in Honolulu, David.
Gardner: Thank you, Rick. Thank you for bravely shouldering the burden of talking about my three very worst stock picks. Again,AnaptysBio down 79%, iQiyi down 54%, and Hawaiian Holdings down 45%. Rick, talk to you again soon.
Munarriz: Thank you, David.
Gardner: Well, I think it's fair to call this halftime. Three down, three to go, and sometimes on the show, we use halftime to bring out the marching band and have some follies. That's exactly what I've designed for this week's show. Because one thing that jumps out to me is that these bad performers actually haven't been that bad. In years past, David's Biggest Losers has been full of stocks that have lost 80% or more of their value. This year, the next three that are coming are all down about a third or so since I first picked them in the last three years. Why would that be? Well, I think we all know why that would be. The stock market has been amazingly strong. In fact, I'm looking at Motley Fool Stock Advisor, I've made 36 picks, one per month over the last three years. It's from that group of 36 that we've selected, for example, Hawaiian Holdings, which has been such a bad stock pick, but nine of the 36 picks that I've made in Stock Advisor have doubled or better in the last three years, that's inside of three years, and 28 of the 36 are making money. It's slim pickings when you're looking back over the last three years thinking about how strong the market has been, and wow, over in Rule Breakers, I've picked two stocks every month over these last three years. That would be, 24 times 3 is 72 picks. Out of those 72 picks, get a load of this, 61 of them are up, 11 are down, so that's a pretty high hit rate, but here's a really high hit rate; of the 72, 33 of the picks have doubled or better, that's all inside of three years. I even took the time to [...] this up because it was quite amazing. We've had 16 two-baggers, eight three-baggers, five four-baggers, one five-bagger, two six-baggers, and one 10-bagger.
For people who are new to this talk, when I say bagger, it means a two-bagger has doubled its money. It's made a trip around the basis, which is where Peter Lynch's long time metaphor has come from the sport of baseball. When I say we've had 16 two-baggers, 16 of our 72 picks in the last three years have doubled, and wow, 8 three baggers, etc. MongoDB on its own up 10 times, pretty much wipes all of the bad stock picks that you're hearing about on this week's show for anybody who's owned MongoDB. I'll now ask the marching band to put down its instruments and begin to settle down for the second half. But it's worth pointing out just how incredibly strong the market has been, and in particular, how incredibly strong the Rule Breaker investing strategy and these kinds of companies that we've talked about on this podcast, not just for the last three years, but for the last six years now that we're into 2021, just how strong that strategy has been rewarded in recent years. It's very unlikely we'll see anything like those numbers over the next three years, because it's been so tremendously spectacular.
Now, I'm not sounding a bearish note. I think the market is going up this year and it does go up more years than it goes down. But it's worth reminding ourselves, especially for newer investors, pinch yourself. It's very hard to ever put up numbers like this on any consistent basis. I myself am amazed by the performance of Motley Fool Rule Breakers and Stock Advisor here over the last three years. All right. Well, for the second half, I would like to welcome back another one of my guest stars. It is my longtime friend and analyst, Karl Thiel. Karl, welcome back to Rule Breaker Investing.
Karl Thiel: [laughs] Hi, I'm glad to be here.
Gardner: Thank you very much for graciously consenting to look over some of my very worst picks over the last three years. Karl, could you give a sentence or two about who you are, and maybe one past work experience for you? What did you do before you came to The Motley Fool?
Thiel: Among many things I have done, from shoe salesman to record store flunky in my extreme youth, I worked on a biotech mutual fund at one point, shortly before I came to The Motley Fool. That explains a little bit about what I do. I'm an analyst on Rule Breakers and on Stock Advisor. Been with the company about 16 years and have a special love of healthcare, but not exclusively that.
Gardner: Well, and we're not going to be talking too much about healthcare as I look over these three particular companies, Karl, but like so many Motley Fools, you are a five-tool athlete, you can do it all, so let's look across a Motley array here of companies. Worst stock pick in the last three years, No. 4, Nutanix (NASDAQ: NTNX), ticker symbol NTNX. Took a shine to it March of 2018, the stock was at $47.94 back then. It closed Tuesday of this week at $31.09, that means it's down 35.1% over the last three years. Karl, what is something that has gone wrong for Nutanix?
Thiel: Okay, I'll just give you a few quick numbers. In the company's fiscal 2017, revenue grew 68%. In 2018, it grew 37%. In 2019, it grew 7%, and in 2020 it grew 5.8%, and it's actually a tick lower than that now for the trailing 12 months.
Gardner: How?
Thiel: They have just had straight up poor execution of sales. Now, the numbers I'm giving you are a little bit tweaked by the fact that they've also been shifting to a subscription model, and so that means less upfront money, more deferred revenue that does tweak those numbers, but that does not explain all of it. They have acknowledged that they have just been doing a poor job with lead generation and following through on sales.
Gardner: A lot of people will not know anything about Nutanix, and I wish I didn't know anything about Nutanix [laughs] at this point, but would you just briefly lay out, what is this enterprise software company that's transitioning from enterprise sales, the older format to the more clouded sales these days, which has been very promising for so many companies that have done this over the years, but what is Nutanix doing?
Thiel: I don't want to pretend I know this company better than I do. You'd have to ask our fellow analyst, Tim Beyers, for a truly expert take, but they do hybrid Cloud solutions. The idea is if you want to have part of your business in the Cloud on something like Amazon Web Services, but you also want to own your own equipment, and be integrating those two things together, this gives you the operating system for your equipment and the software to tie it all together, something that they have called a $100 billion market.
Gardner: Well explained. An hyper-converged infrastructure is some of the jargon used around this company. It reminds me how truly complicated Cloud software and the whole business can be, and this is one of the harder ones to understand, which by the way, goes against Peter Lynch's old dictum that you should be able to pitch anybody the stock in a quick elevator ride at 60 second as to why you're investing in that company. Sometimes in the past I've said great stocks don't make me think. Unfortunately, this one does make us have to think quite a bit to understand what Nutanix does. Karl, what's something else besides the huge sales slowdown that hasn't gone so well for Nutanix?
Thiel: In addition to that, and just the growing pains with switching over to the subscription model, I don't think it helped that the company's founder and CEO, Dheeraj Pandey, stepped down surprisingly in August, there was really not very much warning of that. I think that just added to the sense of disarray at the company.
Gardner: Indeed, since this is now our 6th episode, our 6th year in a row of doing this, two of the big themes that always come back each year, are sales slowdowns and change in management, especially when the CEO has left recently, or if the co-founder takes off, or both of them do, if they're not the same person. These are often some of our worst companies. When I think about the Cloud and Enterprise and I think, what is the sound that could emerge, a scary sound from clouds. I'm not sure it actually emerges from clouds, but thunder seems to attend to clouds, and it is an awfully scary sound. I sure wish I heard this sound just before I picked the stock because maybe I wouldn't have.
Karl, is there a reason for hope? I'm hearing you talk about how the company's transitioning over to the Cloud. That often can make financials look bad in the near-term, but improve after that.
Thiel: Yeah. I think that's the case here. You mentioned hyper-converged infrastructure, which is very jargony, but I will say that the research firm Gartner has a magic quadrant for hyper-converged infrastructure software. Just a few weeks ago, Nutanix was named a leader and the runaway leader for the fourth year in a row. They haven't lost their edge in this market. I do think the market is a good one. They're just having a really poor job with execution and just some growing pains. I think once they start to move back through those growing pains and can right-size some of the stuff, they still have a pretty decent opportunity.
Gardner: Well, some of David's Biggest Losers every year do bounce back. In fact, I'll be closing the show with how last year's list has done since last year's show to this year. It's fun to look back on these. I will point out, Nutanix has been a pretty strong stock. The stock was down around $15 in April of last year. Now, eight months later, it's doubled, which isn't a bad eight-month return. Often, some of my worst picks are just because I timed them wrong. I should've bought that other quarter, not that first-quarter. Whatever I did, I did it wrong. Let's leave Nutanix right there, stock No. 4.
Now onto worst performer No. 5. The ticker symbol is BZUN, this is Baozun. It was at $54.5 in June of 2018. 2.5 years later, it's gone from $54.5 to about $35.5. This stock is down 34.7%. Earlier, Rick and I were making light of saying things like the Netflix of China. I always love ""the Elvis of Mexico."" We have this tendency as Americans especially, I think, to try to relate other cultures to pop-cultural phenomena of our own. Baozun, we've sometimes said in the past, Karl, the Shopify of China, but in the same way that iQiyi hasn't exactly performed like Netflix, Baozun has not exactly performed like Shopify. Karl, what's been happening with Baozun?
Thiel: You were just talking about, with Nutanix, how maybe if you had bought it at a slightly different time, recommended it at a slightly different time, things would be different. That is truly the case with this one. Not to pour any salt on wounds or anything, but if you pull up a five-year chart of Baozun, there's this big peak right around June of 2018 [laughs] and then it comes straight down.
Gardner: I hit it perfectly.
Thiel: This one is really more of a flat performer for the last couple of years than it is certainly not a falling knife. It's just been moving sideways. I think there are a few reasons for that. Certainly, one is the volatility of the Chinese economy, or really the slowing of the Chinese economy. I personally find this hard to wrap my head around, but the economic growth of China of 6.1% in 2019 was a 30-year low.
Gardner: Incredible.
Thiel: Amazing. It has slowed since then. Bottom line, this company basically helps foreign brands to have a presence in the Chinese market and those are typically higher-end luxury goods. If the economy is slow, then there is always the risk that the sales do not do well.
Gardner: I neglected to mention earlier, Nutanix's market cap, which is right around $6 billion. Baozun, also having lost a third of its value in the last few years, is right around $2.8 billion on the key data I'm looking at on the Nasdaq site right now, it can sometimes be a little confusing with ADRs. I think I have that one right, Karl. But $2.8 billion, that's nothing to sneeze at. Like iQiyi, which we mentioned earlier, it's not like this company is going to disappear anytime soon. Karl, what's something else that has not gone so well for Baozun and/or its shareholders?
Thiel: Well, I think contributing to investor discomfort has certainly been the trade war, it has been a factor. Then I think more recently, the company just did a really big share offering with 40 million new shares worth of dilution. That was back in September. I think that, again, just is a little bit more discomfort for investors.
Gardner: All right. Well, anytime a company adds more shares into the market, more people are buying it, but that does dilute all existing shareholders, which doesn't usually make existing shareholders that happy. But sometimes it can be a neutral, as opposed to merely a drawback because after all, the company did raise money and it can then deploy that toward its growth. Nothing specifically comes to mind in terms of what is an appropriate sound effect for me for Baozun. I'm just going to ask Rick Engdahl, who is a musician himself, and has deep musical knowledge to place a brief snatch of a really sad song.
Gardner: Lacrimosa indeed. This is a company that's been a little bit spotty on its growth, but it is a company by the way that is profitable. We're not talking about a fly by night company hoping one day to make a profit. Baozun is profitable. Maybe there's some hope there. Karl, do you see any other hope for ticker symbol BZUN?
Thiel: Well, this one was easy. I feel like this company has been a little bit unfairly beaten up. They never really stopped executing growth, given all the difficulties we just mentioned with China's economy. It still grew solidly over 2020. At some point, if you keep growing while your stock-price remains the same, something's got to give. At this point, they are trading at less than 20 times projected earnings for 2021. I think until there's nothing actually broken with the story here and it looks pretty good going forward.
Gardner: Well, that's good to hear. This is one of those stocks, and I never look at charts in this way, I'm having fun with this, but anytime and whenever $42, you should've been selling in the last year, and anytime it went down below $32, you should've been buying because it's been a sign wave stock here. It looks like a cyclical, but this is not a cyclical company, at least that's not our expectation or hope. Well, again, all of these six stocks I've already mentioned more than once remains an active recommendation, in this case for Motley Fool Rule Breakers. We fellow Rule Breakers, generally happy few, will hope for better things for Baozun in the couple of years ahead. This is also a 2018 bad pick though. This will be the last time it shows in the David's Biggest Losers podcast, because we only look back three years and by January of 2022, we will no longer see 2018, which seems like the year where I picked all of my losers, but also some of my very best picks I've made in the last few years. Funny to note that.
Well, Karl, let's go onto the final one then. Really all three of these stocks that you and I are talking about are all down right about the same amount. BlackBerry (NYSE: BB), ticker symbol BB is my sixth-worst pick over the last three years. It was at $10.33 in mid-July of 2018. Less than 2.5 years later, it's gone from $10 and a third, down to $6.66. BlackBerry is down 34.5%, just enough, just down enough to make this podcast. Now, Karl, this is a company a lot of us know. We remember how BlackBerry dominated corporate email, in particular mobile email on the go in the 1990s. The company these days has really tried to transition after getting absolutely whacked by the Apple iPhone. It's been transitioning into cybersecurity. What has not been going well for BlackBerry?
Thiel: BlackBerry makes its money in a few different ways. It was always known for its handsets for having high levels of security. They were favored sometimes as corporate devices, for simply that reason, and that's really what BlackBerry doubled down on when it changed its name away for Research in Motion. It makes money from its security business, from its IoT business, and from its licensing. On the security side, it made a big acquisition. It's the biggest, I think ever, all-cash $1.4 billion acquisition of Cylance in 2018, and it just hasn't worked out all that well. Even though BlackBerry has eked out some growth, the software and services side of it has dragged it back a little bit. Because they're specializing in endpoint security, so how do you protect this laptop, this device, and everything in a corporate network? In a work from home time, you would think that that was doing really well, but it's been no CrowdStrike, let's put it that way.
Gardner: Well, I can only imagine any way the difficulty of trying to transition from the BlackBerry that was to the BlackBerry that will be and still remain a going concern. In a lot of ways, it's impressive what this leading Canadian company has managed to do. Its market cap, by the way, $3.7 billion today, a fraction of where it was back in the golden times. But Karl, we've been promising two things going wrong for each of these companies. What's the second thing beyond that Cylance acquisition that hasn't been going so well for BlackBerry?
Thiel: Well, I mentioned two legs to this tool. Another leg is its licensing business. Even though they're not really in the handset business anymore, they own some 38,000 patents and they license them out. There are BlackBerry devices that are made using those patents. But this is a go-nowhere business. At the same time, it's still significant. They're looking at this to shrink in the current year. It's just hard to see this becoming a major growth driver. It just becomes an important leg but a shrinking one, which is a little bit of a weight on the company.
Gardner: For this bad sound effect, I'm thinking BlackBerry, makes me think of berries, a juicer. There's got to be a juicer sound because the stock has been juiced.
All right. Well now, let's turn toward the positive, and you don't have to look very far back to find a real positive. This stock was just hanging around $5 a share in November. All of a sudden, I think it was an earnings report right at the end of November. It all of a sudden, gapped from $6 up to nearly $9. It was up almost 50% in the first few weeks of December, again, just a month ago, settling just below $7, but that was an outstanding recent performance. Often, Karl, I think the market likes to look ahead. With the stock surging, do you see some reason for optimism here for BlackBerry in 2021?
Thiel: Well, this is the reason why stools have three legs. There is a third one, [laughs] and that is the IoT business. That looks pretty promising going forward. I think one of the big catalysts has been a recent deal with Amazon Web Services that BlackBerry announced.
Gardner: That's right.
Thiel: They have their QNX operating system, which is particularly used in vehicles. The idea is to create a standard secure operating system that auto manufacturers can use to develop vehicle apps or connected services. They have about 50% market share, but the rest of the market, from what I see, is very fractured. Partnering with Amazon Web Services and saying, ""Look, this is going to be fast, easy, and secure for you to develop some new connected service for an automobile."" That makes it pretty appealing to adopt QNX and make that more of a standard. I think that is a definite piece of good news for them going forward.
Gardner: All right. You're absolutely right. I think I misspoke it. It really was that Amazon Web Services announcement. I see now it was on December 1st. Just one month ago, that really did catapult BlackBerry stock. Let's hope for some continued better things in the months ahead. Well, Karl, I want to thank you very much for reviewing three more of my very worst stock picks for the last three years. Do you have any overall reflection before I let you go?
Thiel: Honestly, when you gave me these picks, I was like, ""Really, just like 30%-some? That doesn't seem bad for [laughs] considering how much we swing for the fences from time-to-time."" I thought this is a pretty tame list.
Gardner: Well, it is true. I guess if we do the math, we picked 108 stocks over these three years in Rule Breakers and Stock Advisors. Out of 108 for our sixth worst to be down 34%, I think I'd probably take that most three-year periods. It has been a remarkable time. Well, Karl, thank you so much once again for your contribution in Rule Breaker Investing.
Thiel: Thank you.
Gardner: Well, after so much sturm und drang and some sad moments, some sad songs and sounds and regrets for bad decisions acted upon, I did promise earlier in the show that there might be some more light at the end of the tunnel. It comes in this form. Each year, for David's Biggest Losers, I've enjoyed looking back at how the ones from the previous year did in the ensuing 12 months. Now, we're going to go back to last year's show where I covered six stocks. Once again, the six worst performers of the previous three years up to January of 2020, and let's see how each of them has done.
Trivago, on last year's show, was the second worst performer. It was at $2.75. I'm sad to say that it's gone from $2.75 down to $2.25 since in the last year. It's lost again about 20% of its value. I'm even sadder to say that we parted ways with it earlier this year at $1.60. In other words, it's actually come back some from when I decided this console, at least, finally to sell the stock in Motley Fool Rule Breakers. Trivago has been an underperformer. Another underperformer, and I referenced that earlier, was iQiYi which we've already covered in this show, was at $23.5 a year ago when it was also on David's Biggest Losers. But this year, it's gone from $23.5 to $18.5, so not such a good year for iQiYi.
AnaptysBio, ticker symbol ANAB. Yes, it's still well down from when we first picked it years ago. But I'm happy to say, in the past year, since I featured it on last year's show, it's gone from $15 last year up to $24 this year. That's a 60% gain, but it gets better from there, because Camping World Holdings. Marcus Lemonis, the CEO of Camping World Holdings is also the star of the CNBC show, The Profit. Marcus Lemonis went to Rick's High School. I remember him mentioning it last year. Well, it's been quite a year for the RV industry, as we would all understand, and Camping World Holdings was at $13 when it was featured on last year's show, one year later, it's at $28, more than a double.
Then, the star of that show now looking back, Upwork (NASDAQ: UPWK), ticker symbol UPWK. This is a company that supports the gig economy. It competes with Fiverr, for those who know Fiverr. Upwork, a year ago, was featured in two of the six slots. That's right. I recommended Upwork. It went down. I recommended it again. It went down even further. Upwork was No. 4 and No. 5 on last year's show when it was around $10 a share, while Upwork today is at $34.5. I think a basket of buying the dogs of last year's David's Biggest Losers has been a market beater, thanks in no small part to Upwork, but certainly, Camping World Holdings and AnaptysBio making contributions as well.
A few quick thoughts just to close, three of them for you. The first is losing is normal. We're learning how to skate as we invest. If you've ever learned how to skate, either on roller skates or high skates, you know that you fell, you fell a lot, and that's when you're learning skating, but I think investing is permanently like learning skating. That is 35 years after I've started, I still fall all over the ice. Look what we've just featured this week. All of these bad stock picks I've made, you'd think I'd have gotten better, but no, I think losing is always going to be part of investing. This is normal, my friends. Second thought. We like to talk about our losers. I actually had some fun with this show, I hope you did too. Being transparent is so important to us at The Motley Fool.
We try to be a financial source for you that's going to give you accountability. We own all that we do. I realize the Internet, especially, as a powerful medium net regard, because I've been able to just look at the scorecards that we published for all our members and pull these stocks write-off of them, and give you the prices where they were then and where they are now. I've always loved that the Internet is a medium with a memory. TV by contrast, a lot of people get financial advice from TV. TV, in my experience, has no real memory. There are people who make constantly unaccountable claims all the time making stock market calls on individual stocks or the market at large, and no one really ever remembers what they said, because they're not looking to be transparent and accountable. Well, that's what I love doing on this show.
Third, and finally, don't live in fear of losing because you'll never really win. You'll never have the moon, a beautiful song's lyrics once went. Losing to win is one of my big themes, and it even won a Bestie last year because it was one of my favorite podcasts that I got to do for you last year. If you want to hear me talking even more about my miserable losers, go back just a few months ago, and listen to my Losing to Win podcasts. We're talking shot in Freud City here. But a reminder, part of losing to win is that your winners will so far outweigh your losers if you just give them time to do so. In that dynamic world of stock market trading that is so often depicted in ads or people throwing up pieces of paper, it used to be on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. A lot of you and me, a lot of individual mom-and-pop investors came away with the idea that we had to be very active to do it well. Well, I've never felt that doing it well involves being very active. In fact, allowing your losers to lose and your winners to win, in my experience, almost always pays you far beyond what you would have thought. Patience is at the heart of this and not living in fear of losing because you'll never really win if you don't allow yourself to lose.
Maybe I'll mention one final stock here at the end then, because it was Volume 2 of David's Biggest Losers, January 2017, when at the time I was including this company, Restoration Hardware. The company is now called RH. They have shortened their name just to RH. The ticker symbol remains RH, but it was presented again four years ago. This week, when I did David's Biggest Losers, this is the ultimate comeback stock. It was at $25 back then. I featured it last year's show with some more Rocky music, because it had gone from $25 to $225. That's right, up nine times in value, since we featured it on this show four years ago as one of my biggest losers. Darn it, over the last year, if Restoration Hardware, RH, hasn't doubled yet again, from $225 a share to $450 a share, so that 18 times return on its own, again, will wipe out all of David's Biggest Losers that have ever been featured on this podcast series. I hope you're taking that lesson to heart.
Well, thanks again for joining with me here at the start of 2021. On next week's show, I'm going to be talking about how to build and maintain a portfolio. This is one of those conversations that keeps happening with mailbag entries that I speak to over the years. But I really want to definitively speak next week to how to start a portfolio, and then how to maintain a portfolio, the Rule Breaker way. We have that to look forward to. In the meantime, have a great week. Fool on!

2021-01-12 00:00:00+00:00,Does eBay's Stock Have More Than 20% Upside?,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/does-ebays-stock-have-more-than-20-upside-2021-01-12,,,"Having gained more than 43% in 2020, eBay’s stock (NASDAQ: EBAY) still has further growth potential of about 20% in the near term. EBAY’s stock has rallied from $36 to $52 in 2020 compared to the S&P 500 which moved 14% in the same period. The company has seen good revenue growth over recent years, while its P/S multiple has remained flat. We believe the stock, after the recent rally, still has potential for further growth. Our dashboard ‘Buy or Sell eBay’s Stock‘ has the underlying numbers.
Due to the Covid-19 crisis, consumers have shifted toward online marketplaces, which benefited eBay as it saw its revenues rise by 10% in the first nine months of the year, compared to the same period in the previous year. In Q3 2020, eBay beat consensus estimates for revenue recorded at $2.6 billion, up 25% y-o-y and earnings recorded at $0.95 compared to $0.37 in the same period of the previous year. Further, the company reported $1.66 billion in cash inflows from operating activities for the first nine months. Trefis estimates Net Income to increase to $1.9 billion for 2020, increasing the EPS to $2.68. Thereafter, revenues are expected to grow to $11.9 billion in 2021. In addition, the EPS figure is likely to improve to $2.96, which coupled with the P/E multiple of around 21x will lead to eBay’s valuation of $63, up more than 20% from the current market price.
  [Updated 10/08/2020]  Shift To Online Marketplaces To Help eBay’s Stock?
Despite doubling from its March lows of this year, at the current price near $52, we believe eBay’s stock (NASDAQ: EBAY) is undervalued. eBay’s stock has rallied from $26 to $52 off the recent bottom compared to the S&P 500 which has risen by 50% from its recent bottom. The stock was able to beat the broader market in the last 6 months as the US government announced a string of measures along with stimulus packages announced in other economies to keep businesses afloat. eBay benefited additionally because (1) people were preferring online marketplaces which saw its merchandise volumes grow in double-digits even in April and May, and (2) eBay’s reached a deal to sell its classified business to Adevinta for $9.2 billion.
Looking at the bigger picture, some of the rise over the last two years is justified by the roughly 9% rise in eBay’s revenues, which, in turn, led to a 36% rise in revenue per share (RPS) during this period as the number of shares outstanding saw a decline of 20%. Further, its Net Income has improved from $-1 Bil in 2017 to $1.8 Bil in 2019.
The P/S multiple fell from 3.9x at the end of 2017 to 2.8x at the end of 2019. The multiple rose back to 4.1x currently as more consumers moved toward online marketplaces during the pandemic.
Effect of Coronavirus?
The global spread of coronavirus led to lockdown in various cities across the globe, which affected industrial and economic activity. Online marketplaces gained more traction due to lockdown and restrictions in various regions leading to eBay gaining 8 million buyers in Q2 2020. For Q2 2020 Revenue was $2.9 billion, up 18% y-o-y while Gross Merchandise Volume was recorded at $27.1 billion, up 26% y-o-y.
  The actual recovery and its timing hinge on the broader containment of the coronavirus spread. Our dashboard Trends In U.S. Covid-19 Cases provides an overview of how the pandemic has been spreading in the U.S. and contrasts with trends in Brazil and Russia. With investors focusing their attention on 2021 results, the valuations become important in finding value.
What if you’re looking for a more balanced portfolio instead? Here’s a high quality portfolio to beat the market, with over 100% return since 2016, versus 55% for the S&P 500. Comprised of companies with strong revenue growth, healthy profits, lots of cash, and low risk, it has outperformed the broader market year after year, consistently.

This video was recorded on December 18, 2020.
David Gardner: Here we are at the end of it all. All 2020. All of it. You and me here together at the end of it all. What did you make of it? How did you do? How would you score yourself? What's your single favorite memory or moment? Did you have your heart broken? I bet you did at least once. Never forget that, but do get past it. What three lessons will you take away and with whom will you share those three lessons? When English speakers worldwide sing tomorrow, ""Should old acquaintance be forgot,"" remember that lyric is just the start of a rhetorical question. I don't think 18th century Scottish poet Robert Burns was suggesting that you forget old acquaintances, but some non trivial amount of this year and feel free to round it up, we might want to forget. If that's you, you have my Foolish permission to do so.
None of us though will forget the stock market, how it dove and rose. How many of our favorite companies went on to higher heights than we would've dreamed at this time last year. Do you remember? Think about it. Could you have imagined, dear fellow Tesla shareholder, that as Tesla started the fateful year of 2020 below $100 a share, that it would finish over $600? That is an acquaintance not to be forgotten. So here, at the end of it all, I say, we close things out as we always do every month. This for the 62nd time in Rule Breaker Investing podcast history, the 62nd mailbag at the end of it all, only on this week's Rule Breaker Investing.
Welcome back to Rule Breaker Investing. My producer, Rick Engdahl, mentioned to me when I said 62nd, that's a six with the two after it. But it also sounds like we're about to do a mailbag in exactly one minute, 60-seconds. But that is definitely not the case. In fact, our mailbag runneth over this month and as usual, there is no way for me to take 38 pages of amazing questions, stories, and thoughts, and do any real justice to more than about a third of it. We'll have approximately 12 points to finish your year here in 2020. We will be doing this in more than 60 seconds on the 62nd historical Rule Breaker Investing mailbag. Well, at the end of it all, in this case, just the end of this month, I always like to look back to the month briefly that has been. We kicked it off with Games, Games, Games: Volume 2, that was my holiday game gift buying guide. This podcast, which was actually recorded on Friday, December 18th, Rick and I, I hope are enjoying the holidays with our families as you hear us. By the way, we've never taken a week off. Every single week since July of 2015, you've gotten a fresh new podcast. Darn it, we're certainly not going to stop that record now.
Even though we recorded this on December 18th, it's somewhere right near the end of the year, which means a holiday gift game buying guide might not be that useful. However, if you are still looking for a late gift, that Games, Games, Games episode, in which I reveal 15 games in three different lists, that should suit, I hope, any taste might still be helpful. The week after was gratitude 2020. It was time to say thank you to many for this year. The week after that, the third week of the month, it was our Besties of 2020, thinking back on what I found to be some of the most compelling podcasts we got to bring you in the year 2020 with cameos. Everybody, from my brother, Tom, to my friend Vennard Wright, to our Board Member, John Mackey, the founder of Whole Foods, all with a few minutes of thinking about this year and next. I hope you enjoyed our first annual Besties.
Last week, of course, the Market Cap Game Show, because that's what we do the second to last Wednesday of every quarter. That was our 14th episode. Congratulations, again, to Maria Gallagher, which brings us to this mailbag. I have already conveyed, we have a lot to get through. I say we get started. I always like to start with hot takes from Twitter. I've got four tweets to share this time. The first one comes from my friend Mahan Tavakoli, @Mahany, that's Mahan with a Y on the end of it, ""@DavidGFool, the conversations you have with your people team on the Rule Breaker Investing podcast are some of my favorites. I use those as examples of what great organizational culture and truly caring about people looks like."" Well, wow, thank you, Mahan. Coming from you, that means a lot. You're reflecting on the conversation I had with Lee Burbage and Kara Chambers as well. We had a few this year, but especially our work from home edition, where we shared some of The Motley Fool's best tips we could give you if you are also working from home or a leader trying to help others work from home. That was certainly one of our besties of 2020. Mahan, thank you for that.
By the way, I can mention that I was on Mahan's podcast. Occasionally, I'm on other people's podcast. So if you're interested in hearing a conversation about leadership and some more personal life stuff, I'm sure as well, please, join me and Mahan. His website is partneringleadership.com and that's the name of the podcast. If you want too much of me this month, I'm there for you.
The next one comes from @Inveduko. That's Inveduko LLC. Looks like some kind of a money management firm, ""@DavidGFool, do you think the S&P 500 is still the best benchmark for the types of companies you recommend, given that many of them are high growth tech stocks?"" Not a phrase I use but, ""Would the QQQ possibly be a better benchmark than Nasdaq Composite?"" Well, thanks, Inveduko. First of all, I encourage anybody to compare my performance or your performance or anyone else's against any benchmark that they like. For me, I've always used the S&P 500 because it's the gold standard. It's the one that all mutual funds or index funds get compared to. From day one of The Motley Fool, we've said we think you can beat the market. We think you could beat the S&P 500. That really is the most representative index that I can think of. While it's certainly true that a lot of our companies are Nasdaq companies and some of our New York Stock Exchange companies look more like tech-centric Nasdaq companies. At the same time, we have a wide variety of different companies. I actually think that if I started comparing my performance to the Nasdaq, some people would say, ""Why aren't you using the S&P 500? That's what everybody else uses."" But again, anybody is welcome to compare our performance to anything that they would like.
All right, tweet No. 3. This one is from @chrisc195, Chris says, ""Are you saying that out of 135 picks over 5+ years, that they averaged 97% gains each?"" Well, first of all, thank you, Chris, for that. What he is referring to is the performance of our five-stock samplers. So, any new listener should know that every 10 weeks or so on this podcast for five years now, I've picked a basket of five stocks, usually to a theme. Sometimes a serious minded theme and sometimes a completely silly theme, but each time, we're typically picking them for three years. Now, we like them past those three years, but we make it a three-year game and we track it here on this podcast. That's been an important part of Rule Breaker Investing, really from day one. So, if you do that for 5+ years every 10 weeks or so, you end up doing it 27 times, which is exactly how many five stock samplers we have presented. If you multiply 27 times 5, you end up with 135 stocks. So, Chris said, ""Are you saying that out of 135 picks over 5+ years, that they averaged 97% gains each?"" I'm really happy and I'm amazed to be able to say, yes, Chris. That is exactly what I was saying. I've got an update. Again, we're recording on Friday, December 18th, but as of now, they now average 108%, so we're beating that 97%, at least, with one week to go in the year.
I'm absolutely flabbergasted myself by the performance of the five stock samplers, certainly the ones from this year, to think that the Coronavirus stocks picked in April would average those five stocks a gain of 264% is well above and beyond any expectations I or you should ever have going forward. But even going back some years, it wasn't just about hot stocks in 2020, it was about the track that we've been laying for years and years. Now, as Rule Breaker investors following this strategy, both the types of companies we pick and how we treat them, yes, I do think you can do with the academics. Think you can't, I think you can beat the market and beat it really badly by following this approach over time. So Chris, yes, 135 picks, 5+ years, and if you take all 135 of those stocks and you simply average their gain, as of now, they're up 108% each as a group.
The last tweet, this one comes from Vince [...], ""None of the so-called experts on the talking head shows ever keep score and review their picks. You've set the bar not only for performance but for transparency, fair play, and genuine optimism."" Vince, thank you very much for that. This is going to sound too much like chess pounding, so I'm just going to stop it right now because that's not the purpose of Rule Breaker Investing. But I do believe that the more other people hold themselves accountable in front of their audiences with the stocks that they're picking or their predictions that they're making, the more successful they will be, the more successful you listening to them will be, the better our world will be. I sure hope that somebody will start copying me and doing his or her own five stock samplers on a regular basis and scoring it in front of their audience as well. It can get addictive, and it's pretty fun.
Well, a reminder, you can follow our podcast @RBIpodcast, on Twitter. I'm at @DavidGFool on Twitter. Just maybe before the year ends, you'd like to drop us a review. Maybe you followed us on Spotify or on iTunes. Yeah, you can drop reviews of any podcast right there, and we love to hear from you. We love to hear how we're doing. Throw me some stars, we read every one. That's a nice little way to show some gratitude right at the end of the year, if you want to. Thanks. All right.
Rule Breaker mailbag, item No. 1, ""David, I just wanted to say thank you for sharing a little of your private life on your latest podcast. Hearing your gratitude and love for your wife, Margaret, was deeply moving and brought a tear to my eye."" Wow. Thank you, Bryce G., what a beautiful sentiment, you go on to say, ""I don't know if she listens to the podcast regularly, but I hope she listens to that one."" Well, I'm happy to say she does occasionally listen to this podcast. She's certainly not expected to and she sure hasn't gone through all of them or anything, but I did make a point of taking her out for a car ride. Yeah, we occasionally go out in the car these days. Is there anybody else still occasionally going out with the car these days? We just went out on a car ride in the past week and I just played that last bit for her. Bryce goes on to say, ''I'm a private person myself, I don't really participate or write into things like this very often, so I hope you received this.'' Well, thank you, Bryce. Yeah, I get it all. In fact, Rick Engdahl puts time in to gather all of your notes, rbi@fool.com is the email address. We gather those every month along with the tweets, and so I read them all, ""That said, I'd like to also share my gratitude to you and Tom,"" Bryce continues, ""for creating The Motley Fool and for making me smarter, happier, and richer. I've been a member for over 12 years now of various services, Stock Advisor, Rule Breakers, Options, Duke Street, back in the day, Supernova and now, back to Stock Advisor and Rule Breakers, and I try to share your words of wisdom with those closest to me whenever I can. I know at least three of my friends have signed up for the services."" Wow, thanks, Bryce. ""Keep doing the great work you do and I look forward to the next 12 years and beyond, Fool on, Bryce.""
Well, just a lovely sentiment and thank you for calling out my gratitude episode. I appreciate you as a fellow private person taking time to reach out to us. My friend Bob [...], who is a longtime Motley Fool member, said he was surprised when I described myself as a private person, because you said you share quite a lot through your podcast, and you talked a lot about your life. He thought it was ironic, but the truth is, I rarely have talked about my family. Of course, I spend so much time with them, thinking about them all the time and as a more public person, I don't try to make them part of my public life, so that's why I put it that way. But Bryce, thank you so much for the note.
This reminds me, before I go onto some of the other mailbag items this month, these are long on gratitude. In fact, there are well more than a dozen that I'm not getting to share with you, but they all read fairly similarly. They are gratitude for extreme performance or outperformance in this year of 2020, which puts me in a tough position because, first of all, I want to say, thank you back. That's what I'm going to say right now, if you found that you didn't get to read this particular mailbag, and you put your heart and soul into it, and you said a huge thanks, you should know, I'm saying back to you along with my brother, Tom, and our whole company, you are welcome. Thank you for taking the time. At the same time, mailbag wouldn't be that interesting or it would be seemy if I just shared all of those back. There's certainly some of those running through these, in particular this month, with so much gratitude, I thought, what are some of the ones that teach a lesson or make a good point in addition? Especially, tie would go to those who've been with us for a long time.
If you just started investing in 2020, which took some courage if it was around March or April, I congratulate you. But if you find that I'm not reading your story, it's probably because I'm reading the story of somebody who's been with The Motley Fool for five years, not just one, or for 12 years, not just five. Because that's the real game that we're playing. We're playing the long game at The Motley Fool, and you as a fellow Fool, I hope you're doing the same. Still, you'll understand if I didn't get to that many people, who are just amazed by their nine-month returns at the same time, I sure hope you turn those nine months into nine years. With every passing year, there's more chance that I'll read your mailbag item.
Rule Breaker mailbag item No. 2, this one comes from long time Fool, Darren from Raleigh, North Carolina. By the way, Raleigh, North Carolina, I think I saw that it was named one of America's five happiest cities and the happiest one in the state of North Carolina. Hope things are going well, Darren, it sure seems like it based on this note. ""David, good morning. Quick update, on track for 95% return this year and 175% over the last three years, mainly from letting winners win and losers lose. I have not sold anything beyond Rule Breakers and Stock Advisor sell recommendations, which we don't make too many of, since we met up five-years ago."" Wow, that long. Darren's referring to a trip he made to Fool HQ. He is one of those members who thought, if I'm going to be taking financial advice from you guys, and that's going to matter a lot in my life, maybe I should take the time out to see who you are. This was probably before we started to do podcasts.
These days, I hope you've got to know me and a lot of other Fools through this podcast and all of our podcasts. But pre the Rule Breaker Investing podcasts, people will sometimes seek me out saying, ""Who is this guy, who is this Fool?"" Darren was one of them. All right. He goes on, two notes, first, ""Loved the episode on losing to win, and I can personally attest to this strategy, my long-term positions in Tesla, Netflix, Activision Blizzard, and Amazon alone have trounced my losses. My recent additions over the last three years, pre-pandemic and Robinhood stock trading of Shopify, MercadoLibre, Square, Roku, Match Group and Nvidia, Twilio, Zoom, MongoDB among others, have rewarded my patience. I forgot the name of your ratio of stocks to age."" That would be, of course, the Gardner-Kretzmann Continuum, he said, ""But mine is 1.45. I just finished Morgan Housel's book, which was further confirmation of my entire posture over the last 12 Foolish years of investing."" Another member of the 12-year club. ""I have recommended it to three friends so far."" Second note, ""I want to thank you for introducing me to positive intelligence, and the work of Shirzad Chamine, too much to write in an email. Short version, I read the book, identified saboteurs. In my case,"" Darren says. ""they were hyper-rational and hyper-vigilant, committed to the PQ exercises, raised my PQ,"" that would be his positive intelligence quotient from 48 to 92 in one month. Darren goes on, ""I eliminated the crushing daily anxiety of owning a business from my life. Personally, I'm identifying and eliminating all kinds of blind spots in my marriage, parenting and friendships. I've recommended the book to at least 10 people and I'm in a book study with four of my male friends, all of us seeing profound changes in our lives. While this may sound cultish or a ridiculous adulation for The Motley Fool, it isn't. I'm not sure how to articulate it, maybe it's this simple. I've received far more from The Fool than I have ever paid in subscription dues. For me, The Fool has far exceeded its mandate to educate, amuse, and enrich with an emphasis on enrich. Have a blessed, safe, and happy holiday. Darren from Raleigh, North Carolina."" Well, thank you very much for that, Darren.
The reason I wanted to share this one is your callout of Shirzad Chamine. Certainly, a new friend of Rule Breakers everywhere and a friend of this podcast. That was one of my Besties of 2020, Positive Intelligence with Shirzad Chamine. I'm not going to go on even to summarize it, because anybody can listen to it. All of these podcasts are available for free. This one was October 21st. But Darren, you're not the first one who's written me saying that that was a profound hour for you to listen to and a life improver for you. Since I'm a friend of yours, that means a lot to hear this coming from you. I also want to mention that I had hoped to get Shirzad onto our Besties of 2020 because that podcast certainly won a Bestie of 2020 and yet we had a miscommunication with Shirzad. He very much wanted to join. I was excited to hear from him some positive thoughts for 2021. But unfortunately, due to that snafu, we did not get to feature Shirzad, so I trust we'll get to touch base with him sometime in the new year. Anyway, thank you, Darren. All right.
Rule Breaker mailbag item No. 3, this one from another Darren, this time Darren [...], ""Hi, David. Hope you're safe and well."" Well, thank you, Darren, I am. ""I'm new to the stock market and listening to your podcast. I've really appreciated your transparency with your five-stock samplers. The fact that they are recorded, timestamped, allows people like myself to do some due diligence when trying to determine the number of people giving stock advice on the Internet. From my understanding, you hold stocks for a minimum of three years."" Well, that's right. ""I appreciate the reviews, but would be very interested to know if you sell any of those or plan on continuing to hold them after the three-years. Is there any circumstance where you would sell? Is your strategy to take a certain percentage of your income and invest every two weeks contributing to winners or hold onto the next five stock samplers? Thank you for reading my email, stay safe, happy holidays to you and your family. Darren.""
Well, I wanted to share this one for two reasons. First of all, I wanted to make it really clear, Darren and everybody, especially new listeners, that for our five-stock samplers, we play the game for three years. I've said this a few times in the past, but if we played the game for longer than that, given that we report updates every year after the five-stock sampler has been picked, so we check back in after year one, year two, year three. If I allowed these samplers to go on indefinitely and tried to keep you updated, there would be no other content on the Rule Breaker Investing podcast other than an occasional new five-stock sampler and reviews of dozens and dozens of past ones. So, what I've specifically done in 90% or more of the cases is say, we're going to do this for three years. I want to make sure you understand why we do that. I also want to make sure you understand point No. 2: absolutely, we do not plan on selling stocks that are in these five-stock samplers. All of our members, so many of whom listen to this podcast, will know that all of my five stock samplers, every one of the 135 stocks, has been picked from the services we're already using. These are all active recommendations. That's why I call them a sampler. There are small samples of Motley Fool Stock Advisor and Motley Fool Rule Breakers.
What we do in those services is typically, we've held those for years before I ever present them here on a five-stock sampler and we'll continue holding them for years after the three-year game of a given five-stock sampler concludes. Please don't think that there's any trading strategy. I'm not even sure what to call that, where you would bounce from one five-stock sampler to the next, selling out of that one before buying the next one. That is certainly not what I would do or what I intend at all from this. I think that you understand that, but sometimes it's worth putting extra time in for clarity.
Point No. 4, and we're going to continue on this subject of five-stock samplers, some fun analysis here coming in for Matt Rantala. Matt, thank you for this note. ""Dear David, thank you for the podcast and for reviewing the Five Stocks that Let You Eat Cake, which was another market beating five-stock sampler. I have been listening to the back catalog of the Rule Breaker Investing podcasts and building my own spreadsheet of your five-stock samplers as I go. Now, I'm doing this partially because I crave data, but also because of some advice I was given about learning to write. Copying verbatim the words of a master can be a helpful tool not to plagiarize, but as a form of deliberate practice. Some of your investing principles have been reinforced by systematically copying your samplers.""
By copying, I hear Matt to be saying he listens to the old podcast, he takes down the stocks in order, he types them into a spreadsheet and he tracks them, which, guess what, fellow Fools, that's exactly what I've done. I have a spreadsheet of all the past five-stock samplers, simply a homebrewed spreadsheet with some help for my assistant Milena, that we've created so we can track and report back to you for all of these many review uploads over the years. It sounds like Matt, you're on the same adventure. Well, he goes on, ""First, and this will not surprise you, is that you frequently repick some of the same stocks. Now, why is that? Probably, because winners win. The stocks that have succeeded in previous samplers are likely to be reselected because they are winning. I try to remember this,"" says Matt, ""when I hesitate to increase my position in a stock that has already increased significantly. The second principle that I've seen in action is how one big winner can overcome the losing stocks. In three of the four samplers that I have now closed out on my spreadsheet,"" says Matt, ""the one largest winner, has earned enough Alpha to make up for all the losers. A principle you often repeat, but sinks in a bit more when you see it in action. When I see some red in my portfolio, I try to remember that winners lose a lot of the time."" I'll read out just a little bit more, this one additional observation Matt adds is that, ""your selections may often be targeted for acquisition. While the sample size is still small,"" he's just reviewed the first seven samplers. He says, ""I have seen three companies that were acquired before the sampler was closed. While it's not your intention to select companies with the hope of acquisition, companies that are attractive to investors are also attractive to bigger companies."" He closes it out, ""Thank you again for the public samplers. I'll continue to copy them into Excel with the goal of continuing to become a bit smarter, happier, and richer. Fool on. Matt Rentala.""
Well, Matt, I congratulate you on taking the time to go back from the earliest days, listen to what was being said, copy it down. In so doing, as you say, by copying it out and writing it out yourself, it helps you learn better. In a lot of ways, that's why we also review them. I could just do the five-stock sampler, and then at the end of three years, just tell you how it did, which as we've mentioned earlier, would be a lot more than many other people picking stocks in popular media do. But no, we really do purpose every year to check in year one, year two, year three. You're right, some of the lessons that we're repeatedly providing here on the podcast are illustrated in that spreadsheet you're putting together. Winners win is a clear one, and you're right, I do tend to look back and repick some of the same stocks. I try to mix it up, because I don't ever want to be too samey. But MercadoLibre is probably over represented in those 27 five-stock samplers, for example.
In some cases, of the five stocks, three or even four of them were actually losers. But the one, for whatever reason did so well, that it wiped out all of the others. That's why the vast majority, over 85% of those 27 five-stock samplers have beaten the market. You're right, it comes down to often one or two big winners bringing up the whole crew. Because as much as winners win you're right, a lot of the winning companies I love, can lose for a three-year period sometimes. Sometimes we just make bad investments. Anyway, thanks so much for sharing and I was happy to share your lessons out to the whole community, Matt Rentala.
Enough for the five-stock samplers. Let's move right along now to Amit Somani, Rule Breaker mailbag, item No. 5, ""Hi, David and The Motley Fool team. I was a long time Fool from the early days after reading the Rule Breakers, Rule Makers book in the late 1990s."" I love hearing that, Amit. Thank you. ""Lost my interest, pun intended, along the way and restarted on Rule Breakers and Stock Advisor for the past few years. In 2020, so glad you guys started Motley Fool Live,"" that's live.fool.com, ""and I also discovered the awesome RBI podcast. My comment is on rerecommendations. I looked through the performance scorecard for Rule Breakers and I realized a rerecommendation appears to have a better risk-reward ratio while still crushing the S&P 500. Some of the best stocks, such as MercadoLibre and Intuitive Surgical have been rerecommended many times. A few that have been initiated and rerecommended just in the last 12-18 months, a company like Roku, let us say."" So yes, we've kept it up in the near-term as well as the long-term, Amit. You go on to say, ""In some sense, this seems akin to how a Venture Capitalist does a follow on round in a company, which is a sign of higher conviction, albeit, at a higher valuation. I'm definitely going to use this as a strong signal and would love to get your views on it, perhaps even an episode on just the rerecommended stocks and how their narratives have evolved for the better. Thank you. Happy holidays. Keep inspiring, amusing, and enriching the world. Regards, Amit Somani.""
Well, thank you, Amit, and I wanted to read this one right after Matt Rentala, because it's just reinforcing again this same point, ""Sometimes the best new stock you can buy is more of an existing stock that you have."" As I was picking two new stocks every month starting in October 2004 for the Motley Fool Rule Breakers service, somewhere about 10 or 12 years in, so this is somewhere around 2015, I decided instead of coming up with two new stocks every month, many months in the year, I would actually have one rerecommendation and one new stock, and the theory at the time was probably a rerecommendation of a company that I really like at whatever the new price is, is going to be a higher probability win for all of us than whatever I think is the second best new stock of the month. So, that subtle change was made several years ago and it's very much in keeping with what you just said, Amit, and what Matt said as well. I do think that there is power in rerecommendations, and that's why I've made a regular habit of it with Motley Fool Rule Breakers, and of course, our most popular feature of the Rule Breakers service and of Motley Fool Stock Advisor is actually the Best Buys Now that come out every month; and what are those?
But basically, rerecommendations of existing stocks that we already have in our portfolios, a new five-stock sampler every month, if you will, both in Rule Breakers and Stock Advisor. I hope all of these habits, practices, and processes, again, undergirded by constant repetition orally through this podcast, have reminded all of us of the power of going back to what works, and the rerecommendations are a great example. All right. It's poem time. Rule Breaker mailbag item No. 6. This is from frequent correspondent, Lisa John Wharton. Lisa, thank you for this note, ""Dear Rule Breaker Fools, I'm very grateful to you, the Rule Breaker team and the Stock Advisor team, and David and Tom Gardner. I had a great year. My portfolio's returned almost 90% in 2020. It's really changed my life and made me feel like writing poetry. I don't have to work anymore, and it's offered me the financial freedom that I have never dreamed of. I've written this acrostic poem, which has the following role, and I know this as an English major. As an acrostic, the first letter of each line spells out the title of the poem, which happens to be Motley Fool."" That's right. The first letter of the first line is M, the first letter of the second line is O, it spells Motley Fool right down the margin. That's the first rule. The second rule Lisa mentioned is that she has a rhyming scheme here of AA, BB, CC, DD, etc. This is optional. She says it's her choice. Third, it also has a trochaic meter, which means it has a rhythm of emphasize syllable on emphasize syllable, a trochee, if you will.
Lisa concludes, ""I might send in a Shakespearean sonnet in the next email. Sincerely, Lisa John Wharton,"" and here it goes, ""Motley Fool is what I want to cheer, Oh I have had such a gainful year. Teams, you have short give the best advice, let me write full-time and exercise. Each day, when I look at my account, yes, it has become a large amount. For me, things could be mad on Wall Street, oh a spiffy-pop is making me upbeat. Oh to buy and hold is easy, so I boast, let me offer them a sincere toast."" Well, thank you again, Lisa. Now, once again, I'm very conscious that we have a lot of us celebrating the returns that we've had this year. I just want to briefly reflect on that, reminded of one of my favorite documentary films that I saw, this one, almost 20 years old. Hoop Dreams, it turns out came out in the year 1994, which would make it more than 20 years old. It's 26 years old. Perhaps some of you have seen it. The real life story of a couple of kids who become grown men and have a dream to make the NBA. They enter college basketball, and the documentarians have followed them from the earliest days as these little kids, showing real clips of their lives all the way through, checking in with them, interviewing them. I've thought Hoop Dreams was a sensation. I think for many of us who enjoyed Hoop Dreams, there was a line there that we still remember because it broke your heart a little bit when William Gates, not that Bill Gates, no, this William Gates, when William Gates at one point in the documentary as a rising star college basketball player said this, he said, ""People always say to me when you get to the NBA, don't forget about me."" He goes on, ""Well, I should have said back if I don't make it to the NBA, don't you forget about me.""
Spoiler alert, William Gates and Arthur Agee, the two stars of Hoop Dreams, never did make the NBA. It's a haunting line, and I think it was supposed to be a haunting line. I want this line, this thought to haunt you a little bit in the year 2021 and beyond. If the stock market doesn't keep going up 90% for your portfolio next year or any of the five years after, I sure hope you won't forget about us. That you won't forget about us at The Motley Fool, because we have lived through probably the greatest stock market year. Most of us will see, maybe for the rest of our lives, but certainly for the near-term. I mentioned Tesla earlier. It started the year below $100, it's over $600. How about The Trade Desk? That stock is up 250% since the year started as of this recording anyway. MongoDB, ticker symbol MDB, has spiffy-popped a few times in December for a lot of members. It's nearly a triple. Ever heard of a little company called Zoom Video Communications? I bet a lot of you have, and it might be in your portfolio, I sure hope it is. That stock is up 500%, that's six times in value just this calendar year.
These are not normal times, Fools. I think we all know that 2020 was not a normal year in just about every way, but I sure hope, along with William Gates, that years from now, if you don't manage to score a five-bagger on your brand new pick eight months later, that you'll still remember us and you won't forget. Some of my status conversations will be casual cocktail-hour conversations where somebody will say, ""Yeah, I followed you guys back in the 1990s,"" but then there's nothing really after that, and that would be somebody who, when 2001 hit and everybody's stock sold off, they lost the love for the stock market altogether and then they are the cocktail party. Once we get back to cocktail parties, telling me that they don't really do it anymore. They burned out on the market drop in 2001. Well, the market dropped again in 2008, '09. It had a really big drop in the fourth quarter of 2018, it had a horrific drop in the first quarter of this year. But take it all in all, and you will take it all in all, wouldn't you? Because it has been a spectacular run. Whether we're charting it from 2001-2008 or 2015 through to today, it has been incredible. Please know these times are not normal. You will probably not see an IPO market where stocks will tend to double on their first day in 2021 or 2022 or beyond, and it's very unlikely that your favorite stocks in mind will multi-bag in the course of a single calendar year. Now, I'm not saying I don't want it to happen. I would love to see it keep happening forever, but the mathematician inside me, the Fool, I hope the wise Fool inside me and the friend of yours that's inside me wants you to know that these are very unusual times. So, with William Gates, I'm going to say once again, I hope you will still remember us even when markets drop.
All right, Rule Breaker mailbag item No. 7, this is from Jeremy Nichols. Jeremy says, ""Dear David, I've been enormously enriched by you and your team and your ongoing dedication to making financial literacy and wisdom fun and engaging. Thanks to you, as I approach the end of 2020 and the close of my 40th year on this planet. I'm glad to report that I have 11 times my annual gross salary in my retirement and brokerage accounts."" Wow, congratulations, Jeremy. Your annual salary, you multiply that and you have more than 10 times that saved and invested. That makes me a very happy co-founder of The Motley Fool. Jeremy goes on, ""I first stumbled across The Motley Fool when I was 23 years old and delivering pizza, where I used to listen to audio books every Friday and Saturday night while I drove to earn extra money. I stumbled across The Motley Fool investment guide, a multi-CD set at the public library next to the Blockbuster video in 2004,"" you know I'm loving this Jeremy, ""From you and your brother I learned that it was possible to beat the market averages. Inspired by you, I decided to step away from the 'financial advisor,' who was actually an insurance salesperson, and began to manage my own Roth IRA. I will say that I've made my fair share of mistakes along the way, often selling too soon and missing out on larger gains. For instance, I'm one of those who sold out of Netflix at the Qwikster announcement and who didn't buy Apple, Google [Alphabet], or Amazon until 2016, thinking they were overvalued and all the growth already behind them. How foolish of me? Most of my investments were small, until I made the decision to leave my employer of 12 years in the year 2016 and take a new role. This allowed me to transfer my 401(k) and Roth 401(k) investments, totaling about 1.5X my annual salary to a discount broker and began to make sizable investing decisions on my own. I want to emphasize this point, because the gains that I have achieved would have been impossible within the confines of a conventional retirement plan,"" and I'm reading that slower and my voice should be bolding the text in your ears because that's an important point that Jeremy is making here.
This is not to say, by the way, that retirement plans can, even conventional ones aren't valuable, they really are. But many of them, many people are operating in offices or workplaces where their only choice in their 401(k) is to pick from a small menu of mutual funds. Sometimes, those mutual funds overcharge for underperformance, which leads to pretty paltry returns for a lot of the people following those plans over the course of time. We've always favored just a Vanguard S&P 500 index fund or the total market index fund if you have only mutual funds in your retirement plan. But most of all, we celebrate those who take the extra step and open up a Roth IRA or within their corporate IRA. Sometimes, they have the freedom to invest in individual stocks. Indeed, Jeremy, I think that's when you really set yourself up for some spectacular long term success of the kind that you've achieved. Let me continue his note, ""The decision to leave that job of 12 years was not motivated by this factor, but more than any other, this has been responsible for the improvement in my family's financial life. I was able to go from a 6%-10% a year return with the funds within that plan, to a compound annual growth rate of 56%,"" Wow, ""since the end of 2016. Here are three lessons I've learned from you and your team. One, how to take a punch in the portfolio."" Jeremy says, ""Since I started tracking seriously, I have had what I consider three serious hits to my portfolio value. In December 2018, I experienced a 29% drawdown from an all-time high."" Yeah, I remember that fourth quarter of 2018. ""In September 2019, it was a 32% drawdown from an all-time high. Then again in March 2020, March of this year, I experienced a 41% drawdown. These are not fun, but going through these has helped my long-term perspective. I also actually appreciate checking my account balances in these situations, as it helps acclimate me emotionally so that I can start to overcome the natural bias, to experience pain at loss that is three times the happiness of my gains. I am also harking back to your saying, David, that the market goes down faster than it goes up, but it always goes up more than it goes down, and Chris Hill's saying is also helpful. That when you are suffering outsized losses, you are paying the dues required to get outsized gains. After each drop, I found myself with less panic and having made fewer impulsive decisions.""
Well, wow. Before I go on to conclude with his last two points, think about that, fellow Fools everywhere. Three consecutive years in a row at one point, Jeremy had experienced drops of 29%, 32%, and 41%, and held all the way through. A lot of people don't want to see a drop like that more than once in a decade. Admittedly, some of our Rule Breaker stocks have, in some cases, extreme volatility. Think about companies like Tesla to the upside and the downside. You can see how these drops could happen and certainly do with the Rule Breaker investing approach. But learning to take it, as Jeremy says, to take a punch in the portfolio is so valuable. ""Lesson No. 2, asset location, location, location."" He says, ""This one is from Robert Brokamp,"" the long time host of Motley Fool Answers along with Alison Southwick, as well as the Rule Your Retirement guru, and yes, Robert, you're a guru. ""This one's from Robert Brokamp, who's shared that your Roth account should be where you house the portions of your portfolio you expect to grow the most. Taking advantage of the long-term tax-free nature of gains in this account. This has been a great lesson coming into 2020 because in 2019, I sold Roth positions in larger, slower growing companies, and bought those same shares back in my IRA and vice-versa, to shift my expected biggest winners to my Roth. This led to a Roth which is loaded up with all stars like The Trade Desk, Datadog, CrowdStrike, Cloudflare, Pinterest, Sea Limited, Livongo, now Teladoc, and Roku. These have led to a compound annual growth rate in my Roth of 76% since January 2017.""
Finally, Jeremy's third lesson, ""Play great games, win great prizes."" He says, ""This is the opposite of play stupid games, wins stupid prizes. I remember a Rule Breaker podcast where you talked about investing and the world of business as a game, where you are playing against the whole world. You can win financial independence as your prize depending on your performance. I wanted to thank you for that analogy as it truly has made investing more fun. This is only scratching the surface. In conclusion of how The Fool has made me smarter, happier and richer since I first dip my toes in the water with you more than 15 years ago, I would like to thank you for introducing me to this game. Well, thanks to good choices from your universal picks, I've been able to win a most excellent prize. Best wishes, Merry Christmas, and a happy New Year to you and yours, Jeremy Nichols."" Merry Christmas and a Foolish New Year to you, Jeremy.
Rule Breaker mailbag item No. 8. Do you see why I said our mailbag was stuffed this month? ""Hi, David."" This one comes from Sydney Steel. ""Hi, David. You just made my year with your games episode. I'm a huge gamer. I met my husband at a mutual friend's New Year's Eve gaming marathon a couple of years ago. I appreciate you sharing your love of games with the greater investing world. May I suggest another way for you and your listeners to indulge in gaming? Just like your fabulous suite of podcasts, shout out to Motley Fool Money"", says Sydney Steel, ""gaming has its own plethora of them. I will start with my husband's conversational gaming podcast, Tabletop Game Talk, or TGT for short."" Sure, Sydney, I'll give a plug here. TabletopGametalk.com is their website, and they've got a podcast. ""Or the weekly gaming news podcast, Dice Tower News,"" which I've certainly seen a lot of over the years on, ""which my husband has a recurring Kickstarters segment."" Well, I think she is referring to all of the games these days that get kick started to come out on Kickstarter, and it sounds like her husband, Chris Steel, is the one who monitors what's happening on Kickstarter and does a Dice Tower News segment. She goes on to say, ""In another segment, they look at the top 10 games on the boardgamegeek.com hotness list. Both of those podcasts are in the network of podcasts called the Dice Tower Network, which has an incredible amount of gaming content over multiple different platforms. Look them up and game on."" Then she ends with, ""I mean, Fool on,"" with a smiley.
Well, thank you very much, Sydney Steel. I really appreciate you letting us know. Not only are you a Motley Fool podcast fan, but you were also part of a great gaming couple. I wish you and your husband, Chris, the very gaming best. I'm delighted to know that he is helping more people find great games, whether it's on Kickstarter or on BoardgameGeek. I'm just delighted to be in touch with fellow gamers. So, thanks for writing in, Sydney. Good luck, Chris. Fool on!
All right. Rule Breaker mailbag item No. 9, ""Dear David, I will be celebrating my fifth anniversary of being a Motley Fool member in March of this coming year. But in the spirit of Thanksgiving, I wanted to express my huge thanks to you and all of The Motley Fool for transforming my financial life. As of today, the worth of my portfolio has tripled, yes, tripled, since March of 2016, when I bought my first Motley Fool services, which were Motley Fool Options and Motley Fool Stock Advisor. During these 4+ years, I've subscribed to several other Fool services, including Rule Breakers and a few Fool portfolio services. I began as an investing illiterate, and I've learned so much. It's been a tremendous fund, not to speak of tremendously profitable. I came to The Motley Fool because the asset management company that I was with, a wonderful socially responsible assessment management service, alerted me that if I kept up the spending as I was doing, I would be out of money in 10 to 12 years."" Carol Davies writes, ""They actually did quite well for me, but given the fact that my portfolio is virtually my soul source of income for living, it wasn't enough. Now, I don't have to be concerned about figuring out how to cut my expenses, thanks to The Motley Fool. I hope one day to meet you and Tom so I can thank you in person, but for now, thank you, thank you, thank you to you, Tom and your wonderful team of analysts whom I've gotten to know through the community boards."" Those, of course, are our discussion boards, which we make ample use of on our site through their articles on the services, and now, of course, through Motley Fool Live, which Carol Davies says she loves.
""I also listen each week to the Rule Breaker Investing podcast. You're always engaging, bringing so much investing and living knowledge for free to so many people. With best wishes for success and bliss in bringing these wonderful investing principles and the profits that go with them, including benefiting our whole world in a socially responsible way to our whole world family."" Signed, Carol Davies. Carol concludes with, ""Forgot to say, I did leave that asset management company in March 2016, and I went totally on my own, solely with the Motley Fool's help. The triple value of my portfolio does not include all the options income from applying the Motley Fool Options from people like Jim Mueller, Jim Gillies, Jeff Fischer, all of their principles and the stocks that are sold to cover my living expenses these years. So, if I included that, the value would be significantly more than triple, all thanks to The Motley Fool."" Carol, you know how happy notes like that make us. I hope you heard my line earlier from Hoop Dreams, which I've co-opted for the purpose of this podcast at the end of it all, to remember to pinch yourself, because there will not be many years or many four-year periods like the one we've just seen, but of course, eyeswide-open, I continue to think, hey, I think the market is going to go up next year.
All right. Rule Breakers mailbag item No. 10, ""Dear David, a year ago, I wrote to you about how my wife and I recently had given a perhaps unique wedding gift. Instead of buying the equivalent of a lovely set of candle sticks off the registry, we instead opened a brokerage account for the bride and groom. We started it out with single shares of 16 different companies. So, one share each, 16 companies, all but two of which traded at under $100, worth about $1,000 in total."" Well, what a generous, wonderful thought for a wedding gift. I think it's about to get better, let's listen. ""The intent of the gift was education. Our hope was that the young couple, with decades of compounding ahead of them, would watch these small, diversified positions and learn. We couldn't help hoping that, as they added to this little portfolio, it might be the acorn that grows into something bigger than they ever thought possible, and the wedding gift that makes the biggest difference in their lives. Well, I write to give you an update. This month, the young couple and their little portfolio celebrate their first anniversaries. The bride and I have been in touch several times a month, all year. New all-time highs were a reason to text screenshots of stock charts. Ends of quarters caused an email reminder to calculate performance against the S&P because, of course, we keep score. This week we sat down over Zoom to review their positions in the past year. The S&P 500 is up about 15% since the portfolio's inception, and the couple is up 40% after adjusting for the $50 a month they have added to the account. Infused with Foolish companies and a Foolish approach, the little portfolio has grown from $1,000 to about $2,300 over the year. Their biggest winners are Etsy, Teladoc, Match Group, and PayPal, up variously as high as 245% to as low as just +85%. Their biggest loser is DAL."" Well, that's certainly not one of my picks. I'm pretty sure that's Delta Airlines, but I'm not looking at the internet right now. ""DAL down 35%. They've added to winners. They've bought an additional share of Teladoc, and of eBay. They've seen one holding, Dunkin, as in Dunkin Donuts. Dunkin Holdings gets taken private for a 40% gain. They experienced their first bear market in March, a psychological test for any investors, seasoned or novice. They did not sell, but found the courage to buy, adding a share of Microsoft and Hospital Corp of America to their portfolio during those dark days.""
""Then, they observed how markets go down faster than they go up, but go up more than they go down. I am somewhat chagrined,"" says our correspondent, ""to report their performance over those 12 months is beating my own on a percentage basis. I'm forced to smile when I look over the list of companies that didn't make the cut for my original buy list, which included Square and Zoom, up three and six times respectively over the past year. With modesty, I have to rate this experiment an unqualified success. I feel like this young couple is on their way financially. They have good habits in terms of being savers. They are responsible about debt. They think in terms of the long term and they are learning about investing. I end with the same request as last year. If you end up using the story on the podcast, please make us anonymous. My hope is that other listeners might consider doing something similar for young couples in their lives. With gratitude,"" and I'm going to sign it, anonymous.
Well, as that is a Motley Fool member whom I've met before, I congratulate you, Sir, on what you've done. I love that story and I was so pleased to share it with our worldwide audience because the idea of giving a stock or a small portfolio as a wedding gift instead of candlesticks, I like my candlesticks but wow, what a valuable contribution. Beyond just giving the money or the stocks, of course, it was your attention. It was the hand holding through some really bad times in March and April, it was your thought in the first place of what 16 diversified companies that they would like, could I get them? Then of course, your regular check-ins, whether on a monthly or a celebratory quarterly basis, that was worth its weight in gold. Congratulations to you, Sir, and to all of those whose lives you touch. Happy anniversary, bride and groom. All right.
Well, for our last two points, we have one silly and one sublime, let's do them in that order. Rule Breaker mailbag, item No. 11, this one from Eric Eason, ""Hi, David and Rick. I began daydreaming as you spoke in the recent Rule Breaker podcast about your high school lead role in the musical The Music Man, because I was the stage right spotlight crew on that musical during my sophomore year of high school. We had some exciting technical difficulties, including all of the power for the stage lighting going out during the Mayor's soliloquy in that musical from which the three spotlights saved the play by flooding the stage with our light,"" Eric goes on, ""but the most enjoyable memory for me was during one of the last performances, after which I had grown comfortable with the play and my role. Again, I was a spotlight newbie. My spotlight, we knew, had a damaged fresnel lens, and so I had to turn it off whenever it wasn't in use to protect the lens from overheating, which could break it. At one point, my spotlight had a longest pause in the play so I turned it off, leaned back against the wall and simply enjoyed the show."" Eric continues, ""Well, after a bit, I heard some really good acapella harmonies far off stage which gradually, ever so gradually, grew louder. I was thoroughly enjoying it when suddenly, I realized with the shock, 'Oh no, that's my queue.' I rolled my spotlight onto the edge of the stage right curtains, set my aperture, turned on my spotlight, and prayed I was on target and on queue. Thankfully, I was spot on with both for my beam illuminated the lead barbershop quartet singer as he emerged on stage, followed by his companions. Well now, here's the wonderful serendipitous twist to the story. Just as I was daydreaming of the barbershop quartet stepping onto stage with my fortuitously aimed and timed spotlight, your producer, Rick Engdahl, speaks up on the podcast to say, ""Hey, I was in The Music Man too, David, I was in the barbershop quartet. Well, I burst out laughing with glee and shouted, ""Rick, I've got you covered, my good man. Here's a toast to small world stories and the stories of redemption like The Music Man."" Signed, Eric Eason. Through my headphones, my producer Rick is telling me he thinks it was probably Lida Rose. I remember that, to Lida Rose, old Lida Rose. Yeah, they came on slowly, and then it got bigger, louder, and faster. That's a beautiful song. Thank you, Eric Eason.
At the end of it all, well, here's the end mailbag item from Zach Kennely. ""Greetings, David. The Motley Fool has changed my life and made me and my family smarter, happier, and richer. I subscribed to multiple Motley Fool services like Rule Breakers, Stock Advisors, Marijuana Masters, and Blast Off 2020. In partnership with The Fool, our portfolio is up 88% in just the last year. The Motley Fool has made our family smarter. We now deeply analyze present and future economic trends with an eye for how excellent businesses can capitalize on those trends. We ask curious questions like the questions at the end of this mailbag message. The Motley Fool has made our family happier. As a result of our investing, we now have the savings rate up more than 25%, up from less than 10% before becoming investors in individual stocks. Investing with The Motley Fool has taught me how to think about money by playing the long game and prioritizing what we want most over what we want now. We've begun communicating effectively about money, finance, and investing. A ripple effect is happening in our circle of influence, inspiring investing across three generations of our family. The Motley Fool has made our family richer. My wife and I are both teachers in Denver, Colorado. We are not rich. Though we are now on the path to financial independence through a strong savings rate, we spread our passion for saving and investing throughout our community. We are also bringing our passion for investing to our students, helping our community to understand that building a more equitable world is about more than just earning money, it is about investing that money and compounding it into wealth, which can be used to create the world they envision. It is not an exaggeration to say that The Motley Fool has truly changed the trajectory of my life, the lives of my family members, and even more incredibly, the lives of those in our circle of influence. I've been an educator for 10 years. In August of 2018, I was an initial responder to a shooting at my school. A student that I had worked with for many years had been shot in the head at school. Miraculously, because of this middle schooler's incredible tenacity, he is alive and living a fulfilling life today. As a result of this experience, I struggled with post-traumatic stress for some time, yet the darkness of post-traumatic stress has only been a small part of the story for me. The real story for me has been the profound personal post-traumatic growth I have experienced as a result of this humbling experience. Through this experience, I've grown as a husband, a father, a son, a brother, a friend, and community member. At the root of that growth has been me discovering my passion for investing, ignited by The Motley Fool. This brings me to the framing of my question for you, 2020 has been deeply traumatic for America. We are in the throes of a life altering COVID-19 pandemic, significant civil unrest, as contentious an election as my generation has seen ever, and growing inequality. Do you think it is possible that out of the trauma of 2020, America and the world may be prime for an explosion of post-traumatic growth? If America is primed to experience post traumatic growth in our post-vaccine world, then what industries and/or trends ride the wave and win the day as a result of America's post-2020 traumatic growth? Thank you for taking the time to read my mailbag letter. I'm truly grateful to be a Foolish investor and for everything The Motley Fool brings to the world. Grateful, Zach Kennely.""
Well, Zach, thank you for that beautiful note, and a big part of me was tempted to just cut it off right at the end of your story and not address the question because it was such a beautiful story. Talk about making lemonade out of lemons, what a wonderful reflection on what happened to you on that hard, hard day to say nothing of your students some years ago and how you both have turned it into a win. Just hearing about the success that you're having for your family and your community brings a huge smile to my face and I know so many people listening to me right now.
But you did ask a question and it was a question from a great place, a place of optimism. A place that asks, what about post-traumatic growth? What about the possibilities there? Well, my word for a long while now, for months now, for 2021, I've said it on this podcast, my word for 2021 is ""comeback."" That always has a little bit of a sports lilt to me as a sports fan. But you don't need to be a sports fan to recognize the beauty of comebacks. You've lived one yourself. As I think about the comeback in store for our society, I think about a society that has more conscious leadership. I've already said, one of my favorite books this year was Conscious Leadership by John Mackey. Had them on the podcast, had them again on the podcast, just to double underline that. One of the things that you learned is that a conscious leader is the best leader, the leader that you and I want, whether it's in the White House, in the corporate boardroom, or the heads of the households for every family across the world, what you want in that leadership is people who can find win, win, win.
As I asked myself what are some of the industries or the leaders that will create value in a post traumatic world of growth, I think it's going to be the conscious ones. That's why so many of our stocks, they are in the five stock samplers, they're in our services, our conscious capitalism companies, companies that recognize that holding a purpose above profits is the best way for that organization to thrive and the secret is often, they get the most profits too. Yes, they're managing for wins for all of their stakeholders. What I love about this answer is it's not just true of an industry or a certain trend or a tech trend that somebody is looking at, I like to look across the broad swath of all of business and say, where are the conscious leaders? Where are the people doing good things in this world and creating a lot of value for everyone around them? I know I'm talking to one right now, Zach Kennely, because you are that for your family and your community, that's the growth I'm investing in. Thank you. Thank you to all my fellow Fools everywhere for a most remarkable year, 2020. Here we are, now truly at the end of it all. Fool on!

2021-01-09 00:00:00+00:00,3 Timeless Stock Investing Lessons to Beat the Market in 2021,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-timeless-stock-investing-lessons-to-beat-the-market-in-2021-2021-01-09,,,"The start of a new year is always a good time to improve your finances Whether you outperformed the market in 2020, did OK, or had a year you'd rather forget, 2021 offers a clean slate to learn from your mistakes and the wisdom of others.
Books can be great resources for sharpening your investing skills. The following three titles are amusing and enriching with timeless investing lessons that will help you beat the market this year and for decades to come.
Image source: Getty Images.
For new investors: One Up on Wall Street by Peter Lynch
Timeless lesson: Regular people can beat the market by investing in businesses they understand better than Wall Street.
Lynch's thesis runs parallel to our beliefs here at the Motley Fool. We think you can outperform the market, and we want to help you do just that.
Written in 1989, the examples in One Up on Wall Street are outdated, but their sentiment is still applicable today. Lynch simplifies the stock market and reminds investors that stocks are companies with real businesses. His grassroots approach is grounded in the belief that regular people can make money in the stock market by investing in businesses they understand.
For example, a graphic designer is likely to have a better understanding of Adobe's (NASDAQ: ADBE) popular products like Photoshop and Illustrator than an analyst on Wall Street. Adobe was still a relatively small company in 2010. It introduced a software bundle known as Adobe Creative Cloud in 2011 which it then made available as a subscription in 2013. Adobe users could have seen firsthand the appeal and potential of this cloud-based offering in its early days. Now, we know the results are astounding -- Adobe stock has increased about 1,400% over the past 10 years, what Lynch would call ""a 14 bagger."" And the stock remains an excellent recession-ready stock to buy right now.
Data by YCharts.
Lynch-style opportunities are often hiding in plain sight. Another good example is Disney+. The long-anticipated release of Walt Disney's (NYSE: DIS) streaming service came in Nov. 2019, which just so happened to be a few months before one of the deadliest pandemics in U.S. history. Kids out of school and parents adjusting to social-distancing measures made the rise of Disney+ fairly predictable.
The stock was trading near a five-year low in March, because its theme park and feature film revenue evaporated in the wake of COVID-19. Lynch would note that you didn't need any special financial knowledge to realize that these revenue streams would probably rebound long term whereas Disney+ had the potential to explode in popularity with years of growth ahead of it.
For value investors: The Dhandho Investor by Mohnish Pabrai
Timeless lesson: The market isn't perfectly efficient, and it misprices assets all the time. Identifying and buying distressed assets at bargain prices is the essence of value investing.
2020 encapsulated the lessons in Pabrai's 2007 book, The Dhandho Investor. As a value investor, Pabrai is all about paying less for a business than what it's worth. He's a believer in waiting patiently for opportunities to arise and then making big bets.
The spring 2020 stock market crash priced several leading companies like they were distressed assets. Identifying the companies that dominate their industry and then betting heavily on them was a winning strategy. The meteoric rise of Tesla and Shopify, for example, was shadowed by the incredible rebound of other market-leading companies. Major airlines like Southwest and Delta have both more than doubled from their 2020 lows. After crashing to multiyear depths, several value stocks reached all-time highs in 2020.
However, Pabrai is also perfectly fine with buying a company at an all-time high if he believes its runway is much longer than the market gives it credit for. He was an advocate of Chipotle (NYSE: CMG), which had just 500 stores in 2006 and was gaining popularity for its fresh ingredients, low prices, and customizable menu. Pabrai chose it over any other Mexican restaurant in Southern California. And he discovered firsthand that others did too. Similar to Peter Lynch, Pabrai noted that it didn't take a genius to figure out Chipotle could seriously scale its business. Chipotle stock has increased by 3,000% since 2006, and the company now has over 2,500 restaurants.
Data by YCharts.
For growth investors: Zero to One by Peter Thiel
Timeless Lesson: The most successful businesses are monopolies that combine proprietary technology with network effects, economies of scale, and branding. Today's largest tech companies began as start-ups that identified and eventually dominated an emerging market with little to no competition.
Unlike Lynch and Pabrai, Thiel is a venture capitalist who finds high-growth businesses in new industries. Thiel was a co-founder of PayPal and an early investor in Facebook. He argues the success of both companies stemmed from their ability to start small in an untapped market. Facebook began by creating a social network for Harvard students. Only after that success did it branch out to other college campuses and eventually, throughout the world. PayPal started as a payment service that could process transactions over email. Its first big partner was eBay. A few high-volume sellers dominated most transactions on eBay and desperately needed PayPal's services. It was a perfect fit.
Thiel's views are somewhat contrarian, but they make a lot of sense, especially in today's tech-centric world. Technology has been the best-performing sector over the past 15 years and currently comprises over 25% of the S&P 500 index. Thiel notes that ""it's always a red flag when entrepreneurs talk about getting 1% of a $100 billion market."" Instead, he believes in creating new markets as Amazon did with its online bookstore, Microsoft with personal computers, and Apple with the iPhone.
In the real world outside economic theory, every business is successful exactly to the extent that it does something others cannot. Monopoly is therefore not a pathology or an exception. Monopoly is the condition of every successful business.
Theil's views apply to some of the greatest growth stories of 2020 such as CrowdStrike's rise in the cybersecurity industry and Zoom's leadership in videoconferencing, among others.
You can beat the market
Lynch, Pabrai, and Thiel are all very different investors, but they share the fundamental belief that (with the right tools and approach) you can beat the market. They also all believe the future is more important than the present or the past; long-term investing is better than trading; and future results are more important than short-term success or failure. Applying these fundamental principles to your investing strategy should lead you to become a better investor and help you ultimately beat the market.

2021-01-07 00:00:00+00:00,Why PayPal Stock Climbed 116% in 2020,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-paypal-stock-climbed-116-in-2020-2021-01-07,,,"What happened
Shares of PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ: PYPL) delivered a return of 116% last year, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence.
The stock price initially plunged in March at the onset of the pandemic, but as people increasingly turned to using digital payments, engagement across PayPal's core platform and its Venmo peer-to-peer payment app accelerated, and investors took notice.
Image source: Getty Images.
So what
PayPal started the year posting a modest increase in revenue of 13% year over year, excluding currency changes during the first quarter. But revenue growth accelerated to 25% in each of the last two quarters, with growth in total payment volume reaching a robust 38% in the third quarter.
PayPal's growing user base of 361 million active customer accounts has made it a digital payments juggernaut. Over the course of the year, the company continued its strategy to expand its capabilities and brand ubiquity by introducing new services.
In January of 2020, PayPal completed the $4 billion acquisition of Honey Science, providing consumers online shopping tools that save them money at checkout.
Later in the year, PayPal rolled out its contactless QR code technology, taking a big step to expand its addressable market to in-store payments.
Now what
In the short term, eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY) is transitioning away from PayPal to its own managed payments solution. Management anticipates this headwind to ding fourth-quarter revenue growth by two points, since eBay represents 7% of PayPal's payment volume. But there are opportunities elsewhere to fill the void.
One opportunity is Venmo, which is posting impressive growth and now comprises 18% of PayPal's total payment volume. Management now expects Venmo to contribute $900 million to the company's total revenue in 2021.
What's more, PayPal has demonstrated it can deliver tremendous growth in profits even while reinvesting in marketing, engineering, and technological capabilities to support growth. Adjusted earnings grew 41% year over year in the third quarter, and analysts expect PayPal to grow earnings by 23% annualized over the next five years.

2021-01-07 00:00:00+00:00,Why Farfetch Jumped 16.8% in December,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-farfetch-jumped-16.8-in-december-2021-01-07,,,"What happened
Shares of Farfetch (NYSE: FTCH) rose 16.8% in December, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence, on a rally that really began in November, after it was reported that Alibaba Group Holding (NYSE: BABA) was considering investing $300 million in the online luxury platform.
It was subsequently confirmed the Chinese e-commerce giant would be investing in Farfetch, but would be doing so with luxury goods company Richemont (OTC: CFRUY), and that the total amount would actually be over $1.1 billion.
The three companies will form a joint venture called Farfetch China.
Image source: Getty Images.
So what
This represents a massive opportunity for Farfetch. Chinese consumers account for one-third of luxury goods sales globally, and they're expected to represent half of the market by 2025.
Farfetch is not a retailer itself, but rather provides a marketplace for hundreds of luxury retailers and brands to connect with consumers. In that way, it is more like eBay, where third-party sellers go to hawk their wares, than Amazon, which sells goods, though it does also offer a platform and storefronts for retailers.
FTCH data by YCharts
Now what
Farfetch is still a loss-generating company and through the first nine months of 2020 has recorded over $1 billion in cumulative net losses.
The investments by Alibaba and Richemont, plus the joint venture, should help the luxury goods platform continue with its expansion while providing an infusion of cash to keep it moving forward.

On its face, $600 may not seem like a lot of money, but over the years it can grow significantly -- particularly when invested in undervalued stocks. Two stocks that are trading at modest earnings multiples are Merck (NYSE: MRK) and eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY). Together, they can be the building blocks of your portfolio for many years. And in addition to being cheap buys, they also pay dividends and can deliver recurring income to your portfolio.

1. Merck
Healthcare company Merck struggled in 2020, with its stock falling more than 10% while the S&P 500 rose 16%. Although the company's performance during COVID-19 hasn't been awful, the results also haven't been good enough to get the stock rallying, either.
On Oct. 27, the New Jersey-based company released its third-quarter results for the period ending Sept. 30, and sales of $12.6 billion were up just 1% year over year. Its flagship cancer-fighting drug Keytruda remained a source of strong growth for the company, rising by 21%. However, sales from Gardasil, its human papillomavirus vaccine, were down 10% as the company blamed lower demand due to the pandemic. In total, management expects that COVID-19 will negatively impact its top line by approximately $2.35 billion for the full fiscal year, which is higher than the $1.95 billion it projected earlier in the year.
But some good news came from its animal health segment, which grew at a rate of 9% year over year. With pet ownership on the rise in 2020, this tailwind will likely endure.
With certain segments still generating growth despite the headwinds from the pandemic, there's reason to be optimistic that the stock could turn things around as early as this year. And over the long term, its sales could climb even higher. In November, Merck acquired biotech company VelosBio for $2.75 billion to expand its oncology portfolio. VelosBio owns VLS-101, an early-stage drug targeted to treat mantle cell lymphoma that has received orphan drug and fast track designation from the Food and Drug Administration.
Today, the stock trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 18. That's cheap given that investors are paying 27 times earnings for the average stock on the S&P 500.
For value investors, this healthcare stock could be a great buy due to its value and its potential to bounce back this year. Getting it at this cheap of a price can help position you for some great returns over the long run. And with a dividend yield of 3.2% (the S&P 500 average is roughly 1.6%), it can pad your returns even further.
2. eBay
E-commerce stock eBay is coming off a decent year in 2020, rising 39% in value as the pandemic led to a surge in online shopping. And that's a trend that isn't necessarily slowing down. When the California-based company released its third-quarter earnings on Oct. 28, it reported annual active buyers of 183 million for the period ending Sept. 30 -- up 5% from 174 million reported in March.
Its net revenue through the first nine months of the year totaled $7.4 billion, growing at a rate of 15.7% from the prior-year period. And those strong top-line results trickled down through to earnings where eBay reported a year-to-date operating income of $2 billion -- up 47.5% from the same period a year ago. Even with the sale of its classified business and StubHub, the company is still generating solid growth numbers from its core business -- its online marketplace.
But despite the company's strong performance recently and its rise in value, it's still a cheap stock to own. At a P/E of 15, it's even cheaper than Merck. And it looks like an even better bargain when compared to other e-commerce stocks. Shopify barely makes a profit and has a P/E of more than 700 while Etsy trades at close to 100 times its earnings.
Although the pandemic definitely gave online shopping a boost in 2020, it's not a trend that's likely to go anywhere but up over the long term. According to research from eMarketer, retail e-commerce sales in the U.S. are expected to rise to more than $1.2 trillion by 2024, up from $795 billion in 2020. By then, they'll make up more than 19% of all retail sales compared to over 14% this past year. eBay is proving that it still plays a key role in that growth and can benefit from those buying habits, making it an excellent investment that can generate strong returns for your portfolio for many years to come. As a bow on top, the stock also pays a dividend that currently yields 1.3%.
