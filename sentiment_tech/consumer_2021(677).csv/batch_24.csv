2021-04-01 00:00:00+00:00,Here's the Next Stock I'm Going to Buy,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/heres-the-next-stock-im-going-to-buy-2021-04-01,,,"We all invest for different reasons, and we all have different goals, metrics, and ways to narrow down our research in the process of buying a new stock. Like most investors, when I add a new position to my portfolio, I do a significant amount of due diligence to determine if the investment is warranted.
To me, there is one stock out there right now that checks off all my boxes and looks like a great buy: Synchrony Financial (NYSE: SYF). Here is why this credit card issuer is the next stock Iʻm going to buy.
Image source: Getty Images.
Good value
Synchrony Financial is the 10th-largest credit card issuer in the U.S., with a 2% market share. Synchrony is different from other credit issuers -- banks that provide the loans for credit card purchases -- in that it primarily offers store-branded credit cards, those that can only be used for purchases at that specific store, with rewards and benefits as an incentive.
The bank offers more than 100 store cards, including the Amazon.com Store Card, used only for Amazon purchases. It has cards with American Eagle, Gap, Walmart, and Midas, to name a few. It also has around 30 cards that are store-branded but are part of the Visa or Mastercard networks, so they can be used anywhere. These include offerings for PayPal, Banana Republic, and eBay.
Last year was a rough one for Synchrony due to the pandemic and the resulting economic shutdowns across the U.S. Consumer spending was down for a variety of reasons, from closed stores to lost jobs. Consequently, Synchrony saw earnings plummet in the first three quarters of the year.
But they did recover in the fourth quarter to $738 million, a slight increase from the fourth quarter of 2019. It was due to essentially flat purchase volume on the cards, lower provision of credit losses due to the improving economy, and an aggressive expense reduction initiative in 2020 that lowered expenses by 7% year over year. As a result, the stock price surged in the fourth quarter and finished the year essentially flat.
That positive momentum has carried over into 2021, as the stock is up about 17% through Wednesday's close. The first-quarter gains are due to the improving economic conditions, buoyed by the stimulus and the rollout of vaccines, which have generated more consumer spending. Still, the stock remains a solid value, trading at about 18 times earnings with a price-to-book ratio of 2.
Good financials, and catalysts
Another reason I like Synchrony is its solid financials. As it is an online bank, it has no branch offices and relatively low overhead, which results in high operating margins, lots of cash flow, and a low efficiency ratio of 37%. The efficiency ratio measures expenses compared to revenue, so a lower efficiency ratio means the company is spending less in relation to revenue earned. That produces a high operating margin of 37% and a substantial amount of cash flow, roughly $7.5 billion.
This is a sturdy financial foundation on which to grow, as consumer spending is expected to take off in 2021, mainly toward the latter half of the year and into 2022. Synchrony has also been steadily adding new partners. It signed 25 new deals in 2020, including with Walgreens, Verizon, and Venmo, which is PayPalʻs mobile payments app. The Venmo Visa card, in particular, could be a significant revenue driver for Synchrony, given its huge (roughly 47 million) and growing number of users. In addition to the card, it has a QR code for contactless payments in store.
It is no wonder that analysts are bullish on Synchrony, given its financials and value, along with the improving macroeconomic picture and major catalysts. This looks like the next stock Iʻm going to buy.

2021-04-01 00:00:00+00:00,Better Fintech Stock: Square vs. Adyen,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/better-fintech-stock%3A-square-vs.-adyen-2021-04-01,,,"Square (NYSE: SQ) is often a top stock for fintech investors. The online payments company went public at just $9 in late 2015, and is now worth roughly $210 per share with a market cap of $97 billion.
However, investors might be less familiar with Square's European counterpart Adyen (OTC: ADYE.Y), which went public at 240 euros in 2018. Its Amsterdam-listed shares now trade at nearly 1,900 euros ($2,240), valuing the company at more than 57 billion euros ($67 billion).
Over the past 12 months, Square's stock has surged about 300% as Adyen's stock has risen roughly 150%. Square has clearly been the mightier growth stock, but will it keep outperforming Adyen this year?
Image source: Getty Images.
The differences between Square and Adyen
Square and Adyen's core businesses both process mobile, online, and point of sale payments for merchants. However, Square differs from Adyen in three main ways.
First, Square serves consumers with its Cash App, which provides peer-to-peer payments, bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) trades, and free stock trades. Adyen's main app doesn't provide direct peer-to-peer payments, and it doesn't plan to offer bitcoin purchases or integrated stock trades anytime soon.
Square also issues physical debit cards that are linked to users' Cash accounts. Adyen helps merchants issue their own virtual cards, which are basically branded mobile wallets for single businesses.
Second, Square provides a wider range of seller services for analytics, payroll management, and other tasks. Adyen mainly focuses on processing payments instead of selling add-on business services.
Lastly, Square sells first-party POS systems that either run on iOS devices or as stand-alone systems. Adyen's own POS devices are developed by Verifone, but it also provides integrated payment features for other third-party POS systems.
Simply put, Square is a more diversified fintech play, while Adyen resembles a smaller version of PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL). eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY) notably switched from PayPal to Adyen as its online payments provider three years ago, and it plans to complete that transition this year.
How fast is Square growing?
Square's revenue surged 101% to $9.5 billion in fiscal 2020, even as many small businesses closed down during the pandemic.
Image source: Square.
It attributed most of that growth to the expansion of its Cash App, which ended the year with 36 million active customers (up 50% from a year ago), and soaring sales of bitcoin on the platform.
Those strengths offset the softer growth of its core transaction-based revenue, which rose just 7% as many small to medium-sized businesses temporarily closed in the first half of the year.
However, Square's increased dependence on its lower-margin bitcoin revenue squeezed its margins, and its adjusted earnings grew just 5%. Its adjusted EBITDA increased 14% to $474 million.
Analysts expect Square's revenue and adjusted earnings to both increase 45% this year as the pandemic passes and restores the balance between its bitcoin and transaction-based businesses. That recovery depends almost entirely on the U.S. market, which accounted for 97% of its revenue last year.
How fast is Adyen growing?
Adyen's revenue rose 28% to 684.2 million euros ($806.4 million) in fiscal 2020 as the shift to online sales throughout the pandemic offset its loss of brick-and-mortar POS payments.
However, Adyen didn't benefit from surging cryptocurrency prices like Square, and it seems more interested in expanding overseas than launching new services. That conservative approach, along with its lower travel and operating expenses throughout the pandemic, enabled Adyen to grow its full-year earnings 11%. Its adjusted EBITDA increased 27% to 402.5 million euros ($474.4 million).
Analysts expect Adyen's revenue and earnings to grow 39% and 62%, respectively, this year, as the pandemic passes, its brick-and-mortar businesses recover, and it reins in eBay's remaining customers.
Adyen's business is much more geographically diversified than Square's. During fiscal 2020 it generated 62% of its revenue from Europe, 19% from North America, 10% from the Asia-Pacific region, and the remaining 9% from Latin America. That diversification, along with its simpler business model, makes Adyen more of a direct threat to PayPal instead of Square.
Which fintech stock is a better overall value?
Neither stock is cheap right now. Square trades at over 110 times forward earnings and seven times this year's sales. Adyen trades at nearly 140 times forward earnings and 60 times this year's sales.
But if I had to pick one of these fintech stocks over the other, I'd stick with Square for its stronger revenue growth, lower valuations, and bolder expansion plans. Adyen has carved out a niche as a viable alternative to PayPal, but Square is simultaneously disrupting peer-to-peer payments, crypto and free stock trades, and cloud-based enterprise software with its expanding ecosystem.
It's too early to tell if Square's grand ambitions will pay off, but I'd rather pay a premium for those possibilities than Adyen's more conservative strategies.

2021-03-31 00:00:00+00:00,Why Poshmark Stock Is Worth at Least 35% More Than You Think,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-poshmark-stock-is-worth-at-least-35-more-than-you-think-2021-03-31,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Poshmark (NASDAQ:POSH) is looking like a decent buying opportunity right now, given how far POSH stock has fallen lately. In the past month, it is down over 30% as of March 26 at $39.64. It’s down $61.84 or 60.9% from its first day trading close (Jan. 14) of $101.50, and down from the IPO price of $42.
POSH) on a smartphone screen."" width=""300"" height=""169"">

The stock is also a good buy here as it appears cheap compared to a number of other social merchandise sites, given its high take rate. Comparing take rates with associated sales to value ratios allows us to see how cheap POSH stock is now. My estimate is that it is worth at least 35% more at $53.63 per share.
This article will discuss how I came up with that target value.
Poshmark’s Valuation
For example, Poshmark talks a lot about its Gross Merchandise Value (GMV). This is the base of seller transactions on which the company charges its fees, producing revenue. The take rate is the level of revenue divided by the GMV. For example, in Q4 GMV was $387.2 million, up 28% year-over-year. Since net revenue was $69.3 million, the take rate was very high at 17.9% (i.e., $69.3 million divided by $387.2 million).
I wrote an article recently showing that the take rate at Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB) was 14% in 2020 and 4% for Square (NYSE:SQ). But here’s the thing: ABNB stock trades at a forecast 2021 enterprise-to-sales (EV/Sales) ratio of 21 times and SQ stock has an EV/Sales multiple of 13 times.

7 Tech Stocks That Could Be Looking for M&A
By contrast, POSH stock has an EV/Sale multiple of 8.54 times ($2.76 billion EV divided by $323 million in forecast 2021 sales). In other words, these stocks have lower take rates but are more expensive.
Poshmark competes with a number of other social site merchandisers. EBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) is a competitor and had a take rate of 10.9% in Q4 ($2.9 billion in revenue divided by $26.6 billion). But EBAY stock has an EV/Sales multiple of 3.8 times ($45 billion EV / $11.9 billion est. 2021 sales). But eBay is much larger and more mature and profitable than Poshmark. So it has a lower take rate but also a lower EV/Sales multiple.
Etsy (NASDAQ:ETSY) is a similar marketplace merchandiser of used goods (although Poshmark is mostly clothes). Etsy has a higher gross merchandise sales (GMS) take rate than eBay, but lower than Poshmark, but also a higher EV/Sales valuation.
For example, last year, the company had $10.3 billion in GMS and net marketplace revenue (not total revenue) of $1.3 billion. That means its take rate was 12.6%, much lower than Poshmark’s 17.9%. But its enterprise value (EV) of $24.9 billion is 11.5 times its forecast $2.17 billion in sales for 2021. Compare this to POSH stock, which, as I pointed out above, is at just 8.5 times EV-to-sales.
What To Do With POSH Stock
Even if we ignore Poshmark’s much higher take rate vs. Airbnb, Square, eBay and Etsy, its EV/Sales ratio is too low. This assumes that we ignore eBay as an outlier since it is so much larger and mature.
For example, compared to ETSY, the valuation should be 35% higher (i.e., Etsy’s 11.5 times EV/Sales vs. the 8.5 multiple at Poshmark). Given that Poshmark has a much higher take rate, this is more than reasonable.
In fact, POSH stock is worth more than 11.5 times EV/Sales. At the very minimum, it implies that POSH stock is worth $53.63 per share (i.e., 35% above POSH stock’s price of $39.64 per share).
However, take this into consideration. One analyst at Seeking Alpha, in his article, “Poshmark is a Waste of Time for Sellers” makes a valid point that the take rate is its weakness and potential downfall. This is because the high level of fees charged by Poshmark compared to its customers could eventually lead to a lower level of sellers and customers.
In other words, too much of a good thing (for shareholders) is not good for the company and its sellers in the long run. However, here is my retort to that. So far, analysts are predicting higher sales and positive profits for Poshmark. Until sales and profits turn down, it seems to me that POSH stock is still undervalued by at least 35% and is worth at least $53.63 per share.

This video was recorded on March 23, 2021.
Emily Flippen: Welcome to Industry Focus. Today is Tuesday, March 23rd, and I'm the host of this Consumer Goods focused episode, Emily Flippen. Today, I'm joined once again by Motley Fool Analyst Asit Sharma. We're going to talk about another e-commerce reseller that's headed to the public market over the hopefully somewhat near future, ThredUp. Asit, how are you doing today?
Asit Sharma: I'm awesome, Emily, and I'm really excited to talk once again about clothing, about threads. What a really nice name is this, ThredUp, like what-up, ThredUp.
Flippen: It is a nice name. It actually summarizes its business pretty well in a way that we don't see often with resellers. But in case it wasn't completely obvious, a lot of what they're selling are items that have been, you could say, moved up, recycled up the value chain, threaded up, and they're essentially giving new life to millions of items of clothing that people are looking to get out of their closets. We've talked about Poshmark in the past. Hopefully, all of our listeners are somewhat familiar with this industry and the market opportunity headed into today's show.
One of things that I wanted to talk about as it relates to ThredUp, and this is going to be a little bit of a feel before we get into the actual business, is the personal experience I have with ThredUp. When you reached out to me and mentioned that this company had filed its S-1, and was looking to go public, I was really excited, because very rarely do I come across, especially e-commerce businesses focused on clothing that I'm already personally familiar with. Because as we joke, I tend to be a little bit of a thrifty person when it comes to spending money on clothes or, I guess I should say, not spending money on clothes. But I have personal experience with ThredUp. If we rewind to about a year ago and we're looking at the pandemic, we're all stuck at home, I certainly have a lot more time on my hands to do things like watch videos, in particular, videos on YouTube. I found myself going down this weird, somewhat dark place of YouTube watching mostly women do these things called unboxing videos with ThredUp rescue box. They had small businesses, where these people would order boxes from ThredUp, unbox them on camera, and then actually take the items that they were sold and then resell them on other platforms, mostly Poshmark and eBay and sometimes even back to ThredUp.
It's just a weird sub-business that exists in the reselling market where any inventory that sits on ThredUp's hands over an extended period of time, they're able to simply put into a mystery box, sell these mystery boxes to people who then unbox them and then attempt to sell them themselves. It's interesting, it's weird, but it's also a wonderful thing for the world. Not just because it's making entertaining content to keep me entertained for months during a global pandemic, but also because it's extending the life of clothing that otherwise would end up in a dump or in the garbage being completely wasted. It ends up being a pretty good thing for the environment. As we talk about the business today, I think investors will find that that's a trend underlying a lot of the themes of this episode is sustainability.
Sharma: Emily, I'm laughing because you said you went down this hole and it got to be a bit of a dark place. Now, I went back last night and watched a few of these videos because you had mentioned this when we were prepping the episode. I could see how it could quickly become dark for me, because many of these people have super skills. They're pulling the clothes out of the box and they're showing you seams that are invisible to the eye and this is why they rejected it. I'm going to fix this here, I'm going to take this thing out. I'm going to put a hem here, and I started to feel very useless. What have I done with my life? [laughs] Look how amazing [laughs] these folks are. They're contributing to the circular economy. They have a side hustle. They're doing well by the environment. All kinds of things. I could see me watching a lot of those. For me, that would be the darkness of that hole. But we all went down into our own personal YouTube rabbit holes at the beginning of the pandemic. There's nothing too unusual there.
Flippen: I think that it's so important, because there's a skill when it comes to determining what clothes can be resold, how much money you can get for them. We joke about it seeing it on a small scale with these creators on YouTube who are clearly very talented because they have the ability to immediately pull-up an item of clothing out of a mystery box and know what they can get for it. Looking at these little things and determining what value is attractive based on the pilling of the material or whatnot. But that is applied on a bigger level at ThredUp. We can talk through the business cycle for ThredUp. It exists with just you or I. The average person who is looking to, say, clean out their closets. The person goes on, maybe Google searches where they can thrift their clothes to, and ThredUp comes up. They'll give you a box, give you a bag that you can put your clothing in, ship it to ThredUp, and then ThredUp pays a commission when those items sell through their platform. It ends up being a good thing for the person who is selling the clothing because they get a percentage commission off of a clothing that would otherwise have probably ended up in the garbage. It's a good thing for the world, because it's one less piece of clothing in the garbage. It's a good thing for buyers because they're getting a piece of clothing for a discount. For ThredUp operating this platform, it shows a level of skill and their ability to pull clothing in and determine if they can sell it, and if so, how much they can sell it for. It really is a business that benefits from the learning ecosystem that it creates based on the number of items that it brings in.
Sharma: Absolutely. They have spent a lot of money to develop software which gets better and better. Obviously, applying artificial intelligence and machine learning. Not too dissimilar from other platforms that we've seen come public in the last several months. It's such a unique business to me. It reminds us of other platforms. You mentioned Poshmark, which is also reselling clothes. That you're selling peer-to-peer, you're putting clothes up as a listing, someone else is buying them. But it also has similarities to another company called the RealReal, which works on the same type of consignment model. But that's luxury items, a really different type of business model and working on a different average selling price. I was surprised, Emily, or maybe I shouldn't have been, that ThredUp has an average selling price of about $17. For a company over the long term to be able to make good money off of that type of selling price point, is pretty impressive. It gets into some of the economics that you alluded to. In other words, being able to really efficiently figure out through automation, automated software, etc., what items will sell, how to present those items, how to manage that inventory. I think they do all of this really well.
They process a ton of items. They've got three distribution centers across the country and collectively, these distribution centers, let's call them DCs from now on, they're capable of holding about 5.5 million items collectively in inventory. The other really cool thing that they do is they assign a unique stock keeping unit or SKU to every clothing item they process. They can process about 100,000 SKUs per day. Now, why is this impressive? Most items that we're familiar with, have barcodes on them. It's really easy to get a SKUs just by putting a device [laughs] at a barcode. But they have been able to generate SKUs, or find a way to do this without having any barcodes on the clothing. We'll talk a little bit later about how they store their clothes, what these DCs look like. But I think it's an interesting platform in that it combines so many different parts and pieces of other platforms we've talked about, but it's a unique model.
Flippen: I actually love how you connect it to The RealReal because I think my first impression having been somewhat familiar with ThredUp's platform from a consumer's perspective, not from having looked at any of their S-1 or their filings; my impression was that it was going to be closer to a Poshmark or an eBay than something like The RealReal. But they really do have a unique model, and while their price point is below that of the RealReal, I think investors can often overlook the intelligence that comes behind a lot of the work that they do in terms of their SKUs. A lot of their business depends on accurately determining the value of items that they're getting and the mail from people that they don't have the background of. They may be missing items. Maybe there's a tag missing. It becomes a challenging business model to create. They're doing what these individual sellers, like I mentioned on YouTube, are doing where they're applying their own individual knowledge, but they're collecting the knowledge in the aggregate and applying it to millions and millions of items across all of these distribution centers. From a business perspective, I think I have a lot of respect for the time and the energy and the work that goes in behind the scenes to make ThredUp even exist.
Sharma: For sure. We should point out that this company, as of now, isn't trading. It's going to start trading any day. I believe the symbol is going to be TDUP, T-D-U-P. I also wanted to talk a little bit, Emily, about its two major revenue streams. We've already mentioned one, which is selling clothes on consignment. I send them a kit of my clothing. They put it on sale basically, and as those items are purchased, then I'll get a payout. Consignment, pretty easy to understand, but they are also doing something that they call Resale-as-a-Service or RAAS. [laughs] When I saw this acronym I thought, ""Wow, there must be some really automated software type of innovation going on here."" I guess it is innovative, but Resale-as-a-Service is simply their name for getting retail partners like the Gap or Madewell Jeans or Reformation or Walmart, all of which they have partnerships with and helping those retailers to sell used clothing directly back to customers or to participate on the platform with this company. Remember this acronym, RAAS. This is a secondary income stream or revenue stream. But I think it also shows some of the potential of the platform over time to partner up with a lot of retailers and help them participate in the circular economy. It's a way to also broaden out their own gross merchandise volume. That is the total amount of dollars that are transacted over their platform.
Flippen: Traditional retailers have been left out of the upcycling that exists with the reselling. When you think about the breadth that retailers like Walmart have and the scale that they can have to push people who are budget conscious toward resellers as opposed to buying new, especially given the trends in fast fashion that I think a lot of younger consumers are more and more aware of, it's a natural expansion. I remember when Walmart made their initial partnerships with ThredUp and I believe it was mid-2020. I remember thinking in my mind that I thought Walmart was going to make a play to acquire ThredUp or to maybe integrate ThredUp more closely in its business. I actually love the fact that ThredUp to this point at least has stayed relatively independent, because it allows them to partner with more and more of these traditional retailers as opposed to being pigeon helped to one. Either way, it's interesting, I think it's an interesting strategy for them to make these traditional partnerships and again, generally a good thing for the world.
Sharma: I think so too. In their S-1, they're offering documents for their IPO. They mentioned three trends that they think are going to propel the business forward, and why they think they'll have such a wide audience in the future. The first is generational shifts. This is Millennials and Gen Z's who are shifting their preference from new clothes toward resale. I can attest from having friends that are a bit younger than me, and Emily Flippen being one. Also, my kids, that this younger generation, I should say younger than my generation. [laughs] It's really into the idea of the circular economy, getting vintage clothes, just the thrill of going thrifting. I think they're onto something there. They indicate in their prospectus that these two groups are adopting second hand faster than any other age group.
They're also pointing to this rising interest in sustainability, which to me is a slow trend. It's something that many of us have been watching for a long time. The idea that we can live a more sustainable lifestyle is not something that's ever caught fire. But I think with every passing year, more people become aware that we've got to live in a fashion manner that doesn't harm the planet. This is a growing, but a slow-growing trend. Thirdly, they've just pointed out that secondhand is becoming mainstream. I would say that this goes for a lot of stuff, not just fashion. I think of electronics that I've purchased in the past few years. Some of them have been reconditioned. My kids, again, this younger generation, challenged me a couple of times [laughs] over the last several years, ""Dad why are you buying this new? You can reuse something essentially by buying it reconditioned. That's better for the planet and you'll also get a discount and it's just as good as new."" I would never want to believe [laughs] or not that being more old school. But now I'm a happy convert to this type of thinking.
Flippen: I think my favorite aspect of the S-1 was the letter from James Reinhart, who's the Co-Founder and CEO of ThredUp. He founded the company back in 2009. The letter goes like you would expect every S-1 Co-Founder letter to go, except where he includes this visual diagram that he drew out about what he perceives to be a ThredUp's competitive advantage. One aspect that I think really gets at the generational shift in this diagram he drew was unlocking supply. It was one of the key aspects of driving this ""do good"" flywheel competitive advantage. But really his aspect was, we have a generation that wants to do the right thing. That is increasingly trying to do the right thing, but it's challenging, because the vast majority of thrifts or recycling, upselling, it all exists in person, and this is a generation that likes things to be seamless, likes things to be digital or more accustomed to making online purchases.
I love that he highlighted the aspect of reducing the friction of trying to do the right thing. When you look at your closet and you have too much stuff in it that you're trying to get rid of, you want to do the right thing, you don't just want to dump in the garbage. But at the same time, if you're a young person, maybe you're living a very digital-centric lifestyle. Having a platform that reduces the friction, expanding the market, and makes cleaning out your closet easy, while also making the buying process as seamless as possible as well, I think has long-term value and I love to see that written out or visually, I guess I'm a visual person. I love seeing it so visually written out directly in the S-1.
Sharma: That was awesome. Basically, a sketch in his own handwriting. I really like the principles that you've laid out, Emily. This company started as a men's shirt swapping company, because James Reinhart literally did, just as he unlocked the supply, he opened the closet door [laughs] and noticed it was full of clothes he didn't want to wear. He decided to do something with that supply. Hence, this business, which now is going public probably in the next few days.
Flippen: One other aspect before we move on to some of their financial metrics, because it is important to talk about their financial metrics, but one aspect that I saw them breakout, which I was surprised to not only see them break out in the S-1, but how the numbers actually fell, was the demographics that we're purchasing on ThredUp's platform. It does skew young, which you would expect. It does skew female, which again, you would expect, but the one thing I didn't expect was household income. When you look at buyers and sellers on the platform, the single largest demographic for income and the ranges of there's less than $30,000 to $50,000, $50,000 to $100,000, and more than $100,000 is actually the more than $100,000 bracket. It's not just people who are looking to save money out of a perception of necessity, but people who are presumptively pretty well off, that are looking to just make more budget conscious and environmentally friendly decisions. That was one aspect, I saw that and I had to reread it because I didn't really believe my eyes.
Sharma: It's such a great point, because it reinforces their thesis that there is a market for this resale, and it's not just a market that's composed of, let's say, economic necessity, which would be at the bottom of that demographic range. It's something that crosses all demographics and especially pointed once people accumulate enough wealth to be comfortable, or enough annual income to be comfortable, they actually turn their attention to these very things. How do I live a more streamlined life? How do I clear out that closet? How do I do well in the environment? I felt that fascinating and in fact, the company itself, and we'll get to this, I'm prefiguring here a little bit of my thought on this company as investment. This is an idea that I feel like it may take some time to develop, but over the long run the market is there, the product is good, the technology they bring to the table is pretty impressive; it's a company you can visualize getting into steady profits, steady cash flow generation a little easier than some other e-commerce platforms that we've looked at.
Flippen: Speaking of financial state, maybe we should move onto some of their financial performance in key metrics. About on par for the course of what I expected in the business, we have a rapidly growing industry, but again, an industry that doesn't seem to be able to generate any movement on the bottom line, so this is not a profitable business. When you looked over some of the metrics and the analysis from the S-1, what stood out to you, Asit?
Sharma: Emily, I was actually a little impressed by bad financials. [laughs] Let's talk about the metrics. A couple of things that I've learned from you in looking at these platforms to pay attention to really didn't show up. We should say here that in an investment prospectus, in an S-1 statement, you get to choose exactly what details you are going to disclose to prospective investors. Now, the best-case scenarios when you disclose as much as you possibly can about your metrics, and that helps investors make an informed decision and should pump up demand for your stock if you're doing well. They were pretty selective with the metrics that they shared, one that I look at. Gross merchandise volume, this is again, the total amount of dollars that's transacted over an e-commerce platform during a given period. While management discussed ways in which they wanted to grow gross merchandise volume on an annual basis, they actually didn't disclose what that total was, which makes it a little hard to compare to other platforms.
Another thing which I didn't see -- again, this is something I've learned to pay attention to from watching you, Emily, is their cost of acquiring customers. I couldn't find anything that really nailed down what that customer acquisition cost was, and I didn't see any metrics on user churn, so how customers are leaving the platform or decreasing frequency of ordering. They did have some pretty decent metrics on their growth. They broke out their active buyer growth, and you're going to see a pattern here. I will just throw out some numbers here and then we can discuss them. Active buyers grew 10% year-over-year in 2018. They grew 48% year-over-year in 2019, and 24% in 2020. Similarly, orders grew 28% year-over-year in 2018, then 34% in 2019 and peeled back a little bit to 27% growth in 2020. What's going on here is COVID-19, which impacted the company's revenue growth.
What they did was in the second quarter of last year, ThredUp decided to start incentivizing buyers, incentives, promotions, discounts to make sure that they didn't lose customers during the pandemic. You would think that would increase revenue. If buyers and orders grow, they are increasing, but because they net out those incentives and discounts, promotions from their top line, it actually had the effect of muting through revenue growth, and that's why it dropped from 2019 to 2020. These are the major things that stood out to me at a glance at the metrics. Any thoughts on this, Emily, or anything that you saw, that caught your eye?
Flippen: It was interesting to see what they did and didn't break out, and I agree with you, this is a business and I think we've talked about it before you start taping, but this is a business that spends a decent amount on advertising. If you're somebody who watches TV or maybe you watch certain channels on YouTube, ThredUp is not a business that is entirely word of mouth. In my opinion, despite their unique business model, they are still relevant to think about customer acquisition costs. You highlighted some things that I have been mulling over for at least the past day, and I don't have a good answer for it, but why they have such a decrease in the gross profit by cohort, one of the metrics they did breakout is gross profit, which is important given the consignment model, I understand why they are focused on the gross profit as opposed to just gross merchandise volume. They broke out the gross profit from each cohort, and you pointed out that there is a significant drop-off in each year's cohort since 2016 after the first year. While it seems like it studies out a little bit, admittedly at a very smaller level than what it was prior, I can't quite wrap my head around why there is such a steep fall-off. It's actually concerning to me because what it says to me that it is, in order to grow revenue, they need to grow customers, but they're not doing a great job of engaging existing customers, which is a little bit of a concern, especially when you see the significant fall off, and it's not just 2020 where we see that, it's 2019, 2018, 2017. This is a problem that seems to have persisted.
Sharma: It's curious, they have been bouncing out there that each year the new cohort tends to contribute sizeably more gross profit than the year ago cohort. Think of it this way: every year the new customers are contributing more gross profit in their first year than customers contributed in their first year, or the year before. But again, neutralizing that is a drop off from the previous year's cohort from year one to year two. Now when you put it all together, they have a nice graph in their S-1 that shows the trend from 2016-2020. Basically, that gross profit is growing every year and that is helping them scale their business so that they will see some operating leverage hopefully sometime in the future. But it is something without the other types of user metrics that other competitors have disclosed when they went public, we can't really piece together quite what's going on here. Maybe in that first quarter earnings report, they'll be asked by analysts to explain and we'll get some color there, but for now, it's guesswork. Maybe some minor demerit points there. But we should say, on the flip side, their gross margin looks pretty good for a resale platform. Last year, they achieved a gross profit margin of 69% and they achieved a 75% gross margin on their consignment business, which they started to shift completely to starting in 2019. You can put those two together and say the picture is really not that bad, but we'd love some more information to understand these numbers just a bit better.
Flippen: I agree and again, that picture is further muddied because as you mentioned, I think around nearly 80% of their orders come from repeat customers. Finding a way to monetize those cohorts, the people that they've already spent money on to acquire, even better than what they are doing today, retaining them in a stronger way in their second year. I think maybe that's a great opportunity for them. Maybe it's an area that they can genuinely work on and that alone would help increase their gross profit as an overall number. But to your point, yes, it's wonderful to see that they're pulling in new customers and the new customers are increasingly contributing more to that medium line there, I guess I should say, the gross profit line.
Sharma: For sure. I want to quickly mention a couple of other things that are going to help drive that gross profit margin and those gross profits over the next few years. One thing I really liked about this company is that management is obsessed with automation. They remind me, Emily, of Revolve, who we did a deep dive on, I think, in December of last year on Industry Focus. That Revolve which is yet another fashion retailer with an online platform has a management team, again, also holding inventory. Their management team just wants to make things more efficient. Some of the things that stood out in this S-1 is that ThredUp has developed these algorithms to predict demand for sellers items, as well as the optimal payout to offer to the seller, so there's no human intervention there. This is done on pattern recognition. They've won up this by automating one of the most expensive parts of the resale process for any online fashion retailer, and that's photography. They have internally developed software that automatically chooses photo sessions that will drive the highest engagement among potential buyers. When products come in, the software tells the equipment exactly how to take the photograph. I thought that was really cool, and they're doing hundreds of thousands of high-quality photos continuously, 24/7, without the need for professional photographers.
The other thing which really is going to help drive that gross profit in the future and gross margin is this automation of distribution centers. They have these prototype centers. I mentioned they've got centers in three areas of the United States. Within these areas, they've got an older model, and a newer model distribution center. The newer model distribution center uses a patented conveyor and hanger system that extends three stories high to maximize efficiency. If you've seen a picture of this, you can google it on the web, it's futuristic looking to me. It looks like someone took a dry cleaning business [laughs] and pulled it up three stories. It's pretty cool. They think that this newest type of distribution center, which is so highly automated, is going to help keep pushing those gross margins. They show that actually the newer distribution centers have an appreciably better average contribution profit per order. I think this will benefit the company in the long term. They are very focused, as you said, on this idea of extending gross profit, because if you can do that and control your fixed costs, you've got that path to eventual profitability.
Flippen: I wasn't even sure if I should mention this in this episode because it feels maybe just tangential to the conversation. But if anyone has poked around on ThredUp's website, I'm not sure if they had the same reaction that I did, which was, you mentioned the photography that goes into all of these outfits. They're essentially just single pieces, oftentimes you get one or two in stock, they're gone. They may not see that one again, at least not for a long time. Well, the way they have it set up is that every single item is placed on the same mannequin, in the same background. When you scroll through the site, unlike looking through Etsy, unlike looking through Amazon or Poshmark or any of these other sites where you're getting all of these different backgrounds, all of these different lighting situations, you can't really quite tell what is what, having all of the presentations exactly the same, on the same mannequin all your size. It makes shopping so simple and so easy and I am convinced it's because of that focus on automation that management has. It really makes the resale process feel less like I'm reaching into somebody's closet and pulling something random out, and more like I'm making a genuine, almost like new purchased on a perfectly legitimate website.
Sharma: Emily, I'm no MBA, [laughs] but I know this is something they teach in MBA school. But if you can make the process easier for the customer, you'll accelerate your throughput and your sales. They seem to really have done that. They've taken that to heart. I think the money that management has spent, both on the software side and in the physical equipment, is to their advantage over the long term. Which takes us to this equation, we should talk about the financials just a bit. Emily, I know I've thrown out a few impressions to you. What did you see when you were looking through the financials? Then I've got some thoughts as well.
Flippen: Well, I have to admit, I was a little less impressed with the financials than you were, because as we've seen with most resellers, it can be hard to make an entry into the reselling market. It's a slow-moving market. People have been slower to adopt it, but I think we want ThredUp themselves, that they do less than I think 0.1% of all of the potential resold clothes in the United States go over their platform. While it's an opportunity, it also means that they have a lot of challenges in convincing people to use this site. As their revenue has dramatically scaled up over the past year, to me, it was a little bit of a red flag that their losses really hadn't moved, especially their operating loss. I know you maybe take it a little differently because in comparison to other resellers, at least they're not losing even more money. But I wish that their net income or their income statement had scaled as their top line has scaled and we haven't seen that yet, which is a little bit concerning to me.
Sharma: I think those are really valid points. Let me go over some numbers and we can talk about those. Last year, they lost $48 million on $186 million in revenue. If you look just at their operating loss, that's a percentage of about -25%. This loss percentage has helped fairly steady over the last three years. I think it was 22%, maybe two years ago. It's hovered in this 22%-25% range over the last three years. Revenue is scaling, but Emily, as you point out, it's not really dropping to the bottom line. What I liked about this is when you compare this to other competitor, and maybe we're picking on Poshmark [laughs] today, we talked about them a lot. We did a deep dive in January.
Flippen: I know, I feel so bad. It's so top-of-mind.
Sharma: It was top-of-mind, but they have not been able to scale as successfully. Poshmark has a faster growth at higher growth rate, but they are losing a little bit more money as they scale. I think that they actually have an even greater allocation expense to sales and marketing. The other thing which I am going to give them a little pass for is that they did slow down some of their processing of inventory during COVID. Now, that was partly because they wanted to protect employees, so they had some inventory buildup. I'm wondering what the effect of that might've been on just being able to sell last year, maybe we would have seen a bit higher sales. That's what management has indicated in the S-1 in their narrative, that COVID impacted sales in these various ways. I tend to believe that seeing the inventory, I'm wondering maybe if we would have seen a little bit more drop to the bottom line last year had it not been for having to slow down the human components at these distribution centers.
The other thing which I noted as a, I guess a yellow flag is that they've been cash flow negative each year for the last three years. Last year, they had -$19.1 million in operating cash flow, which means they burned through about $19 million in their operations. But they also had $19.4 million in fixed asset addition. If you're one of these people who loves to look at free cash flow, that's about $40 million in negative free cash flow last year. I also noticed that working capital deteriorated over the last year. If you look at their current assets versus their current liabilities, this ratio dropped from a really healthy 2.1 times last year, to 1.2 times by the end of 2020. This simply means that they've got a little bit less of a margin in the current assets, like cash inventory, to cover obligations that are due in one year. Now, the IPO should net ThredUp between $141 million and $163 million. This solves the couple of problems I just talked about. It solves the cash burn problems, it solves the problem with working capital.
You can then take a look at this total financial equation. What I like is that they were able to control those fixed costs. Remember, as they scaled, they didn't really see that benefit hit their bottom line, but the loss didn't widen, which is a signal to me that all things being equal, if they can continue to control that fixed asset base and then tap more of this supply or unleash the supply, unlock the supply with the current gross margins they have, which are slated to grow by probably a few percentage points over the next few years, I could see this company becoming profitable. More like a Revolve which is already profitable, also manages inventory, but does it very carefully. I could see them becoming more like a Revolve in the next four to five years.
Flippen: I could see that as well, and I mentioned early on that one of my hesitations was just the slow adoption. Maybe I was overly bearish on my perception of the adoption of resale, because it is coming. One of the things I did like that we haven't mentioned or I mentioned briefly, but didn't get into was really that market opportunity. I liked the fact that ThredUp split their market opportunity, which they saw as a $20 billion industry today, into two different categories, thrift and resale. I have to be honest, not only pre-reading the S-1, but also during this podcast, I've really been using these two words interchangeably, but they actually refer to two different things: thrift being items that are resold that are not curated, and then resale being items that are selectively sorted for sale. The resale is what ThredUp really is their bread and butter. They're making choices about which items to post on their sites, and that's the segment of the secondhand market that's growing the fastest. That's only $7 billion in 2019. Those are the most updated numbers, but it's expected to get to $36 billion in 2024. So an over 30% CAGR over the past five years or future five years, which is a big opportunity. I can see their, to your points, having some scalability in our financials, especially as the market expands, that we're not seeing today.
Sharma: Absolutely. It's something that has been under, I think, many investors' radar screen. This whole explosion of resale, it tells you why Walmart wants to get in on the game. It also shows you why companies like Levi's are getting into the game as well. Levi's went it alone and they have their own store called Levi's SecondHand. But it's a huge market, so why wouldn't companies try to participate in this? I do like that they've got this fast industry to play with. If they just can grow as quickly as the market, then that's a really phenomenal double-digit growth rate over time. I also like that market opportunity.
Emily, we've got I guess just a few minutes left. I wanted to talk about the social creds that this company has really quickly, because you can't talk about ThredUp without mentioning this. They really want to do well by the environment. I'm going to read you some stats from the S-1, for those of you who are interested in companies that have a focus on sustainability. They say that they have cumulatively saved or displaced a billion pounds of carbon emissions from the atmosphere since they started the company, and they have saved two billion kilowatt-hours of energy. Also, have saved 4.4 billion gallons of water. Also wanted to mention that they discuss the breakdown of their employees and their management, and point out it's not just their customer base that is female, but I think more than half of their employees are female and I think about 30% of the management team is female. If you also like diversity in management and employees, they do that pretty well as well.
Flippen: But with every good thing, there always have to be negatives. As our frequent listeners know, we can't have a podcast where we don't talk about the negatives. I'll kick-off what I think are some of the bigger risks here, and I've made a name for myself, so I need to keep up the name. Asit, this is a company that has weaknesses in their internal controls. I'm not even sure if I should be mentioning this problem anymore, because it has become so pervasive in virtually every company we see go public. In my mind, I had attributed a lot of that to the SPACs, to the unexpected publicness of formerly private companies. But this is a traditional IPO, and I'm not sure if there's an excuse. While they are aware of these issues and they're looking to remediate them, I'm definitely a little bit more aware of the fact that ThredUp, alongside virtually every other company I've looked at over the past year, just can't get their internal controls right, and I hate it. I feel like it's the least you can do if you're going to ask us to give you money.
Sharma: I agree with you, Emily. Part of it may be the allocation of resources in these companies, which is I'm going to call it backward. [laughs] You should be spending some money upfront on your accounting and financial reporting because you never know. [...] I'm really saying this, I tried to give a pass to another company we looked at very recently by saying they've grown as a tech company. They have a very good tech platform. If you look at their hiring, they hired mostly engineers in the early days. Looking at accounting and internal controls, financial reporting, all that came later and they decided they would take advantage. When we were actually talking about it, I think it's a bad company on that day. But if you think you might go public and you've been around since 2009, it's [...] you along the way to bulk up your reporting processes, to bulk up your controls, to make sure that if you ever decide that hey, the market's great, let's go get some funding and go public, you will look pretty good on paper to an auditor. But it seems like there is such a gold rush in the IPO market that's going on now. By gold rush I simply mean there is willing capital, investors will buy a lot of ideas that are out today. I think some companies are changing plans and staying private at a smaller interval than they did. My beef is the same as yours. But if you think that might be an eventuality, why not go ahead and take that cost upfront and build out these controls. I wasn't pleased to see these either.
Flippen: In their defense, they did identify them and try to fix them before going public, but that was after it had already resulted in a material misstatement in prior years. Again, it feels like this really important aspect of what it means to be an investor, and maybe this is a soapbox that I just get on and it's the hill to die on. But it feels like a really critical aspect of evaluating a business is knowing that you can trust the numbers that you're being presented, what management tells you. I hate seeing that because I go back to the first date examples, like being on a date with somebody and not having a clue if anything they told you was true about themselves. But I don't want to harp on it too much. I know for a lot of investors, that isn't quite the deal-breaker that it can be for myself and I'm increasingly trying to get over it. But the other big risk that I see personally is, I just wonder about what happens to discount retail. We've seen a lot of traditional retailers, their inventory end up on the shelves of discount retailers. So it's off brands, even the Targets, the Walmarts of the world, or TJMaxx [TJX], Burlington, all of these businesses that make money by going after thrifters and playing into this experience of finding exciting thrills while you're just treasure hunt, that's the word I'm looking for. I have to wonder if people don't like the in-store shopping experience as opposed to online, especially as it comes to discount goods or resold goods. Since the vast majority of these sales happen in person, I worry a little bit about long term what ThredUp is able to gain in terms of market share for this industry.
Sharma: I think it's a great risk to point out. Either very few companies who do this extremely well, you named one of them, TJMaxx. They've got this global group of buyers that's been together for a long time and they are just really astute at buying out, just close out merchandise of good brand names and they pull people into the stores. This is a big risk for any business that is trying to take a slice of this market. I guess the advantage that they've got is they're pulling a lot of inventory right now from people, from sellers who are cleaning out closets. But as they extend this, again RAAS, so resale as a service and offer it up to other retailers, they increasingly intersect with companies like TJMaxx, who could be a competitive threat in the future as that business grows.
Flippen: A very good point. It's an interesting business, I'm excited about it. I have to say, I think I'm more generally bullish. When I think about the risks here, I feel less worried than I did when even looking at, oh, not the throughout Poshmark, I feel terrible. We've been harping [laughs] on it so much, but I feel better about the write-up that I did about Poshmark. I still think there are a fair number of questions. But personally, I'm interested in this one. I think I'm going to let this one sit as I do most all IPOs, but I like it. I liked it more than I thought I would.
Sharma: Same here, Emily. I'm really thinking that they're only going to be a few players in this space over time that grow into very persuasive investments, but this could be one of them. The reason is that aggressive market growth that you mentioned and the fact that they have a really great system for taking in the merchandise, for displaying it, for moving that merchandise. I think these advantages, if they can grow them, will play out in the future. There's only, I think, so much space though, for online resale of used clothing, if it's not the luxury segment. [laughs] We're talking here again, as we did at the outset, about an average price point of $17, but so far, they've got the niche in this. I will also be following them from quarter-to-quarter. I also feel better about them than I did Poshmark, which has a higher price point, but bigger losses and not as clear a runway to becoming profitable over the long term to me.

2021-03-28 00:00:00+00:00,E-Commerce Play Coupang Looks Appealing on the Dip,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/e-commerce-play-coupang-looks-appealing-on-the-dip-2021-03-28,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
On March 11, Coupang (NYSE:CPNG) launched its IPO, which was the largest foreign company offering since Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) came public in 2014 (the amount raised was a hefty $25 billion). On the first day of trading CPNG stock surged 41%. The company raised roughly $4.6 billion.
CPNG) delivery vehicle."" width=""300"" height=""169"">

Yet CPNG stock has since come under some pressure. The shares have gone from a high of $69 to $43. The market capitalization is currently at about $74.6 billion.
Even though Coupang is a fairly young company – having been founded in 2010 – it has become the largest ecommerce platform in South Korea. Some of its main rivals include Blibli, Jollychic and eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY), which may be interested in exiting the market.
So with the CPNG stock down, might now be a good time to consider a purchase? Well, let’s take a look.
The Platform
For Coupang, the goal is to have its customers say, “How did I ever live without Coupang?” And yes, the company has done a standout job in helping to answer this question!
8 Hot Stocks to Buy for Your Well-Diversified Portfolio
Coupang invested heavily in building a world-class platform. For the most part, it is about not making the typical compromises for ecommerce, such as for customers to choose between fast shipping and low costs.
To do this, Coupang has created a premium subscription service similar to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Prime. It is called Rocket Wow and allows for great delivery options. For example, there is an offering where customers can get shipments within hours as late as midnight and before 7 a.m. This is available for millions of items.
Something else: Over 75% of parcels delivered have zero packing. This means more convenience but also a positive impact on the environment.
OK, then what about returns? Coupang has a frictionless system for this. There is no need to put an item in a box or label it. Instead, a customer just leaves the product outside his or her door.
Keep in mind that the delivery infrastructure includes 25 million square feet of warehouse space across 30 cities in Korea. About 70% of the country’s population is within seven miles of a fulfillment center. Coupang developed its own transportation network, which has about 15,000 full-time drivers (this is the largest delivery fleet in Korea).
Sophisticated IT has also been critical. Coupang developed artificial intelligence and machine learning systems to handle the dynamic changes in demand and optimize inventory, which have been essential for good customer service.
No doubt, this infrastructure has proven effective for other categories. For example, there is Coupang Eats, which is a food delivery system that’s similar to DoorDash (NYSE:DASH). Then there is Rocket Fresh, which is for the delivery of groceries.
And another big driver for growth is third-party sellers. Coupang’s MyStore makes it possible for businesses to sell to a base of 15 million customers.
Bottom Line on CPNG stock
The market opportunity is definitely large for the company. Korea has the fourth-largest economy in Asia and the e-commerce sector is expected to see significant growth. The estimate is for spending to go from $128 billion in 2019 to $206 by 2024, which amounts to a 10% compound annual growth rate. Korea has advantages like high mobile penetration, a thriving middle class and ubiquitous access to high-speed Internet.
Granted, there are risks factors for investors to keep in mind. After all, the company has accelerated the expiration of the lockup on CPNG shares. This will make 34 million shares available for sale by insiders.
Next, the valuation on CPNG stock is still not cheap. Note that the shares trade at 6x sales. By comparison, Amazon is at 4x.
Yet Coupang is growing much faster and is far from a knock-off. The company has been quite innovative. So all in all, for those investors looking to get exposure to the ecommerce megatrend outside the U.S., CPNG stock is a good way to do this.

2021-03-27 00:00:00+00:00,How Nike Is Winning in E-Commerce,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/how-nike-is-winning-in-e-commerce-2021-03-27,,,"Nike (NYSE: NKE) had an eventful 2020 as the pandemic forced its shops and wholesale partners to close their doors. With so much disruption to the iconic brand's business model, it had to be flexible and creative to continue delivering for shareholders in the new environment. And it did just that.
Let's dive into the operational changes Nike made, and how they could position the company for an even stronger future.
Image source: Getty Images.
Winning in digital
In the company's most recent quarter (ended Feb. 28), total sales rose 3% year over year. While this may not seem significant to some, when dissecting the growth, it becomes much more interesting.
Digital sales soared 59% year over year with double-digit growth in every single geography. Even more encouraging, these numbers would have actually been better if not for global container shortages that affected inventory shipments. In other words, Nike could have sold even more merchandise if it had the inventory available to do so.
From a company demand perspective, Nike CFO Matthew Friend expects the digital evolution to boost key growth drivers such as women's apparel. Each direct-to-consumer sale gives Nike greater visibility into consumer data, allowing it to control inventory more effectively. And Friend ""continues to see the value of a more direct, digitally-enabled strategy fueling ever greater potential over the long term.""
The outperformance in digital is not just welcomed from a revenue standpoint. A shift from wholesale distribution to digital sales affects the company's margin profile as well. Nike enjoys a gross profit margin roughly 10 percentage points higher for digital sales than for wholesale. With that in mind, a lasting shift to digital business could create a permanent boost to the company's profits.
In the fiscal 2021 third quarter, Nike did see its gross profit margin expand 130 basis points to 45.6%, and it also delivered a 14.0% net income margin versus 8.3% in the prior-year period. This is undeniably positive, and there is likely a runway for further expansion as management expects digital to make up 30% of the business by fiscal 2023.
The margin expansion and revenue boost also allowed Nike to raise its dividend for the 19th consecutive year, despite all of the challenges the pandemic presented.
Nike is in very good hands
John Donahoe took over the chief executive role at Nike in Jan. 2020. He brought with him an impressive resume and deep understanding of what it takes to create a successful digital offering.
For example, he can take his cloud computing know-how from ServiceNow, his payments expertise from PayPal, and his marketplace prowess from eBay to drive success for the sports apparel company. Given how Nike outperformed many of its competitors during the pandemic, Donahoe seemed to handle his tumultuous first year quite well.
Overall, Nike's ability to successfully transform its business model amid the COVID-19 pandemic is admirable. Not every company has the ubiquitous brand, deep pockets, and strong leadership Nike possesses, but most importantly, the global powerhouse leveraged those advantages to prioritize e-commerce and come out ahead in the past year. In my view, investors can feel very comfortable buying shares of Nike stock.

2021-03-25 00:00:00+00:00,May 7th Options Now Available For eBay,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/may-7th-options-now-available-for-ebay-2021-03-25,,,"Investors in eBay Inc. (Symbol: EBAY) saw new options begin trading today, for the May 7th expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the EBAY options chain for the new May 7th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $57.00 strike price has a current bid of $2.20. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $57.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $54.80 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of EBAY, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $58.04/share today.
Because the $57.00 strike represents an approximate 2% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 100%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 3.86% return on the cash commitment, or 32.76% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for eBay Inc., and highlighting in green where the $57.00 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $58.50 strike price has a current bid of 94 cents. If an investor was to purchase shares of EBAY stock at the current price level of $58.04/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $58.50. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 2.41% if the stock gets called away at the May 7th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if EBAY shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for eBay Inc., as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing EBAY's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $58.50 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $58.50 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 1.62% boost of extra return to the investor, or 13.75% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.
Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $58.04) to be 34%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

See the 10 stocks
*Stock Advisor returns as of February 24, 2021
Brian Withers: You want to talk about MercadoLibre's business model?
Brian Stoffel: Yes. I'll kick it off and we'll talk about MercadoLibre's business model. They've got a couple of different things. I think it's worth just telling their story. They started out as an online marketplace similar to what eBay is today. In fact, eBay was one of the early investors. The marketplace is still the key, and so they color code their results here. They haven't put one out for the fourth quarter, which is annoying. But that's OK. We can just use this one for the third quarter and it will still tell the story.
They basically, by Marketplace, what that means is it just like Amazon. You can go, you can look for something. Amazon itself does not provide the majority of the goods on Amazon anymore. They just facilitate it. In other words, they have the website and that website is gold because everybody goes there and everybody list there and they get to collect money because that's the place where everybody goes. That's what MercadoLibre has, too. They don't actually own much of the inventory that they ship to people. They just facilitate it. They make it easier for it to happen. As you can see, there's three key countries that they're in: Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico. These are foreign currency-neutral growth rates during the third quarter of last year. As you can see, it's growing like bonkers, just crazy fast. Some of that has to do with the fact that currencies can be quite volatile. But the bottom line is that it grows very quickly.
But that's just the first part because then we get to the other part, that's part of the e-commerce, which is Mercado Envios which is logistics. This is a big deal because this is something that says eBay didn't really get into of owning huge fulfillment centers and creating systems to help people ship things across the country. eBay, more or less relied upon UPS, FedEx, and the U.S. Postal Service to do this work in the United States. What MercadoLibre did was they took a page out of Amazon's book and they said, forget that. We're going to own the logistics process. It's a big deal. Because if you look here, you see that over 90% of the things that are shipped, that are bought on the marketplace are shipped using Mercado Envios. That's a lot of money to pay upfront. But as we get into later, it creates a powerful moat in terms of low-cost production.
What I mean by that is that for MercadoLibre to ship something from point A to point B within Latin America, their internal costs for doing that is going to be lower than an upstart who has to use the local postal services, who has to use MercadoLibre's Mercado Envios, or who tries to build out their own because this is expensive. It's really expensive to do.
Then the other one that they still report on, and there are others that I will talk about in a second is Mercado Pago. This is the Amazon Web Services for MercadoLibre. What I mean by that is, this is the thing that wasn't in the original business plan right when it was hatched that has just exploded. Originally, this was a way to get people to pay for things on the marketplace. In other words, there are a ton of people in Latin America who are unbanked or under-banked. In other words, they don't really have a way to pay for things before this came along to buy them online.
Because normally you pay for things with cash and you can't put your cash into a computer no matter how hard you try, doesn't work. They created a way to do that with Mercado Pago, much like Venmo or PayPal. What they've seen is that it was meant to grease the wheels of the first section up here so people could buy things. But what's happened over time is that more and more and more, it's being used to pay for things not on the marketplace.
What do I mean by that? I live in Latin America for part of the year and I go to the corner store for stuff almost every day and usually I pay with cash. But if Mercado Pago was popular in Costa Rica, which is where I go, I could use that to pay for my groceries, my gas, things like that because they have mobile point-of-sale devices everywhere, and those point-of-sale devices, that's what you put your credit card into or which you swipe your credit card through. They have developed a way to pay for things that are off their platform and that is just massive.
One other thing I just wanted to show to give you an idea of where this growth comes from. It's not just these things. It's also things like Mercado Credito. They didn't break that out in this quarter, but it's credit. They have Meli Air. They just launched in the fourth quarter of last year, which is part of Mercado Envios. Envios mean shipping, where they have a fleet [of airplanes] or that they're building out to ship things via air. They're taking the page right out of Amazon's playbook. Brian, can you tell me, can you see this chart right here?
Withers: Yes.
Stoffel: Basically, this blue part right here is their sales in e-commerce and that's in millions of dollars. Then the red is what they collected via Mercado Pago. Basically, things like Mercado Envios, building websites, their advertising that they sell in the marketplace itself. That's all the blue. Mercado Pago, Mercado Credito, things like that, that's in the red. Bottom line their e-commerce is growing, but the revenue is growing by 75% per year over the last three years. Their fintech is growing by 53%, both impressive.
The big three are the Marketplace, Mercado Pago, Mercado Envios, but there's so many more that they are putting in there. There's just a whole lot of other ways that they are continually finding new solutions to fulfill their mission, which is to democratize commerce and finance in Latin America. That's their business model.

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.

Along with most other high-growth companies, Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB) stock has come under pressure during the past few weeks.
ABNB) app on a smartphone screen"" width=""300"" height=""169"">
Source: BigTunaOnline / Shutterstock.com
Yet the decline has not been steep. ABNB stock has fallen about 10% from its high of 216.84, closing yesterday at $194. But the shares are still up about 185% since the company’s high-profile IPO in December. The company’s market capitalization is about $118 billion.
Among the many unicorns that have come public over the past few years, Airbnb is certainly a standout name. And despite the company’s high valuation, the stock’s prospects continue to look promising.
For the following three reasons, the outlook of ABNB stock remains strong.
Airbnb’s Strong Management Team
Since the founding of Airbnb in 2008, its management team has proven to be quite effective. The company has been able to fend off a variety of competitors because of its focus on making its site easy to use and highly engaging.

7 Manufacturing Stocks That Will Help You Build a Better Portfolio
But with the emergence of the Covid-19 pandemic, Airbnb’s management team was tested in a big way. The company swiftly cut its costs, laying off 25% of its global workforce and suspending various initiatives. To shore up its finances, the company raised $2 billion through debt.
Yet perhaps Airbnb’s most important move was its decision to focus on short domestic bookings. That step helped to reduce the impact of the pandemic. For example, in the fourth quarter, the company’s revenue only fell about 22% year-over-year, even though another major surge of the virus resulted in many lockdowns.
In fiscal 2020, there were 193.2 million nights and experiences booked and the company reported gross billings of $23.9 billion.
The Powerful Business Model
Online marketplaces often have a “winner-take-all” advantage. That is because of network effects, which is a process in which a service becomes more valuable as it is used by more people. That is why platforms like eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) and Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) have remained so strong for many years.
Airbnb is dominant in the vacation-home rental category. It has 5.6 million active listings across over 220 countries and regions.
Airbnb’s strong brand has enabled it to become the top-of-mind site for the industry. Because of that, over 90% of the company’s traffic comes from sources that do not cost it anything.
Meanwhile, the company’s market opportunity is massive. According to Airbnb’s S-1, its total addressable market is a whopping $3.4 trillion. That includes:
$1.8 trillion for short-term stays
$210 billion for long-term stays
$1.4 trillion for experiences.
In other words, Airbnb has a great deal of room to grow.
The Reopening and ABNB Stock
As a result of the rollout of the vaccines made by Pfizer (NYSE:PFE), Moderna (NASDAQ:MRNA) and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), it looks like the U.S. economy is poised for growth again. Indeed, the Federal Reserve recently upgraded its forecast for 2021 U.S. GDP (Gross Domestic Product) from 4.2% to 6.5..
Moreover, it appears that there is significant pent-up demand for travel. According to Airbnb: “More than half of those surveyed (54%) said they either already booked, are currently planning to travel, or expect to travel in 2021. This includes 57% of 18- to 29-year-olds, and 60% of 30- to 49-year-olds.”
So Airbnb’s growth is poised to accelerate. And all in all, ABNB stock should be a pretty good way to play the reopening trade, which seems to be a big focus for Wall Street now.

SEOUL, March 16 (Reuters) - South Korea's SK Telecom 017670.KS, retailer Shinsegae Group and private equity firm MBK Partners were among those that entered non-binding, preliminary bids for the sale of eBay Inc's EBAY.O South Korean business, the telecom company and two sources with knowledge of the matter said on Tuesday.
EBay Korea operates open market e-commerce platforms Gmarket, Auction and G9, and was South Korea's third-largest e-commerce firm in 2020 with 12.8% market share, according to Euromonitor.
The sources declined to be identified as not authorised to talk to media. MBK Partners, Shinsegae Group and eBay Korea declined to comment.
Seoul-based analysts said that eBay hopes to fetch up to 5 trillion won (S4.42 billion) with the sale.
However, they said the actual sale price may be lower, due to its recent drop in market share compared to rivals such as Korea's No. 1 e-commerce firm Coupang CPNG.N, and disadvantages of the unit's traditional ""open market"" form of e-commerce which simply connects sellers with buyers.
EBay Korea's market share has been overtaken in recent years by Coupang, which directly handles inventory, differentiated itself with speedy delivery and raised around $4.6 billion in a blockbuster New York listing earlier this month, as well as Naver Corp 035420.KS, which operates South Korea's dominant online search portal.
EBay Korea's 2020 revenue was estimated to be about 1.3 trillion won, with a 5.3% on-year increase in transactions, compared to a 19% growth in South Korean e-commerce market, KTB Investment & Securities analyst Kim Jin-woo said.

BOSTON, March 15 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs GS.N ranked as the top financial adviser to companies targeted by activist investors in 2020, holding onto the top ranking for the second straight year, according to Refinitiv data published on Monday.
During 2020, Goldman advised on 49 campaigns, including Twitter TWTR.N, EBay EBAY.O and Harley Davidson HOG.N , down modestly from 53 in 2019.
The top 10 advisers worked on 186 campaigns last year, when the pandemic curbed activism, compared with 197 in 2019.
Morgan Stanley, which held the No. 1 spot for several years, slipped to the No. 3 position, having worked on 26 campaigns in 2020 after 44 campaigns in 2019.
Spotlight Advisors, which works for both companies and activists, moved into the No. 2 spot with 31 campaigns.
Bank of America, Lazard and Evercore followed with 22, 17 and 14 engagements respectively.
Various providers compile league tables that are often used as data points to woo new clients. But they seldom tell the entire story, bankers say, noting that discrepancies can arise because many companies fend off activists privately and ask their advisers to stay silent about their involvement.
Elliott Management held onto its spot as the busiest activist, having launched 17 campaigns last year after 11 in 2019.
Olshan Frome Wolosky was the busiest law firm, working on 85 engagements for activists. Vinson & Elkins LLP, which handled 47 campaigns, including six for activists and 41 for companies, followed in the No. 2 spot. Sidley Austin LLP tied V&E with 41 company engagements and ranked in the No. 3 spot.
Innisfree and Okapi Partners were the top proxy solicitors.

The coronavirus accelerated the move to digital payments, and it's capturing more transactions from more customers than ever before. On a Fool Live episode recorded on March 3, Fool contributors Brian Withers and Matt Frankel discuss the quarter and talk about how this digital payments processor is still just in the early innings of the long-term trend toward a cashless economy.
Find out why PayPal Holdings is one of the 10 best stocks to buy now
Motley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent more than a decade beating the market. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, Motley Fool Stock Advisor, has tripled the market.*
Tom and David just revealed their ten top stock picks for investors to buy right now. PayPal Holdings is on the list -- but there are nine others you may be overlooking.
Click here to get access to the full list!
*Stock Advisor returns as of February 24, 2021
Matthew Frankel: For sure. Moving on to PayPal, which I would argue had the best quarterly report of all 10 companies on this list, and I'll tell you why in a second. First of all, just a couple of one recent news item that I found really interesting. Everyone knows the cryptocurrency mania is going on bitcoin [is] over $50,000. Every company is jumping into it in some way, PayPal is no exception. We've talked about it before that, you can now buy and sell bitcoin through PayPal and Venmo. They're eventually going to roll it out as a payment mechanism.
Now we hear that PayPal is actually going to buy a crypto-custody firm called Curv. That's one of the latest news items that are doubling down on their cryptocurrency ambitions. I'll save my bitcoin and cryptocurrency ambitions or comments for another segment. But, that could potentially be a needle mover for the business.
As I mentioned, extremely strong earnings report, really not get out of the park. PayPal added 72.7 million active accounts in 2020. There are now 377 million people who use PayPal and/or Venmo, $936 billion total payment volume in 2020, and that grew throughout the year to where now, they have over one trillion dollar run rate of payment volume flowing through their system. That is huge for this used to be just a niche eBay's payment process back in the day. They have grown tremendously. They processed more than 15 billion individual payment transactions last year, 15 billion.
Their earnings grew 31 percent year-over-year. Venmo's revenue grew more than 50 percent, 56 percent revenue growth in payment processing volumes growth in Venmo. Unlike a lot of the big growth stocks we're talking about, PayPal is a highly profitable business, they generated five billion dollars of free cash flow last year. They're expecting similar results for this coming year, they're expecting 19 percent revenue growth, they expect to add another 15 million new active accounts in 2021.
So what I'm watching, I got to say, I am approaching their 2021 forecast with a healthy dose of skepticism. I'm skeptical as to whether their momentum is going to continue after the pandemic goes dies down. Whether people are still going to shopping quite as much on online, whether people are still going to be searching for new ways to send money to their friends and to pay for purchases and etc. I think the Bitcoin thing could help to add some of that 15 million new member projection they're talking about, that will certainly increase engagement on the platform. Until now, that's been a big differentiator of the cash app [from Square] so that you can buy and sell bitcoin, and that's no longer unique to the cash app there.
Also, a few key developments in their business outside of the crypto thing. They recently launched the Venmo credit card, I think that went live in October. That's a product definitely worth watching, watching their buy now, pay later service. A company called Affirm recently went public, that's the leader in the buy now, pay later space. I want to see PayPal really disrupt that. I think Affirm has a $30 billion market cap by itself, I could even be underestimating that.
There's a lot of excitement going on in PayPal's business. The company is really firing on all cylinders. I wish I hadn't sold my shares after the eBay spinoff. I was eBay shareholders and got a chunk of PayPal when they spun the business off. I sold it nearly triple what I got it for, but that's a drop in the bucket compared to where it is now. I bet you Brian is a PayPal shareholder though.
Brian Withers: Oh, no. Rub that in. That was one of the stocks I trimmed over the last two years. Part of why I was worried about PayPal was just all the competition that seems to be out there. It seems to be a new FinTech born every minute, it's in the payments. Square is knocking it out of the park, MasterCard's not given up this fight, and Shopify is doing its own payment system, MercadoLibre and whatnot.
What is PayPal have that is differentiated among these other ones? You can see that it's just far superior platform and it continues to monetize and gain members. To me, the stat that I think about, Matt, you were worried about e-commerce penetration. Q4 in the US, as much as it grew over the past year with COVID, we're still only at 16 percent of retail purchases are done online today, the value.
So I still think we've got a long way to go and PayPal is doing a great job in capturing the market there.
Matthew Frankel: I mean, PayPal's really surprised me. PayPal and Square combined have just really surprised me as in how much those have caught on over the years. I knew that the digital transformation of payments was going to happen. I didn't think it was going to be quite as quick as it is.
Brian Withers: Yeah, that tollbooth model is incredibly lucrative for those companies.

2021-03-13 00:00:00+00:00,3 Stocks That Could Double Your Money,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-stocks-that-could-double-your-money-2021-03-13,,,"Simply parking most or all of your long-term investing dollars in a low-fee, broad-market index fund such as one that tracks the S&P 500 is a great way to invest -- and even Warren Buffett has recommended that strategy for most of us. Less those low fees, it will get you roughly the same return as the market (as measured by the index it tracks). Great, right?
Well, that is great, but the stock market has averaged annual returns of close to 10% over long periods, and over your investing time frame, it might return a bit more or less. If you crave faster growth, and you're willing to learn more about investing and take on more risk, you might invest a portion of your portfolio in some carefully chosen individual stocks.

Here are three contenders for your portfolio, each of which may double your money in just a few years -- or perhaps a bit longer. (The stock market offers few guarantees, and slumps can happen at any time.)
1. MercadoLibre
If you know a little Spanish, you might notice that MercadoLibre (NASDAQ: MELI) means ""free market"" -- so you won't be surprised to learn that it's an e-commerce enterprise. It's a big one, too, recently valued near $80 billion, and focused on Latin America. While $80 billion is a lot, it's still a far cry from the recent $1.6 trillion value of Amazon.com or the $658 billion value of China's mega e-commerce concern, Alibaba. And yes, while China is extremely populous, containing more than a billion consumers or potential consumers, the population of Latin America and the Caribbean is meaningful, too, at more than 658 million -- that's about twice the U.S. population. MercadoLibre has plenty of room for further growth.
MercadoLibre has been a good grower for a long time, gaining more than 1,800% over the past decade, and it has been innovative, too, capitalizing on opportunities. While starting out as more of an eBay-like business, it's now more like Amazon, and it has its own PayPal-like digital payment arm, too, in MercadoPago.
2. Redfin
Next up is Redfin (NASDAQ: RDFN), a relatively new business in the real estate market, founded just 15 years ago. Like Zillow, it lets homebuyers shop for homes online through its listings, and it sports its own team of real estate agents, too, who charge lower fees than mainstream realtors. (It notes, ""Since our launch in 2006, we have saved our customers nearly $1 billion and we've helped them buy or sell more than 310,000 homes worth more than $152 billion."")
Like MercadoLibre, Redfin is also expanding its scope and reach, adding a mortgage and title business and buying RentPath to add apartment-hunting services to its offerings. (If you haven't heard of RentPath, perhaps you've heard of one of its sites, such as Rent.com, ApartmentGuide.com, Lovely, and Rentals.com?) Redfin's RedfinNow service even buys homes directly from homeowners to resell.
Redfin has a lot going for it, such as a booming real estate market and a relatively attractive valuation. Consider, for example, that Zillow was recently valued near $38 billion, while Redfin is still near $7.9 billion. Redfin's recent price-to-sales ratio of 7.8 is likewise lower than Zillow's 9.9. This company appears to be well-positioned for further growth, with a management team ready and able to capitalize on opportunities that come along.

3. Teladoc Health
Finally, there's Teladoc Health (NYSE: TDOC), the telemedicine specialist that was soaring during the pandemic as more and more patients and doctors turned to virtual visits. The stock has retracted some recently, down about 35% from its 52-week high, but it has been performing well. The company's year-end results featured revenue nearly doubling to $1.1 billion, and total healthcare visits surging by 156% to 10.6 million. (Visits in the U.S. nearly tripled in number.)
Late last year, Teladoc expanded its scope by buying Livongo for about $18.5 billion. Livongo specializes in ""applied health signals"" and offers diabetes monitoring products, among other things. Its diabetes program pairs a glucose monitor with patient-coaching software, encouraging more activity, among other things. The U.S. is home to more than 34 million diabetics (more than one in 10 people) and some 88 million pre-diabetics. The company aims to expand into monitoring and addressing other widespread conditions, too, such as high blood pressure and obesity. Clearly, there is much more room to grow.
These are just three of the many promising businesses out there that deserve consideration for a berth in your portfolio. If any of them interest you, take a closer look.

Ecommerce stocks are taking a beating on Wednesday as news of states reopening worries investors in online retailers.
Source: William Potter / Shutterstock.com
Among the stocks falling today are Etsy (NASDAQ:ETSY), Fiverr International (NYSE:FVRR), Wayfair (NYSE:W), eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY), and Shopify (NYSE:SHOP). Even ecommerce giant Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is seeing a dip in its stock today, but it isn’t as bad as the others.
One of the major catalysts for ecommerce stocks falling today is Texas announcing an end to its restrictions concerning the novel coronavirus. The state is no longer requiring residents to wear masks and is letting businesses return to normal operations.
Most states are already done with stay-at-home orders, though there are a few still holding out. On that same note, many are allowing businesses to operate fully, but still have mask mandates in place.

With more states reopening, it only makes sense that ecommerce stocks would take a hit. That’s largely due to the prospect of lost business as customers return to normal shopping habits.
On the flip side, retail companies could finally make a comeback with a return to normal operations. While it’s true that many were struggling before the coronavirus pandemic hit, an end to lockdowns could boost business. That would likely be due to an increase in shopping at physical stores from customers tired of being cooped up at home over the last year.
ETSY stock was down 10.7%, FVRR stock was down 7.8%, W stock was down 6.4%, EBAY stock was down 3%, SHOP stock was down 5.1%, and AMZN was down 1.7% as of Wednesday afternoon.

2021-02-26 00:00:00+00:00,Interesting EBAY Put And Call Options For October 15th,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/interesting-ebay-put-and-call-options-for-october-15th-2021-02-26,,,"Investors in eBay Inc. (Symbol: EBAY) saw new options begin trading this week, for the October 15th expiration. One of the key inputs that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 231 days until expiration the newly trading contracts represent a possible opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the EBAY options chain for the new October 15th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $55.00 strike price has a current bid of $5.30. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $55.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $49.70 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of EBAY, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $56.97/share today.
Because the $55.00 strike represents an approximate 3% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 60%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 9.64% return on the cash commitment, or 15.23% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for eBay Inc., and highlighting in green where the $55.00 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $60.00 strike price has a current bid of $4.95. If an investor was to purchase shares of EBAY stock at the current price level of $56.97/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $60.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 14.01% if the stock gets called away at the October 15th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if EBAY shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for eBay Inc., as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing EBAY's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $60.00 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $60.00 strike represents an approximate 5% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 52%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 8.69% boost of extra return to the investor, or 13.73% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.
The implied volatility in the put contract example is 43%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 38%.
Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $56.97) to be 38%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

2021-02-26 00:00:00+00:00,Better Buy: Shopify vs. Zoom Video Communications,EBAY,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/better-buy%3A-shopify-vs.-zoom-video-communications-2021-02-26,,,"The coronavirus pandemic caused many changes, but increases in online shopping and remote work have been two of the most prominent trends. Not surprisingly, Shopify (NYSE: SHOP) and Zoom Video Communications (NASDAQ: ZM) benefited greatly from these secular shifts and made many investors much wealthier in the process. In fact, share prices of Shopify soared 160%, and Zoom stock surged 288% over the last year.
But which of these tech stocks is the better buy today? Let's dive in.
Shopify: Simplifying digital commerce
Shopify's digital commerce platform supports over 1.7 million global merchants, helping them create and manage online shops across different channels. For example, merchants can sell through the web storefronts, mobile apps, social media, and marketplaces. In each case, Shopify has solutions for everything from inventory management to payment processing.

One of the great things about Shopify is that it helps merchants build a brand name and develop customer relationships. This differentiates the company from digital marketplaces like Amazon and eBay, where all sellers operate on the same platform. For instance, do you remember your last Amazon purchase? Who was the seller? I purchased something from Amazon last week, and I can't recall who sold the product. That's fine in some cases, but it's not a good strategy for building a brand name.
To further empower its merchants, Shopify launched the Shop App in April 2020, which provides consumers with personalized recommendations based on past purchases and the brands they follow. This helps drive repeat purchases and deepens customer engagement. The Shop App also incorporates parcel tracking and Shop Pay, the company's accelerated checkout experience, which improves conversion rates by up to 18%.
Shopify's merchant-centered solutions have helped the company grow revenue and grab market share exceptionally quickly, especially in the wake of the pandemic.

In the years ahead, as digital commerce becomes a larger part of total retail, Shopify should continue to benefit. And given that management sees a $153 billion market opportunity in small- and medium-sized businesses alone (i.e., not including larger brands or micro-merchants), the company still has a long runway for growth.
Zoom Video Communications: Modernizing meetings
Zoom's unified communications platform offers video, voice, chat, and content-sharing solutions across devices. This makes it easy for friends, families, and teams to stay connected. Not surprisingly, as businesses shifted to work-from-home models during the pandemic, Zoom's platform benefited from strong demand.
While rival products like Microsoft Teams and Cisco Webex benefited from the same tailwinds, Zoom expanded much more rapidly, taking market share in the process. In fact, Zoom has surpassed both Cisco and Microsoft to become the market leader in video-conferencing software. So what made the difference?
One of the driving forces behind this incredible growth is Zoom's focus on customer satisfaction. Ensuring a good user experience is core to the company's growth strategy, and that has helped Zoom achieve a higher net promoter score (a measure of how likely customers are to recommend the product) than any of its rivals: Zoom scores 66, while Cisco Webex and Microsoft Teams score 46 and 55, respectively.
Put simply, Zoom is one of the simplest, most functional meetings solutions on the market, and that has translated into strong customer and revenue growth.

Currently, Zoom offers a number of other products that could further boost adoption. For instance, Zoom Rooms combines the company's meetings software with third-party hardware installations (soundbars, cameras, computers, touch screens) enabling clients to turn corporate offices into modern video-conferencing suites. This makes it easy to schedule and manage virtual meetings, and it should help Zoom continue to take market share even when (or if) employees return to corporate offices.
As a final thought, in Zoom's SEC Form S-1 filing, management indicated a market opportunity of $43 billion by 2022. However, potential use cases have expanded in the wake of the pandemic (i.e., remote work, remote education, telemedicine), and the company's market opportunity is likely much larger now. In other words, despite tremendous growth last year, Zoom still has plenty of room to run.
The verdict
Shopify trades at 485 times earnings, and Zoom trades at 254 times earnings. In both cases, the valuation is astronomical. Investors that are uncomfortable with high volatility should avoid both of these stocks.
That being said, quickly growing businesses like Shopify and Zoom typically reinvest a substantial portion of revenue back into the business, making them hard to value with price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios.
So which is the better investment? While both of these tech stocks could be long-term winners, my money is on Shopify. The e-commerce market is big and getting bigger, and the company's merchant-first approach should continue to resonate with clients for many years to come.
